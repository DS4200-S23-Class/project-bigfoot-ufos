00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.300
Bigfoot and UFO sightings are self-reported to&nbsp;
the Bigfoot field researchers organization and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.600
the National UFO Reporting Center.&nbsp;
To learn more about these reports,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.060
we created our visualizations. On the left is&nbsp;
our map containing all of the Bigfoot and UFO&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.560
sightings and on the right we have a bar chart&nbsp;
containing the number of sightings by month.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.320
The orange points are for Bigfoot sightings&nbsp;
and the blue points are for UFO sightings. On&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.840
the map you can zoom and pan across the United&nbsp;
States. As I am looking at different locations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.060
the data on our right bar plot is filtered to&nbsp;
match the points currently in view on the map.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.900
On the bar chart you may hover on top of a bar&nbsp;
which will cause a tooltip to appear with the type&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.840
and exact amount of sightings. To see the sighting&nbsp;
in more detail you can click on a point on the map

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.620
As you can see, when you click a&nbsp;
pop-up will appear with specific&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.180
information on the sighting and on the right&nbsp;
a summary of the reported sighting appears.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.700
To look only at Bigfoot or UFO sightings&nbsp;
you can use our filter on the legend
