Coming out of church last night, myself and two other ladies were in the parking lot talking and about to leave.  A red fireball object, kind of dancing, maybe a drone, slowly came toward us at about 75 feet above our heads, hovered over us for about a minute and then slowly went out site behind trees.  We then saw a large plane flying much higher seconds later.  As we left the church separately, I drove alone to try and find it for 5 minutes.  I pulled into a parking lot on Old Birminhame Hwy of an abandoned store, 6 blocks from the church.  I spotted it up on the mountain above trees just up behind the area of the church, but the light was white, and no red.  It hovered moving slowly. No houses there.  I saw it head West toward the direction of Lincoln.  I drove West on the Old Birmingham Hwy.  It was beside me on the left in the sky, keeping pace with my car at about 30mph.  I was on the phone talking to another church member about it.  I lost sight of it when I came around a curve. Coming out of the curve, I spotted it again, on the right side of me, but it was way ahead, a couple miles down the road at the Lincoln area already in seconds, then it disappeared.  I wondered if it was a Homeland Defense drone or something.  No other reports had been made about it to the Sheriff.

As I was driving an early AM paper route this morning, I noticed in the Eastern sky a large, bright silver-white light strobing in an alternating pattern with a single red light.  The red light, oriented to the South of the craft, would flash first, followed about ¼ second later by the white light.  The red light was flashing about once per second.  The craft at first was moving in a Northward direction, then after a few minutes, it began to move southward. I noted that there was no sound, and the craft seemed very low in the sky, maybe 3,000- 5,000 ft.   I am not a good judge of altitude, but it occurred to me that had it been a plane, it would have been making a landing approach to be that low or close.  Also, had it been a helicopter, I would most definitely have heard the chopping propeller sound since it was so close.  There was never any jet or chopper noise, and I had my window rolled down completely in the vehicle. 
 
As I proceeded southward along my route, moving from the Keyport region, into Brownsville/Illahee, I was able to periodically track the motion of the object at certain points where the view to the East allowed.  It continued gliding slowly in both directions (North for a few minutes, then South, always remaining to my East out over the Puget Sound.)  At one point during the sighting, I noticed that it appeared to have changed orientation and I could see three solid bright white/silver lights in a line, (maybe facing toward me, rather than parallel to me.)  I thought that it might be a triangular shape and that the three lights denoted the tips.  The middle light seemed to be a little brighter or larger, maybe due to being closer from my perspective.   
 
The entire sighting took place over a period of 20-30 minutes between about 2:45 AM and 3:15 AM. I eventually lost my line of sight due to natural obstructions (a heavily wooded area.)",47.59320484848485,-122.66208787878789,05,Spring

I live close enough to the airport and Kirtland Air Force Base that I am familiar with both common commercial and military aircraft, flight patterns, and speeds. I also spend many hours a week looking at the sky, the stars, and constellations, and frequently see satellites passing overhead. This was large, and brighter than a commercial jet normally appears at the distance as I perceived it, and it went much straighter up than jets I normally see. It moved more like a satellite, but it was slower, larger, and brighter than any satellite I have ever observed, plus, when I opened the Stellarium app on my phone, it did not indicate any object passing overhead at that time. As I watched it and realized that it was not anything I am familiar with, it passed between the Alpha and Beta stars in Cassiopeia, and the light went out. It didn't fade or shoot off in any direction, it just stopped being visible, like a switch was flipped.

The shape was unlike any ufo I ever heard of.  It had a top,middle and bottom to it.  All the same width with the middle a bit larger in highth then the top and bottom.  The top and bottom were the same sizes. middle section was like the saucer shapes you here of, but there were like half saucers on top and bottom of it.  Seemed flat on top and bottom.

I have always had a habit of watching the skies at night.  The best sightings I had were when I lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico.  My boyfriend and I were walking into the mall on night and I noticed an unusual light in the sky and we decided when we left the mall if it was still there we would go look for it.  When we came out it was still there but had moved slightly.  So we drove up to Hyde Park where the lookout spot is and could see a disk like object hovering above Santa Fe. 
 
The sightings I am reporting now are above Taneytown, MD.  I have not lived here long but since I have moved here I have been noticing different things.  Last winter I saw a falling object over a local park, it was too large to be a falling star.  I have noticed an object that travels parallel with a main road- the lighted object moves so slow it is almost not noticeable it is moving unless you are actually watching it. 
 
I have also noticed that around 9pm there is a light in the sky behind where we live.  To give an idea of the diameter; stars vs. ""the light""   it is like the stars are pin-heads and “the light” is a pencil eraser.  The light is not directly above me when I see it; it is off in the distance a bit. To show attempt to express the distance it travels within an amount of time; if you were to go on my back porch with a ruler and hold it up, the bottom of the ruler lined up with the roof top of the house-- the light starts out about 12 inches above the house diagonally behind us, then by 10pm the light is level with the chimney top of the same house.  Not sure how else to explain it.  The light is not directly above the house it is off in a distance.  Just using perspective to explain how it moves.  Also it does not move in a straight line – it slowly zigzags as it moves forward.  My friend and I went looking for it the other night but it was slightly cloudy out and lost it.  We a! re going to attempt it again on another night.  This light is out there every night – but I have not noticed it on rainy nights because I don’t go out there when it is raining. 
 
Earlier tonight I saw something in my peripheral vision above me out front.  It was a very large green glow shooting across the sky.  It was round in the front and it definitely was not a shooting star, if I would have held my fist in the air it would have been bigger than my fist. And it disappeared right after I looked up.",39.6688,-77.1723,06,Summer

Monday Jan 31 appx 6:50pm cst with clear skies. I walked outside and looked into the sky. To the North I noticed a point of white light high in the sky moving to the SSW. I assumed it was a satellite as I could not detect any flashing lights. I see lots of satellites. The only reason I took notice is that it seemed to be passing through a haze, like a fog or a wispy cloud. All of the other stars in the sky were crisp and clear. I thought that the “cloud” must be a rogue and the satellite would quickly pass through it and become “crisp and clear” as well. 
I was facing to the west and the object was high in the sky (maybe 15-20 degrees west of my zenith) and passed from my right to my left. It never escaped the haze. In fact as it got more overhead I could see that the “cloud” was in the form of a spiral around the object, a two-armed spiral with each arm curling away from the object on opposite sides. From end to end it took up maybe 20 degrees of the sky.The spiral cloud was not very thick but was definitely noticeable and undeniably in a spiral shape. The spiral cloud did NOT seem to be rotating in any way. It just moved along with the object. And if not for the hazy spiral the object and my sighting of it would have been nothing out of the ordinary. The object and the haze around it continued on it’s path until it moved into the city glow on my SSW horizon.

My boyfriend and I took the pontoon boat out on the lake to enjoy the sunset, as we often do. 
 
It was a fabulous sunset and we stayed to watch all the beautiful after glow.  The stars started coming out and the sky cleared.  We were picking out constellations when I saw a star shoot across the sky.  Then I saw another one.  My boyfriend started seeing stars shooting all over the sky.  He recalls seeing 30 to 40 of them at a time.  I remember seeing 10 or 12 at a time.  We were amazed and thrilled at the sight.  I was so happy because, even though I have spent hundreds of nights sleeping out under the open sky, I had never seen a UFO.  We could hear, but not see one lone jet flying round the area. 
 
Then, about 1000 feet of the stern of the boat, we saw looked like a huge (300' across?) plane shaped object bearing down on us about 100 feet off the water.  It had very bright yellow orange lights.  A big one in the center and decreasingly smaller lights going out the ends of the object.  It was speeding and descending directly at us.  Totally silent.   My boyfriend got a very short video but it is not very good.  I can't believe that I was laughing!  But it is on the video.  Then it just disappeared into thin air.  Poof!  It was gone.  It seems strange, but neither one of us seemed to be frightened at all.   It was all just so awesome and thrilling. 
 
 We decided to stay out and keep star gazing.  About 15 minutes passed then an object just like the first one, but about twice as large, started to bare down on us.  Same as the first but more lights.  It too just disappeared.  We stayed out another half hour, then decided to go home.  I hesitate to tell the following, because it makes my account seem unbelievable, but I want to report it all. 
 
 As we were stepping of the pontoon boat, from my boyfriends phone in his pocket we heard a computerized female voice saying random numbers and letters.  Something like: M R 5 V 8 M K 3 Y R B 2.  The phone had not rung.  And there is no record of it on his phone. 
 
 We went home and went to sleep like nothing had happened. 
 
 The next morning I couldn't stop thinking about it, and I thought it was very odd that I wasn't freaking out.  It was like I had seen a fabulous movie or gone on really wild carnival ride.  I didn't take my shower till noon because I had yard work to do in the morning.  When I went to blow dry my hair, I looked at my eyes in the mirror and I saw terror looking back at me.  And that freaked me out.  I am thinking that my conscious mind is protecting me from going crazy.  But my subconscious knows. 
 
 Days passed and the thought occurred to me that those huge objects created no waves on our shallow lake.  Normally even a small fishing boat will far away will create waves.  I'm thinking that those objects were holograms.  My boyfriend thinks that they were real because hovercrafts don't make a wake.  I just don't know.

At about 23:30 on May 31, 2014, I was sitting on a couch in a dark room watching a fire in the fireplace; I happened to glance through a window (located on the north side of the condominium) up into the dark night sky (there was little moonlight outside,  I believe we had a waxing crescent moon) at about a 45° angle. 
 
I noticed three dark orange spheres out in the distance come into view; they were descending, traveling southward in a fairly straight-line formation toward me from a northwardly direction.  The three spheres were spaced about the same distance apart as they descended toward me.  As they descended they appeared to begin a slow sweeping arch toward a southwest direction.   
 
After about 15 seconds the second (center) sphere appeared to release three small (pin-size) spheres from directly beneath it; all three spheres fell equal distance apart for 3–5 seconds prior to totally, instantly, disappearing. 
 
The three dark orange spheres—each appearing to be slightly larger than a pencil eraser—continued their slow, sweeping southwestward descent.  As the three spheres were beginning to level off while continuing to turn (and while they were just barely north of my position) I stepped out onto the deck to get a better view.  The distance between the three spheres appeared to expand. As the sphere in front started to move in a more westward direction and began to gain altitude the middle sphere released three additional small (pin-size) spheres from directly beneath it; all three of these spheres also fell equal distance apart for 3–5 seconds prior to totally, instantly disappearing. 
 
The lead sphere began to pull away from the other two as it gained altitude as it traveled in a westward direction; the second (middle) sphere also began to gain attitude as it traveled in a westward direction.  The third (and last) sphere appeared to slow as it gained altitude while also traveling in a westward direction away from Traverse City.  I watched the three spheres until they were completely out of sight…gaining altitude as they continued traveling in a westward direction. 
 
The three spheres appeared to be fairly far away from my location; I would estimate they never got closer than Grand Traverse Bay and remained beyond the Peninsula while making their sweep from the northwardly to the westward direction. 
 
The spheres appeared to glow.  They did not have discrete/separate lights or lights that pulsated; I did not hear any type of noise come from the spheres. 
 
I observed the three main spheres for approximately two minutes.  The two sets of spheres that fell from beneath the second (center) sphere instantly disappeared after 3–5 seconds.",44.71860971428572,-85.6604109010989,05,Spring

It was not a color typically produced by electric lights or LED's. At first I thought it was Mars, but it was too bright and it was moving. About an inch behind it (from my perception) there was an intermittent white flash - a tiny light the size of a satellite, but following the orange light. As the orange light rose, it began to fade and eventually disappeared, as did the white light. I also caught a red light of the same size as the white light flash only once. This was a standard aviation/LED red and could have been an aircraft.

I was leaving my fiance’s house around 11:30 PM on the 22nd of May, 2011.  His house is essentially in the middle of nowhere and is surrounded by corn fields.   
 
On a clear night, you can see every star in the pitch black sky, as it is void of air pollution and smog.  Tonight, however, we are expecting serious storm systems so the sky was extremely cloudy and overcast.  Dark grey clouds blocked any stars or airplanes in the sky.   
 
However, looking to the eastern part of the sky, I noticed a vibrantly glowing orange light hovering in the air.  Having avid interest in UFOs, I pointed it out to my fiance, asking him if there was a streetlight or radio tower in that area.   
 
He quickly brushed off these possibilities, as his house is surrounded by farmland as I mentioned.   
 
We stood staring at the UFO.  It hung stationary in the sky, glowing a bright orange.  It didn’t waver like an airplane- in fact, it didn’t move whatsoever.  The object was VERY still.  It seemed to flash a li! ttle bit of red in the lower right corner.    
 
For the most part, it was entirely orange- a very vibrant orange.  The UFO captivated us since it stood out so sharply against the cloud-covered sky.  I cannot emphasize this enough.  [I took careful note on my drive home- I couldn’t even see any airplanes against the heavy cloud coverage.]  
 
After about 2 minutes of observation, the orange object began to get smaller and smaller before it disappeared.",41.2535,-87.8474,05,Spring

There was no plane shape near, I could also see a strange Ora or force around the flashing lights as it gradually and steadily moved forward from the lower left middle ! of the horizon at about a 45 degree angle up and across horizontally  towards the  upper right. at first I thought this was a trick of the eye, but as I continued to look, I could clearly see a surrounding area of the sky that was moving with the light, and had a very very slight difference in appearance than the rest of the sky. It was almost like a perfect camouflage with the night sky, it only could be detected with keen attention being paid to a seemingly average airplane in the sky. I observed about 20-30, maybe even 40 objects in the sky within the next 2 hours. I saw multiple shapes. Some were very small and had a similar shape to a blimp, except more rounded and less ovular. I saw large roundish saucer shapes. I saw one that has abrupt square edges. All of there are the shapes of the outer ""force"" or Ora around the flashing light. These obects were following each other in the sky. One would be far away and appear as a single light in the lower left distance. A mediu! m sized flashing light would we moving horizontally across fro! m left t o right at about the middle of my line of vision. This medium one was clearly made up of more than one blue and red flashing light. The third flying thing would be towards the upper right on the horizon. you could see the outlining force around it once it reached this point. Also I heard a low humming noise, similar to the sound of a car in neutral except more quiet and muffled. This appearance of one after the other lasted for about 30 minutes. I probably had seen about 20 objects during that time. After 2 hours of watching, I went inside. I peeked out the window several times and have spotted flashing lights at least once every time. Also, A friend from the far end of the neighborhood confirmed the sighting of three bright white lights in triangular form. Another friend in a further neighborhood confirmed the sighting of multiple objects in the sky at once. Several of the objects seen were clearly visible aircrafts but many others with not. I attempted to mkae video footag! e, but my cell phone camera's quality was too poor to capture the lights in the dark.",33.96784209078404,-84.02268390646492,01,Winter

Craft had a base that was about two feet thick. The two lights (like spot lights) were mounted on the base which was a dark brown color. The top of the craft had ""bell curve"" shape to it.

There was a ""haze"" around the left side of the craft. The right side of the craft, which was facing the setting sun, was perfectly clear. No haze. 
Stared at the craft for two minutes. I took my eyes off the craft just for a split second. When I looked back at it, it was gone.

While sitting in my backyard talking on the phone in the evening staring at the sky and mentioning a random satellite I would see from time to time, I then saw another “ satellite” moving but quickly noticed there were 2 other “satellites” moving with it and all 3 made up a massive triangle shape. 
 
I know the gov and nasa has satellites that are designed to fly “linked” or “tethered” by nothing more than a laser to maintain a specific distance between them (usually a few kilometers) for calculating objects while they scan the surface of earth (or whatever they orbit) however I’ve never heard of 3 satellites using the same method flying in a delta v or a triangle…. The tips of this triangle were not even close to each other but rather so far apart the distance would probably be the size of Massachusetts given how large it was in the sky…. I saw it for about 30 seconds before the 3 points of light just disappeared …. And for hrs I was thinking it was 3 “individual objects” flying synchronized but then it dawned on me what if it was one massive triangle object and these were the 3 points and then I was like holy shit that could be a single massive ship…. Because that correlates with objects that have been described on the west cost since the early 90’s. The points of the triangle were so large… imagine looking up at the night sky and holding a basketball in your outstretched arms and the points were outside that basketball (approximately) … That projected angle is so massive in miles I can’t imagine the size of it based on the altitude it was at.

The strange thing is me and my boyfriend were in a cemetery taking snapshots trying to catch anything “creepy” just for fun.  We parked on one of the cemetery roads and my boyfriend says “look at those helicopters”  We got out of the car to see what we thought were five helicopters flying up and at an angle in the sky.  Almost at the same time we realized they all looked like they were on fire.  I pulled out my camera and video taped it immediately.  When we cam home I googled what UFO sightings look like because we weren’t sure.  The first video we pulled up was the same exact thing we had seen but it was in Scotland two nights prior.  I would really like to know what it is we saw. I dont know how to send the video it is too large.  We have proof.  The link to the Scotland sighting is:

In the early morning of Friday, April 5, 2019, appx. 1:00 am, I awakened to something in my bedroom with my husband, sound asleep, and my 2 dogs, asleep in the bathroom.  This orb of bright white light, had eyes, a slit that represented a mouth, was approx. 18 inches from my face.  It “illuminated” my face, as it seemed to assess me while I was trying to assess it. 
 
I remember thinking, did someone break into our house and is in the bedroom?  The door was closed and this orb did not have a body, nor did I see any hair . 
 
It appeared to have somewhat of a face; the eyes were staring through me, and was not a friendly gaze. 
 
I remember being frightened; however, could not break my gaze. 
 
Then it disappeared. 
 
The encounter was a matter of seconds, approxx. 10-20 seconds. 
 
This past week, I have been trying to understand what I saw and recount the details.  It has been haunting.  For a few  nights, I was afraid to go to sleep.  At first, I thought it could be a visit from a spirit(?); however, it wasn’t a familiar sight. 
 
It wasn’t until I heard on the news, there were strange parallel lines in the sky above Los Angeles, the next day, April 6, that I believed it could have been an entity encounter. 
 
To clarify my personality,  I am a 63 year young woman , married for 34 years , no children , just my beautiful dogs.  I am of sound mind, very grounded always level headed.

On this night I was out looking at Orion's Belt, or what I think it was.  There were only say 3 stars in a row on the horizon of the night sky in Lovettsville, VA.  I looked to the left of Orion's Belt, I saw a blinking red, blue, green light in the sky to the west around 250 to 275 degree.   
 
The object was clearly moving like a bee to a flower.  That is how it was moving I went ahead and recorded it on my phone.  The video was held steady and the object was still moving.   
 
I know it was part of the night sky cause I looked out about an hour later and it had stayed in the same place but moved with the night sky.   
 
I am just curious to know what it was on that night that I saw.   
 
Can anyone offer anything realistic of a solution?

My wife and myself were driving E on US 40 just passing downtown Cambridge City when we noticed a large triangular (?) shape craft flying very low in airspace that doesn't make sense.  What I mean is, it at first resembled a commercial airplane considering the size and formation of lights, but it was flying at a height just barely above the trees/power lines and housetops, flying N/NW.  There were 2 white lights where wings of a jet or plane might be, and one red light at the tail that was flashing (hence, forming a triangle).   
 
I know this sounds like a commercial airplane, but there's no way that this ""plane"" would have been flying so low and without sound to boot.  After noticing these anomalies, we began to chase after it, heading N on Graham Street and E on Delaware to jog over to SR-1 N.   
 
As we headed N on SR-1 and could still see the object for a few minutes, this time flying NE/N, until it was gone above the industrial park just south of the! SR-1/I-70 Interchange.  Looking back on the event, and even though this sighting happened after dark, my wife believes that the object looked, most-likely, that it was in fact 1 or 2 separate objects (accounting for both of the white lights) with the red-lit flashing object in tow.  I couldn't necessarily say that I saw anything between the lights, and she's not saying that she could either, but that made more sense to her senses and what she was actually seeing than it being 1 solid craft.  Again, this is a densely-populated area that would not have seen a commercial-sized aircraft this low EVER - but that was precisely the size of it.  Finally, the lights, while appearing not dissimilar in color and size to that of a plane, had an odd, square-shapedness about them.  I have only seen 2 objects in my life that have made me scratch my head and I look up a lot.  It should be noted that my previous sighting (which I did report to NUFORC with the date of 8/15/02) overlapped with this sighting at the location of Graham St./Delaware St.   Meaning th at the object we witnessed last night passed over nearly the EXACT airspace of my only other previous sighting of a shiny spherical UFO.",39.8212,-85.1715,01,Winter

We've been by the woods and shined lights in them and saw somethings eyes that reflected red but we couldn't see the creature. It a closer every time we looked back.

PLEASE READ CAREFULLY, I WAS AS BREIF AS I COULD BE BUT JUST PLEASE LISTEN THAT I WOULD NEVER LIE ABOUT SUCH A THING BECAUSE I TAKE THESE THINGS VERY SERIOUSLY!!!   
 
It was just after sundown and my brother and I were smoking by the poolhouse in our backyard which we have a very clear and brief veiw of the sky from.Just for plot and setting of this sighting I live right next to the only airport in portland and i know planes and military and helicopters, jets etc. 
 
I noticed my stepfather staring in the sky and i had a very weird feeling in my gut that just hit me when i saw my stepfater. 
 
I asked him what he was doing and he stated that he heard on the radio that a man has spotted several strange lights and activity goin on and that he saw something strange a night before and that he has a weird feeling which was similiar to mine. 
 
First we saw a strange and solid, small but fast object with no light and it circled the region of the sky and disappeared. 
 
Two more objects just like the first object came from the same direction and in my own perspective they (floated) but flew the same direction and vanished as well. 
 
As my stepfather and brother were trying to make out what they were or are which in their words were (drone) like objects, I spotted a flash in the corner of my left eye and a star like object with a bright light not blinking came from the direction the (drones) were last seen and the star object was moving rapidly in a curve like direction going south and cleared the sky from were it was spotted to the southside in a matter of seconds and then and i pointed it out to my stepfather saying""hey what is that look it is moving so fast what is it"". 
 
The light made the object look like a star but no star can move so fast and out of place.It was so far but so close that we should have heard a sound like planes make or jets but it was dead silent. 
 
A flash of light came from the star like object and it vanished in the opposite direction from the (drones). 
 
As we were baffled at what we just saw and somewhat speechless, the (drone) objects came back from the direction they left and were moving not as fast but rapidly towards the direction of the star like object but the star was nowhere to be seen again. 
 
I waited for 30 mins to try and see something again but nomore activity came besides the normal of living next to the airport. 
 
I believe in ufos and aliens or beings or what have you but i would never think of seeing something as strange as i saw and having the feeling that my stepfather and i felt when it happened. 
 
I watch alot of history and tv and am a huge fan of ancient aliens and shows of that sort but really just the theory of existence in our galaxy but i think the hoaxes and fake reports are stupid because i thought i would never live to see something unusual but i have and i know for a fact that it was real and was getting away from whatever was chasing it and succeeded substentaly. 
 
It was the fastest thing i have ever seen in the sky and i know planes and military jets planes etc. 
 
The star object was not from this world and i have strange feeling something is happening or is goin to happen soon i don""t know what or when but i hope someone listens to me because there is too much activity going on in my city. 
 
I have lived in the same city for twenty two years and have never seen anything like what i say and i am trying to peice together what was going on or happened and what i saw but i know 100% that it was a ufo sighting. 
 
I may not have photo or video evidence but i know what i saw was real and i would never lie about these things because it is very important to me im a fan not a player.

I noticed a dim solid white light, appearing very much like a satellite, travelling west to east, speed very similar to that of a satellite or the space station.

This second light, traveling slightly higher and at the same speed, was the same size and intensity but over a 5 second span it would fade into view and then fade out completely. This repeated at a uniform rate until they both disappeared near the tree line near the horizon.

Good evening, After some consideration, I have decided to report an incident that occurred on the night of 12/21/2019.  I am a 737 Captain at a major US airline.  In 21 years of flying with an air carrier I have never seen something that I couldn’t explain in one way or another. This event is my first exception. 
 
 Unfortunately, my times and locations for this event are not exact. The First Officer (FO) and I were so taken with what was occurring, discussing what it might have been, that I did not note this information to the degree that I should have.  I did take a screen shot of my computer flight plan later in the flight.  Time and location have largely been rebuilt using this data and the mutual recollection of myself and the FO. 
 
We were about 2.3 hours in to our flight from JFK to SFO, cruising at 32,000 feet, Mach .79, on a magnetic course of approximately 270.  The time was about 1950 central time (0150Z) and we were roughly 50-100 nautical miles north of Kansas City.  The sky was very clear.  The cockpit overhead light was turned off, but both the FO and I had our map lights on as we ate our crew meals.  My point in describing this is to illustrate the moderate amount of light pollution within the cockpit rendering only the brighter stars visible. 
 
While eating dinner, I noticed 5 white lights in the night sky that I initially took to be stars. They were centered within a few degrees of the nose of our aircraft.  These 5 “stars” were in an exact diagonal line at approximately a 30 degree angle of tilt relative to the horizon. I would say their distance apart was about the same as the spacing in Orion’s belt. They were approximately 10 to 15 degrees above the horizon.  The lowest “star” was on the left, and the highest was on the right.  When first observed, they were all the same “medium” relative intensity to other stars.  They had zero relative motion with respect to the other stars in the area. What struck me was the linear nature of their formation.  I decided to have a look at my iPad star chart after I finished eating and continued to watch the 5 lights. 
 
After about 5 minutes, my FO commented, “Do you see those 5 stars out there?”.  The comment was unsolicited. It had struck her as peculiar too.  We agreed that we had never seen that star formation in the sky.  We put our food away, turned off our interior lights and began watching intently for the next 15 to 20 minutes.  During that time period, the light in the middle of the row of five flared twice to a very bright intensity.  I would liken it to an Iridium flare. The remaining four did not change in intensity.  Towards the end of the time period, the two pairs of lights on either side of the center light quickly faded and were no longer visible.  Approximately 10-20 seconds after the outer pairs of lights faded, the center light flared slightly and began moving diagonally up and to the right in our field of view at about a 30 degree angle.  It moved at about half of the pace normally observed when viewing the ISS. The movement lasted for less than 10 seconds before it also faded! in intensity until no longer visible.  This final light faded in a way similar to when a satellite enters the Earth’s shadow and no longer reflects light in the direction of the observer. 
 
That was the end of it. Not too flashy, and certainly no threat of ever going down in history as significant.  I just felt compelled to share the experience since it was so out of the ordinary for me. 
 
The FO and I discussed various hypotheses about the lights in the aftermath.  There is no way it was an aircraft.  The extended period of zero relative motion to the background and unwavering uniformity of the formation rules it out unequivocally.  It was not naturally occurring.  The geometry of the formation indicates something man made, or other.  My perception of the flaring indicates reflection of sunlight rather than a light bulb of some sort.  These were not objects using aerodynamics.  I believe they were in space, but did not behave like a craft in orbit unless that orbit was geosynchronous. 
 
There is probably a good explanation for this, but I have no idea what that explanation might be.  I would very much appreciate any insight you may have based on your experience.  I am hoping that perhaps you have a deeper knowledge regarding near Earth orbital operations being conducted that may explain what I saw.  I’m also hoping someone else saw it and reported the same event. 
 
Thank you for your time.",39.09501080851064,-94.56549749787231,12,Winter

To whom it may concern,  This is my account of what my daughter and I saw on the night of November 19th, 2013.  My daughter has filed her own report, per instructions of Mr. Davenport. 
 
Approximately 5:55pm, my daughter and I decided to go the store, and as we turned onto the next block to leave, heading north, we spotted two solid blue lights, evenly spaced about 200ft apart, right in front of our view, but about a mile away.  There was a red flashing light next to one of the blue solid lights.   
 
The craft was moving very slowly to the north/northeast.  We figured it may be a normal aircraft, although we have never seen a craft, other than a helicopter, move that slow, so we ignored it and continued to the store.  
 
On our way home from the store, approximately 6:48pm, I was looking out the car window, when I saw three green lights, triangular in shape, suspended about 300-350ft off the ground, staying in the same spot, again with one red flashing light next to one of the green lights.  It was just outside the window on the west side of the road.   
 
I told my daughter to take the next road to the right, which has no lights, and when she asked why, I pointed to the lights.  She pulled over and I rolled the window down to take a video with my phone.    
 
My daughter gave me her iphone, and I started to record.  Shortly after starting the recording, the object started to move away at a very slow speed, heading north/northeast. It started to move a little faster, but never just took off at a high rate of speed.  I recorded it until I couldn't see it on her phone any longer, at which time, we left and went home.   
 
I have been completely dumbfounded since seeing it, and must say that I am still not sure what I saw, but I've never seen anything of this shape, with the ability to stay in one place, with absolutely no sound coming from it.   
 
We have sent the video I took to Mr. Davenport, with ufo video by barnard as the subject, using the director@ufocenter.com address.

I sighted an unidentified moving object from the shore of Ocean Beach San Diego California at about 2 pm October 27 2017.  Duration of sighting was between 5 and 10 minutes. 
 
On this day the weather was very hot and dry as Santa Ana weather condition gave way to clear unlimited visibility and a cloudless bright blue sky.  I was laying on my back on the sandy beach so naturally I was looking skyward.  My feet were pointed straight to the surf so my body was aligned northwesterly looking out to sea.  The sun was about 40 degrees to my left. 
 
As I watched an airliner pass by at mid altitude (approx. 10,000 feet) I noticed it pass by a small white spot in the sky.  The spot was roundish, stationary, and had the washed out white color the moon has on a sunny day.  This led me to think I was looking at Venus or some other celestial object though I was skeptical as I have never seen any celestial object in the bright day sky other than the moon. 
 
For the next several minutes I stared at the spot for a short while and then looked away for a moment and looked back up again still puzzled at what I was looking at.  After looking away, relocating it took a few moments as the small spot was difficult to see against the bright blue sky so I pointed straight at it so I could better relocate it.  From a perpendicular skyward view I pointed about 20 degrees to my right and about 20 degrees forward. 
 
Again I looked away for a short while and looked back up to relocate the spot, but I did not see it.  I pointed my finger in the direction I had just pointed a moment ago but the spot was gone.  I scanned the sky for a few seconds and I relocated the spot.  The spot had moved about 15 degrees to my left and was stationary.  Now my attention was peaked. I could rule out Venus or any other celestial object.  I stared intently at the spot for about 10 or 15 seconds when suddenly it appeared to move very slightly in a circular motion.  The movement was hard to tell against the bright blue sky so I extended and steadied my left hand and finger to try and gauge movement.  In the next few seconds I confirmed the spot was moving slightly in a circular motion, grew in brightness, then dimmed and vanished.  End of story. 
 
As an observer of credibility I want to note that I am a middle aged adult with fine far vision (no glasses). I had sunglasses and viewed the object with and without my sun glasses. I was not under the influence of any drug, alcohol, or medication.  Since childhood I have been an avid sky watcher.  I am sure what I saw that day was not of this Earth.

Boomeranged/stealth bomber shape, silent, no lights or sound   Back in the summer of 2010, late evening, I was outside having a smoke on a patio chair. I slowly tilted my head back to look at the night sky and if I had not, I would have completely missed it.  I still have a hard time trying to estimate its size when I think of it. 
 
It was flying very low and was massive (about 4 football fields in length or larger) directly overhead. It made no sound or lights, blending with the night sky. The first thing that came to mind when I saw the shape was a stealth bomber but as I studied it, the two bottom corners were rounded like a boomerang and it came in on the back to a flat edge (not full triangle). The coloring is hard to describe. I had to stare really hard to make out what looked like a camo pixel design of dark greys and blacks, but not painted, more like each color was a separate panel. 
 
It was flying fast enough that this only lasted about 30 seconds (despite its size) before disappearing into the dark after passing overhead. During the entire time I had not moved and felt like almost numb as I watched it. 
 
I have searched UFO sightings and military planes but nothing comes close to what I witnessed in shape and size for ones posted online are either a complete pointy triangle shape or skinny boomerang shape. 
 
I am posting it now because of another recent UFO sighting (not the same type unfortunately) has increased my interested in this phenomenon. 
 
I would love to discuss this with someone who has had the same sighting.

I am sorry that I just found your website. 
 
I stumbled across your site after a simple Google Search of:  ""5 Triangular Shapes in the Sky"". 
 
I have been alarmed about what I saw flying over my house a few years ago. 
 
I am a U.S. Navy Veteran, thus I KNOW high speed aircraft and, what I saw were NO Aircraft!  I was outside in my driveway in roughly 2011 (forgive me as it has been a couple of years so I do not exactly remember the year, since I didn't lend much credence to it at the time), but, I happened to look up in the sky and saw 3 different 6-triangle shaped lights moving VERY FAST across the sky.  There were NO Red & Green lights that would indicate any aircraft.  I live near an airport so I am used to seeing airplanes flying either overhead or very near my sightline.  These were simply white lights.  These lights were moving so fast that I literally didn't have enough time to grab my cell phone to record them moving.  There are NO aircraft that move THAT FAST! ,  Plus, I have seen the pictures of the SAME lights that I saw, but, what I saw, there was a group of 2 sets of those lights that over-lapped each other.  Meaning, and looking up and moving West to East, and number the lights from front to back, and left to right, 1 first row, 2-3 second row, 4-5-6 third row, when you see the first set of 6 lights, the second 6-set of lights were in synch, but,  the 2nd row of lights (light #2) overlapped the original 3rd set of lights at light number 6.  Then the last set of 6 lights followed behind. 
 
Again, these lights were moving way to fast to be ANY aircraft!  I have been trying to find something like I saw and your website has EXACTLY what I saw, but not in the cluster that I saw flying over my house. 
 
I wanted to try to find out if there was a ""fighter squadron"" flying overhead at that time but, there would be NO reason why a ""fighter squadron"" would be flying over this location at that time of night, and flying faster than the speed of sound, which is the ONLY way ANY objects could be flying that fast. Plus I had no idea HOW to investigate this. Thus, I just keep this to myself until I saw the images on your website. I hope that someone has an explanation to what I saw.

I am reporting this because I heard on Coast to Coast AM that these types of sighting have been growing and you would like any reports.   
 
This happened in a very rural area outside of Durango, no lights other than farm houses on the horizon and a very clear night.  My fiancé and I were driving home down a long stretch of dirt road and noticed three amber/orange light at about a 45 degree angle from us.  The three light were angled at a 45 degree angle as well diagonally.   
 
We initially thought it was a crane or something, and were utterly confused as it was a rural area.   
 
As we got closer the light began to move horizontally.  We then watched the light from our front porch.  They were hovering over where a small mountain was (with nothing on top).  They would shoot back and forth across the sky and at one point one converged with another and then shot out so fast it made me jump back in reaction.   
 
There were approx. 6 lights at the most, 3 more than what we originally saw.  If I remember right, after about an hour we had to go to bed so we never saw them disappear.  I just with I could have filmed this, because it was so bazaar.   
 
Also, we could hear ""hovering""-almost a buzzing sound.   
 
This was our first ever sighting and very freaky!   
 
As a side note, one of my really good friends posted on a facebook almost the exact same experience and sighting, (only about 120 miles- in Arizona) away from our sighting about a week later.  I thought this could not be a coincidence!

While stargazing app. 12:30CT early Monday morning, 10/4/2010, I sighted a low- flying aircraft that I could not identify. 
 
I was in the back parking lot of an apartment complex in a south-western Birmingham suburb, near the top of the tallest hill in the area (which slopes northwards,) stargazing.  No one was about and there was little to no air traffic at that time.  It was a moonless night I was watching Taurus rise in the eastern sky.  Out of the corner of my eye and towards my left field of vision, I noticed a large optical blur- like a wave effect- directly over the constellation Cassiopeia.  A triangular or, perhaps, wide wedge shaped object seemed to materialize into existence at that point against the star field.  The exact shape was difficult to ascertain, because my eyes were dazzled by an absolute matte blackness which seemed to cloak the thing and travel with it, and was profound and visually confounding; but I was able to discern that it was roughly triangular in shape. 
 
Each of its three blunt or rounded corners was steadily illuminated, but these stripes of luminosity did not seem mechanical.  Rather, they appeared dim and phosphorescent, of a sickly yellow-green hue, reminiscent of a weak glow-stick. 
 
The object first appeared roughly 50- 60 degrees above the horizon, north-north-east, at an altitude of approximately 300- 400 feet, headed due south, skirted the Pleiades to the west, and passed almost over my head and behind the top of the hill.  Its initial flight-path was slow and deliberate, like a helicopter or a glider.  It could not have been either one of these vehicles, though, because it was absolutely silent and was traveling almost against the wind.  It was much too slow for a prop plane or, especially, a jet.  I will reiterate: the thing was silent as death.  I estimate its diameter (point to point) to have been about 20- 30 feet.  This first sighting lasted 8- 10 seconds. 
 
It is perhaps irrelevant, but noteworthy, that within 10 seconds after this sighting I witnessed a brilliant white falling star in the east, very near on the horizon, directly behind what was the object’s flight- path. 
 
About three minutes later, it (I assume it was the same object) proceeded back the way it came- this time at a much higher altitude and at an impossibly high speed.  Had I not still been scrutinizing the sky, or had I even blinked, I would have missed it.  This second time it was only recognizable as a distant black point of mass that blanked out the highest stars as it passed.  Any object traveling at that speed should have (according to my understanding of Newtonian physics) produced a sonic boom, but it was, again, completely silent. 
 
I will add a final, perhaps irrelevant, detail.  For sake of a complete record I state here that I have never in my life felt such a prescient sense of dread and malevolence as I did while witnessing this object and after the fact.  I soon departed the area.  Since that time, I have been plagued with vicious nightmares and a disrupted sleeping pattern.",33.481415080191624,-86.79047456779837,10,Fall

I was outside around 9 pm taking care of dog duties. I looked up in the western sky and was noticing the big dipper and Arcturus when movement in the sky just left of Arcturus caught my attention.  It was a small, dim, white, semi-transparent, trapezoid shaped object that moved quickly across the sky from the west to the southeast in about 5 seconds.  The object faded off into the distance as I lost sight of it. 
 
 The shape of the object was a trapezoid.  The long sides were oriented vertical, with the longest side being the leading edge of the object.  The leading edge appeared brighter than the rest of the object.  The object was dimly lit, about as bright as an average star.  The color was mottled white, whereby the surface of the object appeared to faintly sparkle or twinkle (similar to the twinkling of stars) randomly across the object, giving it a mottled or semi-transparent appearance. 
 
It had no other colors or fixed exterior lights and made no sound (as aircraft would). 
 
It was about 60 degrees above the horizon. 
 
Whatever it was, it was way out there and moved fast. It took about 5 seconds to go from a west to southeast direction.  It made a straight line path and maintained the same elevation across the sky. 
 
It left/had no trail. There were no aircraft in the sky at that time.  It was a clear night.",38.782562762762765,-90.73297267267267,08,Summer

It continued to hail until approximately 15:00.  I decided to take my dog out, was curious what he would think of the remaining hail on the ground, and nothing else seemed out of the ordinary at the time.   
 
Once my dog and I came back in I took a peak out the back-sliding glass door and the clouds with the sun looked really gorgeous.  So, I decided to take some pictures at 15:13 exactly.  I took 6 pictures facing West from my back yard before reviewing them with my LG V40 phone.  I saw this little black triangle and zoomed in the best I could and I started seeing it most the pictures.  At the time I could not see it as clearly on my phone, but it might be almost cone shaped, or rounded.  I thought maybe I would catch something else if I took more photos and videos afterwards at 15:15 and later but nothing else showed up.  I was curious to see if anyone else reported anything strange in the area or possibly was able to get a video or more evidence of what it was or could be.  I marked that there may have been 2 objects.  There is a green orb that definitely looked out of place, but I didn’t really notice it as much on my phone, more so on my computer monitor.  It definitely shows up in 3 of the pictures.  I know it is a phone camera but my phone actually has 3 different lenses in the back and one is a telescopic lens so the pictures are pretty decent.

The event occurred traveling northbound on interstate 287 between Basking Ridge and Morristown.  Visibility was good at street level but the sky was opaque with low lying cloud cover.   
 
At approximate 7:30am EST, a dark triangle moved through my field of vision on a westerly trajectory, through the clouds, disturbing the cloud around it as it traveled like a hand through smoke. I could not get a definitive view as it was using the cloud cover.  All that was visible was its triangular shape and that it was black or very dark grey.  It was silent, had no lights and was moving at a fast rate of speed.  Viewing lasted for about 4 seconds.  My best estimate is that the object was about a half a mile downrange and maybe 200-300 feet above the ground,  Just high enough to use the cloud cover.  Considering the distance and size of the object in my field of view my best guess is that it was about 100' from edge to edge.

I landed my eye on that streak so I would have a point of reference and saw these 2 lights that were definitely above the airplane streak move.

I then spotted a third one moving toward the airplane streak, but it did not pass it. Those 3 lights lined up in a straight line.   
 
 After spotting those, I tried to look for others, and thought I saw things moving, but the streak had faded, so I didn't know if my eyes were playing tricks on me.

Tonight (May 1st, 2014) I had friends over.  After they all left and I straightened up a bit, I stepped outside onto my deck.  My neighbor moved out of her house yesterday so I was curious to see if there were any lights on in the back of the house which would indicate that the new neighbors were there.  (It was between 10:33 and 10:35 PM).   
 
I look up and passing over my house there is a bright round orange orb/light.  This night is cloudy so perhaps the object was distorted?  BUT as crazy as this might sound, it looked like it had something attached to the backside of it (as I viewed it going past my line of vision).  The something looks like an orange transparent sack/bubble; like the UFO/ORB was pulling or dragging it.   
 
I ran inside the house to call my kids but decided it was too late THEN went back outside only to see another one passing over my house.  This time I did call my daughter-in-law on the cordless phone.  She went outside but was not able to see it.  
 
The first one to pass over my house looked like something was attached but the second one did not.  Both are a glowing orange.  The first one was so bright I thought it was going to crash and that the appendage was actually fire.  Apparently, I was wrong since I watched it move out view.    
 
Both were silent and moved at the same speed as an airplane.  I would say they were airplanes distorted by cloud coverage BUT they were such a bright burning orange, completely silent and with orange being the only visible color...  There might have been one before I stepped outside but missed it.  Tonight their direction went from WEST to EAST (both of them).",38.62698880773583,-90.30702881390803,05,Spring

My friend and I were swimming at night and having a good time, while my dad was on the steps of my back porch, trying to replace a step.  We were talking, being slightly loud.  I looked behind some trees, over a few houses and saw two extremely bright lights, in the shape of car headlights.   
 
For a few seconds, I brushed it off as an airplane type I had never seen before.  I calmly pointed at the aircraft, telling my friend to look.  When she turned around, the aircraft suddenly started moving to the right.  Not like a normal plane, it wasn't at a steady pace.  It looked like a car that was breaking down, but it was level to where it was before.  Then it started moving faster and faster to the right.  I screamed and told my dad and friend to get inside.   
 
My friend and I struggled to get out of the pool, but I kept my eyes on the aircraft.  It turned to the side, the lights then faced away from me, and went behind some trees.  Two other lights, seemingly on the a! ircraft appeared.  They were purple and green, much smaller and nowhere near as bright as the lights before.  I waited for the aircraft to come out from the other side of the trees, but it didn't.  I kept a close eye on it.  My dad calmed us down, and we went back into the pool.   
 
Jets and planes fly over my house a lot, but this one had an unfamiliar route and was too close to the ground to be an airplane trying to land, there were no airports close enough.  Jets in my area have a square light  formation, of white, red, and sometimes yellowish lights.  Planes, however, with my airport, typically have red and/or blue lights.  Pretty much any lights besides green and purple.  Not to mention, the two brightest lights on planes typically are on the front, and are white.   
 
Yes, that matched the discription, but how exactly did the plane remain still, and move to the right when it's front was facing us?  If it was a plane, the lights on it's front would've been facing us, so I understand why it would appear still, but that doesn't really explain why it moved sideways, with no hesitation or normal movement of any other planes.   
 
Anyway, we were back in the pool.  Trying to have a good time, and ignore what we saw.  I kept a close eye on the spot between the trees the entire time.  I turned to talk to my friend, then spun back around and saw the lights again... in the exact same spot.  I screamed my friend's name as I rushed out of the pool.  The aircraft did the exact same thing once again.   
 
When I was talking to my dad about it, who was trying to convince me it wasn't a UFO, for my good night sleep's sake, I pointed behind him and there it was again.  It then, moved to the right, and disappeared behind the trees.   
 
I feel as if we were being spied on.  Every time I pointed at it, or started screaming, it left, then returned when I wasn't looking.  It's incredible, but I've been followed by too many things like this.  Also, no noise followed it.  It was completely quiet.",38.6976,-90.3604,08,Summer

Around mid-September, I took the dog out between 7p-8p again.  After the first occurrence, I am now in the habit of checking the sky when we go out because I wanted to see if this white square shape of lights that formed this perfectly circular shape appeared again, it did!!  I was unable to see anything but these perfect set of lights in this perfect circle again, it was too dark.  There may have been a haze or aura in the clouds, it was cloudy and dark.  This “object” did not do anything just hovered in this one spot again.  I only saw one. 
 
It was the same as what I reported in Mid-August, except this time, I didn’t put this together until I read your questions in my first report.  This time, as me and the dog went out, the apartment building lights were flickering on and off, the lights were fine a couple hours before.  I also noticed the next morning when I pulled into the park n ride just a few blocks away the lights were shorting in there as well. I just told myself that was a bit strange, must be something going on but it was interesting that the apartment building lights were having problems and then the park n ride lights were having the same problems, had an unsettling feeling about it.  I don’t know if there is a connection but you asked about electrical magnetic effects so thought I would mention this. 
 
A description of my background? I am just an average person, living an average life.  I work 8:15-5p every day at a law firm.  I am not one that has anything to do with UFO’s, it's creepy so I just don’t even dabble with it.  BUT after this, twice now, I am totally intrigued, a little creeped out and still extremely curious….to an extent.

I was driving home from work in Douglas going north toward Worcester when I saw 2 orange glowing objects in the sky.  At first I just thought they were planes but noticedthey were solid orange and didnt have the typical blinking lights of planes. 
 
I continued to observe them for a minute or so then lost them as I turned into my neighborhood.   
 
I pulled in my driveway and got out of my car looking for them and didn't see them at first but then noticed one in the sky followed shortly by 2 planes flying directly towards it from the southwest flying northeast towards it.   
 
At first the 2 planes were flying in parallel with one slightly behind but then the one behind fell in line directly behind the plane in the front.  They were clearly jets as they left the lines in the sky. 
 
The orange object rose into the any and then disappeared as the jets continued northeast towards Worcester. 
 
 I ran into my house shocked by what I just witnessed to get my wife and told her the story. I told her to come out and see the lines from the jets in the sky, upon going outside I pointed north to where we saw them and we saw 4 more round orange flowing balls rise above the treeline as if over Worcester and descending rapidly up into the sky only to disappear. 
 
 Both of us now shocked ran north across our front yard and noticed a neighbor out in his yard. We described to him what we had seen and at the same time we saw another one rise above the treeline and he witnessed it as well.

I seemed to not think anything about it because I was near Boeing, but then I heard it get louder, and closer.  By that time I knew it was not a plane because of the irregular, strange noises it was emitting.

Then I could faintly see four distinct lights apear out of the trees and then the sound just stoped.  There was a loud boom, but the boom was recognizable but I couldn't remember what the noise was.  Then it got too silent then it flew overhead, with a low hum then it was just gone.   
 
After it left I heard a dog bark a few times.  The ride to the beach from there was numbing just remembering what I saw but i would keep doubting myself until i rememberd what happend a few years ago.

About 2000 last night, my sister and I had just finished working and she called me outside to look at some strange lights in the sky to the west.  Over head we could see a group of little white lights blinking off and on.  To the left of the group was a larger orb that was glowing with blue light.  The group of lights started to move toward the north and the number of white light grew from approximately 20 to a couple hundred.  The group of white blinking lights appeared to follow the larger blue orb.

Around 5:30 this morning, my husband was out in the back yard with our dog, when he began to shout for me to come outside quickly. I worried something was wrong, so I immediately ran outside, as he pointed to the sky.   
 
About a mile away I saw a very prominent red circle or orb like craft.  There could have been a haze around it but unsure if it was my eyes or not.  The orb was definitive and red though.  I observed it and watched it  in the sky as it was hovering.   
 
Then, it very quickly zinged to the right and stopped again.  It turned from red to white, then back to red.  What I couldn't believe was the way it flew to the side and stopped immediately, not a gradual stop or eased stop, but a full on stop, like it hit a barrier and how fast it was moving.   
 
It hovered a minute, then zinged left stopped, and it appeared to gain some elevation as it slowly proceeded to fly to the right and out of view for a few seconds, when I caught a glimpse of it through the houses.   
 
I then observed it zing up into the sky so fast, I couldn't believe it, and it was gone.   
 
I am a well educated professional and I am telling you there is nothing I have ever seen or heard of that:  1.  Is as precise in stopping as that craft was, it defied physics;  2. Could move that fast, and still maintain such control; and 3.  Could maneuver so quietly, no visible propellers or exterior engines were visible and without any vapor trail or exhaust.   
 
It was scary and intriguing at the same time.

On the morning of September 26, 2022, I was driving along the Purple Heart Memorial Highway and noticed something high up in the sky. The morning was bright, without clouds in the sky, so visibility was very clear. Upon seeing the object, I immediately remembered that I had seen an identical object, in the same location, about a year so prior. The first time I saw the image, it caught my eye because it was a very bright, reflective, silver object in the middle of an open sky. It did not move, it just reflected the light as if the sunlight was reflecting off of a very shiny metallic surface. It was in the shape of a rectangle and lasted for about 40 seconds. I kept looking at it wondering what it could possibly be, and as I was looking at it, it appeared to turn sideways and completely disappear in a matter of a second. It was as if the object was flat so when it turned from showing it’s entire surface, it became a very thin sliver of a rectangle and then completely just disappeared. I continued to drive and look all around that area and never saw it again. This second time of seeing an object, it was similar in shape and reflectiveness and once again just vanished. It did not last (visibly) as long as the first sighting. But since I had seen it before I recognized what it could have been. I never saw this one again after it disappeared. I was far enough away from it that if it would have been a drone it would have appeared much smaller. This was a larger object in the sky for me to be able to see it like I did. It was also very high up in the sky so I’m not sure what would even fly that high up.",43.81333471882641,-91.22315061124694,09,Fall

As I was driving I looked up in the upper right hand corner of my windshield and I saw what looked like a shooting star or some type of firework.  I have seen shooting stars before but they always look so far away.  What stood out to me was this shooting star scared me because it appeared so close, it seemed to be a few blocks ahead of me.  It kind of looked like fire work show or comet but is didn’t have a long tail.  However I could see clearly that it was shooting in a downward direction in a way that I have never seen a firework do.  It also seemed to be too large to be any type of firework.  Basically it looked like a cylinder shape fire ball that shot down the sky and disappeared before it hit the ground.  It was the strangest thing I have ever seen and at this moment I think I either saw a comet, shooting star or a UFO,

About a minute or so it did reappear, some distance away.  I was looking to the west, and it was shortly after the sky had become completely dark.  The light was traveling from south to north.  It disappeared slightly to the southwest, and reappeared slightly to the northwest.  At that time, I believe that it blinked off and on once or twice, and then there was what appeared to be an electrical discharge, vertically.  It was like a very short bolt of lightning, except whiter, and perfectly straight, which I estimate took up about one to two degrees of distance in the sky (or, about the thickness of my finger at arm's length).  I almost had the feeling that the light itself had moved vertically, and almost instantly. It then disappeared and stayed that way.

If was moving around in no particular pattern but it seemed to be moving relatively slowly as it was hovering. I continued to stare at it for about 15 seconds, during this time it did not have any lights on it, all I could see was the shape of the object, which was exactly like what all the stereotypical drawings of what flying saucers look like. It was like a disk shape at the bottom, and then a rounded ball shape towards the top. I know it sounds crazy, and I’m not usually any kind of conspiracy theorist, I don’t do drugs or drink. I work in law enforcement and was completely sober when I saw this, so it was no! t a hallucination. After about 15 seconds of seeing it with no lights on it, I saw it slowly begin to light up gradually into a yellowish shade, but only at the very bottom of the object. At first I told myself maybe it was just the moon, as it took kind of like a crescent shape from my perspective, however the moon was in a completely different area of the sky, and the crescent shape of the moon should have been facing another way if that was the case. I kept staring at it, the light was way too big to be any kind of plane or helicopter. Maybe 15 more seconds went by, and I watched the light slowly fade and dim. Not like the object had flown away... more like someone had turned off the light, and it slowly faded out. After the light turned off I was no longer able to see the outline of the object like I could before the light had come on.  I think whatever it was turned off it’s light first and then decided to take off very quickly.

I was on top of a mountain near Mt. Tamalpais when I saw two huge rectangular shaped lights coming tpwards me with some kind of invisible object in between.  These two lights merged into one giant light which materialized into a giant upside down funnel looking cone which next took on the shape of a domed disc which kept getting thicker on the sides and more rounded while I watched it.  It started drifting toward a nearby hill and turned into what I would have to say is the identical Carlos Diaz plasma type craft seen in Mexico.   
 
This object next took on the shape of an oval turtle shell looking object, kind of lumpy and rigid looking before finally turning into a long glowing orange object that looked like a croissant that you would get at a bakery.  It was a blinding fluorescent orange and slightly bent at the end and seemed to drift right into this hillside or go behind it and never reappear again.  Meanwhile I was seeing clusters of these orange lights appearing over this hillside for a solid two hours that just seemed to come out od nowhere all taking on an orangish glow.

The triangular shape was at a slight angle to the path of movement, unlike a vapor trail.  The triangle did not change shape or size as it moved.

On my way home from shopping.. it was pitch black - and although there was a nearly full moon, what I saw was uncommon for our area. surrounding the moon for 1/4 mile left to right were luminescent clouds- like something was shinning a flash light only it was horizontal and about 1/4 mile wide.  I watched the lit up clouds for a distance and then took my eyes away to turn in the drive and when I looked back, the light was gone. 
 
The clouds look like they were lit up from behind. the moon was clearly visible as it was just above the clouds and it was not shinning through them.

Possible UFO Sighting, Tuesday, November 4, 2014 Locust Grove, Georgia, 30248 05:45 P.M. (17:45 hours)  The below sighting lasted roughly 30 seconds. 
 
Driving northbound on Georgia State Route 42, Locust Grove – McDonough, I observed what at first appeared to be a large commercial aircraft flying southbound, in my line of sight, above and to the right – due northeast – within the vantage point of my vehicle’s windshield, and (though I cannot confirm), it appeared to be traveling towards me, due south, some ten to fifteen or so miles in the distance, but bright enough for me to take notice. 
 
Though I was busy concentrating on the road, this apparition of light commanded my attention. I thought it odd that a commercial airliner was traveling due south over Henry County, as this flight path and direction is rather unusual for the local airspace (most commercial jets descend through Henry County on their approach into Atlanta-Hartsfield Jackson Airport, either from the south, east, and occasionally, the west, but rarely from the north; Henry County is located south of the airport). I assumed it was a commercial jet because of the pattern of lights – three concentric circles of white light, indicative to me of the two lights that appear on both wings of an airliner, and the center light that appears beneath the nose of an airliner. However, there were no other visible lights, red or green, colors that are clear markings of the wing tips of commercial airliners. I merely concluded that perhaps it was a jet that had taken off from Atlanta’s airport, and was traveling ! due south, though there was no visible or recognizable movement. 
 
However, in just under 30 seconds or so later, the lights simply vanished. The sun was setting at this point to my left, but it was still considerably bright enough to have noticed if this craft made any turn, the sunlight allowing for the possibility of identifying the shape or color of this craft; but no, all I had seen were lights, with no apparent movement, hovering in the distance, and in under a minute, they were gone. It was akin to the lights atop a water or radio tower, such lights that brighten, then fade, brighten, then fade; these lights definitely were bright, and definitely faded, but did not brighten again. It did not move or maneuver to another location in the horizon. The lights simply went out. 
 
I have never observed this kind of phenomenon before.  Thank you for considering this eyewitness account as evidence of a possible UFO sighting.",33.3444,-84.0915,11,Fall

After a few minutes, the dot vanished, almost as if it were being covered by some kind of dome that, as crazy as it sounds, felt like a cloaking device.  You could see it vanish from top to bottom and then, nothing but sky. 
 
As strange as we thought that was, we went back to looking at clouds.  A few minutes later off to our left, there it was again moving back overheard from our left, the west.  The white dot moved to several different locations, stopping, changing directions, etc.  It did this for several minutes before finally moving at a fairly high rate of speed to the northwest, where it disappeared in the distance.

Dec 14, 2015.  7:30 pm. North of Milwaukee, WI.  My son and I were on the back deck enjoying a calm night, semi clear sky, and unseasonably warm temperature.  He said that he thought there was supposed to be meteor activity so we were sitting and looking up.  He burst out, “Whoa!”.  I see a “dash” shaped object glowing brightly and streaking high across the North sky from East to West within our atmosphere.  It wasn’t a meteor, there was no atmospheric piercing flash and fade.  It was a constant light or glow and moved at what appeared a consistent altitude.  It streaked quickly, then appeared to instantaneously stop or slow and then streak again just as fast.  Only lasted 2-3 seconds to cross the sky and gone.  No sound or visible exhaust, no blinking lights.

We headed outside approximately 6:30pm and my husband and I immediately saw this huge ""star"" hovering above the setting sun.  We are always looking at the sky, my husband is a flight director at the Deming Blimp site, so I knew it was way too early for stars.  Mars is the first one in the sky and it appears over the Florida mountains.  This ""star"" was the opposite direction over the setting sun. I took my son inside and grabbed our camera because phone cameras can't pick up stars well.  My husband and I called our neighbors and they went outside and saw it as well.  We watched it for 40 minutes. During that time it never moved with the earth and never blinked like a star, just shown like a spotlight.  It did however change from a circle to a guitar pick shape.  We were extremely excited and nervous and that made for not great videos but we have ! videos and lots of pictures of it.  During the 40 minutes another bright light appeared above and to the left of the original light and moved straight down toward earth and disappeared. Then 3 lights appeared around the original light and moved straight down and disappeared. The original light seamed to join them at this point and moved down and disappeared but it shrank to disappear.  All of this happened in less than a minute.  We rushed inside to download the footage into the computer because I have heard of weird things going on with equipment when things like this occur.  While my husband was downloading the pictures and video onto our computer the orb came back in the night about 8:30 pm.  This time it was in the North.  This time it was close to were the Blimp is in the Deming sky.  This time there was another light with it hovering to its left.  It was there for about 10 minutes and then disappeared.",32.2333,-107.7453,09,Fall

They were close enough that had there been lines and people below the parachute I would have seen them and there were none. 
 
 One had a reddish glow below. Almost like the light of a fire. They did appear to be drifting downward to the north. There were several groups of them. Maybe 3 or 4 per group. They descended below the trees and went out of sight. 
 
 Two other people observed this with me. It lasted for several minutes as when I first saw the gray objects no one else was near me. Then two other people came outside and I pointed the floating objects out and they saw them as well.

It was not a plane, there were other planes in the sky with their white and red flashing lights but this orange fireball was definitely not a plane.

Bigger and brighter than before it shined through the trees.  As we drove foward and the trees disappeared to make room for the highway exit, two more bright orange lights appeared next to it.

We were a little amazed to see two objects (dim points of light) that looked to be satellites moving across the sky from northwest to southeast. They were moving together in what looked to be perfect synchronization.  Having seen the International Space Station earlier we knew that it couldn’t be that. I have never seen two satellites move together like that. They appeared to be about an inch apart (as seen from our point of view).

I live in Redlands, which is about 6 miles EESE of San Bernardino, CA. 
 
At a little before midnight New Year’s Eve, 2010, I went out on my east-facing front porch to listen to the celebratory noise. 
 
Approximately 00:05 am I observed two glowing objects rise from the NNE from my vantage point. 
 
The objects were, to my eyes, about as bright, and were about the same angular size, as the planet Jupiter (when it is on the zenithal arc). 
 
These objects seem to have risen from NE Mentone, the next town east of Redlands. 
 
The atmospheric conditions caused them to slowly rise, in an apparent north-westerly direction. 
 
The sky was overcast with some low stratus and cumulus clouds.  I was able to track these objects for about 10 to 12 minutes before they entered obscurity in the clouds, or their inherent light source went out. 
 
The two objects appeared to originate from the same ground location.  Their apparent angular separation ranged from about ½ degree to 2 degrees. 
 
My supposition is that they were large balloons carrying an ignition source well below the balloons themselves (to keep from burning the balloons). 
 
The light they gave off was mostly white, with a slight reddish tinge.  The time of their disappearance was approximately 00:20 am.  From the time of first notice, to final disappearance, they traveled approximately 55 degrees azimuthally. 
 
Thought I would write this in case anyone else saw the same thing. 
 
About midway through November, in the late afternoon, I saw two similarly-sized objects, with about the same apparent luminosity.  They, however (or at least at the time I noticed them), were separated by about 30 degrees, and had much different trajectories.  It is quite possible that their point of origination was also in NE Mentone – perhaps these were test flights?",34.048139285714285,-117.17355357142856,01,Winter

At 8:00PM, Thanksgiving evening, I was sitting on my second story deck in Cranford, NJ, stargazing, when I observed a strange, orange light in the sky off to my right.  I watched the light for a few seconds to see if it had other lights on it and if it was possibly a plane (as I am in the flight path for Newark Airport), but it did not and was not… 
 
I grabbed my binoculars, and through them observed a bright orange sphere, flying due east, at the same altitude that small aircraft fly to get to Newark Airport (North West of my location), but it wasn't going toward the airport.  The orb did not pulse or strobe, and it seemed to be a brighter white light in the center, with the warm orange light surrounding it.  I could not make out a definitive outline for the object, and there were no discernable features from my perspective.

There were no clouds for it to disappear behind, and the moon was large, bright, and full to my left.

I go to work very early in the morning.  On Tuesday, April 15, at around 3:40 A.M., as I was just about to open my car door and get in, I suddenly got the thought to ""look up"".  I did look up directly at a very bright light in the northwestern sky.  It was bigger and brighter than any star or planet I have ever seen.  As I watched, I noticed it was moving slowly due north.  It remained bright for only a few seconds and rapidly faded to a very small and dim dot that continued north.  I watched it for maybe ten seconds, and then got in my car and proceeded to work.  I have to admit I was a little shaken by the experience because of my sudden impulse and thought to look up. 
 
This is not the first object I have seen and I have made quite a few reports here.  I seem to see things like this quite often, not really sure why. 
 
I don't know what it was, but it was this single bright white light, MUCH larger and brighter than any star or planet I have ever seen.  I did not see any red or green directional lights as aircraft have.  I could not tell how high it was, but I got the impression it was very high up in the sky, maybe 30-40,000 feet or so.  It was difficult to judge the speed as well, but it moved about the speed an airliner would move at high altitude. 
 
I have seen aircraft high in the sky light up when they reflect the sun, but this was a full 3 hours before sunrise, so I do not believe that is what I saw. 
 
Anyway, that is it, it was a very simple and short sighting, but it did shake me up for awhile that morning.",41.81389999999999,-73.1123,04,Spring

My wife and I were traveling south on Route 11 somewhere between Canfield, and Columbiana OH when the sighting first occurred. Time was approximately 12:45AM EST. Not many cars headed in either direction. Traveling at about 65-70mph. We first noticed what looked like a super bright star that was an intense greenish turquoise at our 11 O'Clock (SSE direction from us). Probably between 300-500 yards off the ground. 
 
 For about 2-3 minutes the object looked to stay in about the same position, but got slightly closer to us where it passed directly over our car. I was the driver so I wasn't able to accurately see the outline of the vehicle. But I am certain as it got closer there was a bright greenish light on the front, and two red lights parallel at the rear of the craft, with one of them blinking. The green light was VERY brilliant, and ""crisp"" almost like a super bright LED light. Not what I would typically see on a helicopter. We had our windows down without the radio on, and did not hear any type of propeller that you would expect to hear from a helicopter. 
 
 A few seconds later my wife was able to see it directly above us slightly to the west. She feels very confident that the craft was a solid triangular shape with rounded edges, as it was silhouetted in front of the cloud. She also saw a greenish light, with a red, and what she believed to be a white light in parallel. But, she said she was more focused on the outline of the craft that color/locations of the light. 
 
 For a few more minutes the craft essentially seemed to keep pace with us (approx 65mph) to our west, but getting slightly further in a westerly direction. After a few more minutes it seemed to fall behind us towards the WNW until we lost sight of it as we were driving through a wooded area. 
 
 Our thoughts on common craft as an explanation: Airplane: It was traveling/hovering too slowly to remain in the air, but also keep pace with us at 65mph. 
 
Helicopter: My wife saw an outline of the vehicle as a triangle, and did not see any propellers. We also did not hear anything that would indicate a helicopter. 
 
Drone: Unless there was someone driving in a car near us controlling the drone, we are not sure how it could have kept pace with us over that 5-7 mile distance at 65mph. 
 
Balloon: The object came at us from the SSE, then kept pace with us at our west. Which is not a normal jet stream for the area to carry a balloon. 
 
 The craft did not make any erratic movements, but what was odd was that it kept pace with us while seemingly remaining silent. 
 
 Both observers are in their 30s, and did not have any alcoholic beverages that early morning/previous night.

On the evening of July 4th, my son and I were in the backyard, as he was letting off some fireworks.  I was sitting in a chair facing north a few feet from where he was at.  I was watching the fireworks that he let off, as well as some others in the neighborhood.  I was looking east up in the sky.  I saw a small light, thinking it was the remains of someone's fireworks.   
 
As I kept watching, it moved and got bigger.  It was heading SW in the sky and was orange in color.  It appeared to be oval shaped but looked like there was a smaller area on the top also orange.  The light was solid and did not blink.  Due to all the fireworks around us, it was noisy, but in moments of silence I could not hear any noise coming from the object.  
 
I kept watching until my view was obstructed by a tree, that was close by.  I jumped up to see if I could still see, it but it was gone.  It either disappeared, or went behind the tree where I could not see it any more.

From about 23:30 to about 1:30 on 7/9/12- 7/10/12, I witnessed a UFO.  The first sighting was around 23:30.  While stargazing, I saw a bright light.  At first I thought it was Venus.  I then realized that it was far too bright to be planet Venus.  As I studied it more closely, the craft got brighter and it accelerated from the northern sky towards the southern sky. 
 
The second sighting took place around 0:15.  I was toying with my CB radio in my car.  For some reason, my radio could get outstanding reception.  I could listen to people as faraway as South Carolina and Oklahoma.  My car was facing west this time.  I saw the same craft.  As I studied it, the craft accelerated from the South Western sky to the Western sky.  I could only see it for 5-7 seconds.  The craft got brighter and it accelerated getting dimmer until I could only see its green lights. 
 
I could barely see the green lights.  The green lights only lasted for a few seconds.  There were five clusters of lights.  Each cluster had two lights.  There were four on the outside of the craft and one cluster in the center of the craft. 
 
The last sighting took place around 1:00.  It was the same event, a bright light gaining in intensity and then loosing its brightness as it was accelerating.  This was on the southern horizon.  I could not see any of the green lights that I saw before.  The third was too far on the horizon to witness what was happening beneath of it.

In between the light flashes, the object didn't move much more the a passenger plane would have moved, it flashed one more time and I never saw any lights again, it just disappeared.   
 
I noticed there were no other navigation lights.  No red or green nor a flashing white. this flight path was west to east and would have to be 10 to 30 thousand feet.  No contrail was observed.  No sound heard. 
 
I would describe the light as very bright like a helicopter landing light.  The light was to my south and between 75 to 80 degrees, almost overhead. 
 
Within about 1 minute there was a plane making an east to west pass almost on a reciprocal course and altitude, all lights were visible, you could hear it, there was no comparison between the two.

Witness 1:  About 8:30 p.m. eastern time, I observed a number of objects moving across the sky.  Each object looked like it didn’t have wings and solid red lights on the side and some had solid white lights on the side.  The objects moved across the sky one at a time and it lasted about five minutes.  There were approximately twelve of them, one at a time. 
 
Witness 2:  At about 8:15 p.m. eastern time, I observed a silver color object moving across the sky, until I couldn’t see it anymore because it went behind the trees.  I stayed looking into the sky and saw the same object again from where I first had spotted it as if it went backwards.  About 15 minutes after I saw the first object I saw approximately twelve after that but they looked different.  They had solid red lights on the side and some with solid white lights.  They appeared one at a time and the timing between each one seemed to be the same length in time. 
 
Witness 3:  At 8:15 eastern time, I was sitting outside with my mom.  I all of a sudden looked at the sky as a flat silver colored object was moving across the sky.  I then pulled out my phone and began taking pictures of the object I was seeing.  This object was flying left in the sky.  I didn’t see it for two seconds and this same silver object now flying left in the sky as if it turned around and started going right.  We then called down my grandfather  and started showing him what we were seeing.  This object had no lights and just looked like a disc.  The pictures we took weren’t coming out well since I was capturing these pictures on my iphone.  All of a sudden several different objects were flying out one after another in the matter of 30 seconds.  They all looked different though, as in different colors around. Some with red solid lights that were not blinking.  And some with solid white lights that were not blinking.  There were at least twelve in total, two of them that were flying in the sky were in sync and were flying above each other.",41.674,-73.0075,06,Summer

There is a very bright light that comes up about 8:30. It is very bright. I thought it was a satelite or something but it comes up every night.  About 9:30 when you look up at the sky to the left, you can see blinking lights.  Sometimes they look red. When you look straight out over the garage to the right, you see a second one doing the same thing. It is much further out though but still you can see it. Over the course of 3 hours until after midnight the 'bright' satelite looking light moves up and by midnight, it is directly above my back door.  As that light moves up, the light on the left moves up and comes closer so you can see that it.  The one up in the right side you can see it but not as profoundly as the left side. Last night I was able to see that it looked like a saucer, it has lights around it so you can see the shape. It seems to be spinning and moving side to side but it stays in only these areas. In other words, it does the absolutely same thing each evening.  I have been watching this now for two weeks. I can see that is is a saucer with lights.  Last night an airplace flew across the sky and went over it. The 'saucer' dimmed its lights to almost zero.  After the aircraft move away, the lights came back up. There are two crafts here.  There is no doubt.  My mother, and neighbor have both been here and seen it. I do not understand why this is not being investigated by our government. There is absolutely something over Katy Texas. It comes back each evening and does the same thing. As the bright star moves up, these two saucers come in closer. Last night I could literally see the shape and lights. My neighbor has taken photos of it and there are hieroglaplics that look like a #3. This may be our technology. I suspect it could be because it seems to do the same and stay on the same track every single evening.",29.79057163636364,-95.78978218181815,10,Fall

2 UFOs came from deep off the horizon at night from the ocean.  They flew faster than any plane I ever say.  They flew interwining paths.  Both had a red light at top and both appeared to be in the shape of a cross with the horizontal arms of the cross the widest.  The cross was all in light.  No sign of any metal craft.  They paused for a second when I waved hello from my porch which was lite up.  When I opened my jacket to pull out my strongest glasses they flew south toward the bird sanctuary which is all forest and deserted.  Both UFOs were silent yet only were about 500 feet off the group and barely 1 full city block away over the ocean.  I thought they were fighter jets because of the red light at top.  However, I realized later they were UFOs since planes do not appear as light in the shape of a cross.  They appeared at first as flying stars.  When I put on my strongest glasses for fine reading I could see the light had a red light on top with a cross shape of white light.  The arms of the cross of light were the widest.  40 years ago my mom and I would watch these UFOs fly high up in the sky.  We have not see any UFOs in the area ever since.  This is the first time they have returned and the first time they fly so low.  A MIG flew by years ago when the President of the USA permitted a MIG to flew across the country.  So my home is a flight path for civilian and military craft.  For this reason I thought the 2 UFOs were USA fighter planes until I realized the crafts were all light and nothing metal formed the crafts.  The red light on top of each craft told me that they must be USA or earth bound crafts so I did not call any authorities.",39.9225,-74.0811,10,Fall

I observed the same extremely bright object in the southern sky for the past 14 nights in a row. The first time my wife and I noticed it, it appeared to be landed on a deserted mountain range. We saw it move slightly to the left, right, up, and down. Ever since 1/20/12, I have seen it in the same region of the sky, or if cloudy or raining, it appears upon this same mountain range, sometimes motionless until after dawn. I have ruled out the typical planet theory. This object moves in such a way to blend in with the stars. But if you watch it for any length of time, you can tell it is indeed moving in an unnatural way. Because it varies slightly in location, I have determined that it has to be within the atmosphere and fairly close. The unique aspect of this object is its appearance for this many consecetive nights.

I walked outside didn’t see anything but heard it.  I walked down my front  porch and into my yard  and looked over and in the distance saw and  thought it was one of those dual helicopters that have two propellers and it was flying west from a south easterly direction.   So I thought no big deal, and went back inside.  5 minutes later I hear d a sound of a louder lower something.  So I went outside expecting another helicopter and looked up and saw a triangular craft.   It had one green light on one tip, a red light on another tip, and white light on another tip,  and somewhere on the outer rim was a red light which I assume was the cockpit.  It flew over at 11:31 central time.  It was flying low.  I went back inside thinking I had seen the last of it, and it proceeded to fly over my house, an additio! nal 5 times.    At one point I watched it fly up near a commercial craft high up in the sky, and it was at least 10 times bigger than the craft from my vantage point.   I was on the phone with the Highway Patrol seeing if they could get a patrolman out on Hwy 72 to see this thing.

I stepped onto my porch a little past 1am on September 21st, and immediately noticed 4 glowing orange circular orbs -- all noticeably larger, and brighter than stars, and headed eastward.  They were paired off in twos.  The first pair swarmed toward and then away from each other in a very succinct manner.  They were glowing brighter than their neighboring pair.  The second pair was to the left, and lower in the sky than the first pair, but they were all in the same vicinity.  The brighter pair started to fade and eventually disappeared into the night sky.  The second pair grew brighter when the first pair first started to fade.  They were interacting in the same manner as the first pair -- almost like a well rehearsed dance between partners.  They too started to fade and after a few more seconds faded completely into the night.  The whole sighting lasted about 30-40 seconds.

Hello Peter!  
 
The sighting happened at approximately 12:00 am this morning (Sunday)  I did not get any video because we were kind of in shock as to what we were seeing.  It wasn't until after we came back in that I realized i should have grabbed my phone.   
 
I didn't even know I could even report it until I did some online research to see if we were the only ones who saw the object!!   
 
I will definitely keep my eyes peeled to the sky and if it comes back, I will be ready to record it!!

On 22 December 2018 at approximately 2200hrs, I was taking my dog out for the final time of the night. The moon was extremely bright and clouds were patchy. As I looked up at the moon, I noticed a large number of solid lights traveling from a southeastern to northwestern direction.  All lights were equidistant and in the same formation. 
 
I couldn't guess the altitude...much higher than commercial flights.  There were several normal aircraft in the area. 
 
I watched about 25-30 of these lights fly over, I tried to record them with my phone, but thanks to the bright moon, didn't get anything. 
 
I went inside and told my wife to come outside and look.  She was baffled, especially at the speed they were traveling.  Much to fast to be a commercial flight, and too many on the same flight path. 
 
I tried looking on the airplane tracker sites to see what was in the air at the time, and nothing out of the norm.  Definitely not what we witnessed.",41.55555714285715,-72.66324285714286,12,Winter

We were outside looking at the stars after having a bonfire. It was about 8:30-9:30 pm and extremely dark outside.  We were looking at the sky and my sister suddenly got really quiet and pointed at this object that was very close to us.  It was an oval shape with about 6 lights around the exterior.  It flew above the tree line, and moved back and forth in the sky, and eventually took off behind the trees.  Some of the lights were blue, orange, and red.  A couple of years earlier, we went to my grandparents house, and we saw the exact same object fly past our car window on the way home at about 9:00 pm.  We stood there shocked, especially me because I saw the same object and it left me with the s! ame feeling.  I hope this organization can look over this encounter and take this message seriously.

On December 31, 2013 at 19:01 local time, while walking to my car from a retail parking lot, I observed in the sky a red/orange light in the sky.  The object appeared to be approximately five to six thousand feet in altitude and four to five miles west-southwest of downtown Clarkston, Washington.  The object appeared to flicker a bit during the nine minute observation of the object before it finally dimmed out completely.  At the object’s brightest (when I first observed it), it appeared to be about the intensity of the planet, Venus, shortly after sunset.  The object appeared to travel east, then reverse direction and ascend slightly before dimming out to the point where it was no longer visible.  It dimmed out completely at 19:01. 
 
This object was most definitely not an aircraft of any sort.  The object did not have a rotating beacon, strobes, or any other position (navigation) lights required for nighttime flight. I am a commercial pilot with single engine and multi-engine ratings, as well as an FAA certificated flight instructor, so I’m very familiar with what aircraft of all sorts look like in both daytime and nighttime flight.

I was sitting outside at app. 11:30 PM DST, hoping to observe some meteors from the Perseid meteor shower.  At about 11:40 PM, I happened to get a glimpse of an object moving south to north, against the direction I was expecting to see meteors.  At first I thought it might be a satellite, but quickly realized it was moving way too fast to be one.  I stood up to get a better view of this fast moving object, then quickly noticed a second object trailing the first object, same relative speed, same relative direction. 
 
 As I watched, the trailing object overtook the first object, shooting slightly ahead of it, then slowing slightly in order to be flying adjacent to the first object.  The spacing of the two objects was about the width of a fist held at arms length. When the two objects were adjacent to each other, they then veered slightly into a northeast direction, flying in this `formation' until flying out of sight. 
 
 The total duration of this event was about 10 seconds.  These two objects were the same relative size, slightly larger than a common satellite viewed from Earth, moving way too fast to be satellites.  I listened to hear any jet sounds, if any existed, but no sound was heard.

At approximately 17:40, while driving home along Unser Blvd NW, I observed a bright, but strangely short meteor enter to the northwest.  Impressed by how vivid this fireball was, I shortly put it out of my mind. 
 
At around 20:00 I had stepped outside of my westside Albuquerque home to have a cigarette and load items into the car for a weekend trip to Canjilon, NM.  Catching motion out of the corner of my eye, I glanced at the western sky and observed numerous shimmering balls of light crossing rapidly from northwest to southeast.  I promptly ran inside and called for my fiancee to step out as well in order that she could verify what I was observing.  I also retrieved my 60 power spotting scope.  She stepped out with me and we watched in amazement as these objects continued to stream across the sky.  Using my spotting scope, I was able to track one of these objects and was surprised to discover that the scope did not magnify it nearly as much as I would have expected.  I take this to mean that the objects were further away than my initial estimate.  The object I observed with the scope was circular, and while it appeared a bluish white to the naked eye, it seemed to be like a disco ba! ll-shimmering in many different colors.  I put the scope down and continued to observe with the naked eye until all of them had passed.  There was little if any noise from these objects aside from a faint ""muttering"" rumble.  Their movement was erratic and uncoordinated, with some of them traveling faster, and taking wavering paths, but all generally to the southeast.    They traveled very quickly-seemingly three times as fast as I would expect an aircraft to move at the same distance.  They  passed in three groups, with the majority of the objects comprising the lead group-almost reminiscent of the way race cars move about on a track.  I considered taking photographs or video, but considering the apparent size of the objects, their velocity, and the state of darkness at that time of night, video would have been inconclusive and photographs would have been nearly impossible.

Then for the next few minutes we saw what looked like orange balls start as one then go upwards two three four.  It couldn't of been flares because it was moving from the right side of Garden City to Surf Side and towards Myrtle Beach way to fast.  They would start to light up going upwards then just fade out sometimes in the middle and towards the left at the same time.   
 
Someone called the police dept to see if maybe was a distress flare they told her it was military drill or something of that sort.

I  pointed it out to my wife whom was standing right next to me.  She didn't see it at first but finally saw it.  That was the first UFO that really had me scratching my head.

I really was hoping to find more reports of this because it was such a nice night and figured there would have been more people outside that night that may have seen them.  I thought they possibly could have been meteors, but, I have never seen a meteor act that way, usually they are more like a shooting star to the best of my knowledge.

My lady and I were watching television this evening.  Our sofa faces the west window exposure in our loft.  It was around 9:40 p.m. when I jumped off the couch yelling ""what the he'll is that?!?""  My lady looked and couldn't believe it either.  What we had seen was a green fireball like object jet across the window exposure wickedly fast.  There was a small trail behind it but quickly dissipated.  The fireball then vanished into the sky while moving south west.  What's interesting is that I've seen this green fireball twice before in a property we lived in just one block east from where we currently reside in 2004.  It was seen traveling in the same south west direction.  My lady didn't necessarily believe me until this evening.  I can say what we saw this evening lasted roughly 12-15 seconds.  In our prior living space we had north west exposures so I know it had come from that direction.  Tonight It just appeared west and travelled south west.  She and I thought maybe fireworks initially but there are no structures surrounding to allow a launch in that direction especially being it moved horizontally.

At approximately 06:11, on 12/10/19, I stepped out to smoke a cigarette, like I do every morning.  I looked up to catch sight of the meteor shower, and to look for satellites.  This is something I do every morning, when getting my kids ready for school. 
 
As I watched, I noticed what I thought was a satellite going from the North West, to the South West. I then saw another, behind it.  I thought I was lucky, and able to see 2 satellites at the same time.  I then noticed, that there were a string of them ahead of the 2 that I originally saw.  They kept ""popping"" out of the sky in the same spot, and going off into the horizon. 
 
I started counting, and looked closer at them through a pair of binoculars.  They were Oval in shape from what I could see, No flashing lights, just what seemed to be a reflection of sunlight.  I couldn't get a very clear view of them through the binoculars, and wished I had a better way of seeing them.  There were over 100 that I saw, but they were already flying over when I went out, so I don't know exactly how many there were. 
 
My neighbor came home, and I asked her to look up.  She also saw them.  Starlink would not have them joining in the formation from the sides, like some of them were doing.

I was returning from a business trip with two colleagues on Alaska Airlines from DC to LA.  Over the Grand Canyon, I saw a black craft shaped like a bullet going at an amazing speed in the opposite direction very close to our airplane leaving a trail of thick black smoke behind it.   
 
A few minutes later, an identical craft with the same black trail went by.  I would concede it may have been a military plane, but thing that bothers me is that the smoke trail dissipated at the exact same speed as the craft, as if it were a part of it.  If a military plane were emitting black smoke from burning oil, it would have left a trail across the sky.   
 
What my friends couldn't see because I was in the window seat is just before the second craft left my view, I saw it tilt upward and the black smoke trail disappeared in a split second. 
 
The crazier part of the story is that when I returned home, I was telling my son the story while looking out the window of our home in Beverly Hills, CA.  I saw two brilliant white planes flying towards us.  I didn't think anything of it until the one on the right just disappeared, then the one on the left made a perfectly tight loop in the air, then disappeared.  It was a manoeuvre that would be impossible with a plane, and it was close enough that I could tell it was not a helicopter.   
 
This was at about 3pm on 2/24/13.

May 1, 2020 Driving on the 10 freeway at 8:00ish PM from California to Arizona near mile marker 43 just before the Vicksburg Rd exit 45. 
 
 2 sets of 3 large orangish glowing lights in a row side by side above and just beyond the hills directly on the north side of the freeway.  They weren’t high enough to be a plane and they were just sitting there not moving in any direction.  I assumed they were connected to a tower to alert air traffic of the small mountain/foothill.  The height was too high to be a tower but it was pitch dark and I was trying to make sense of it.  As I pointed them out to my sister and cousin in the car, they turned off.  Not all at once but kind of just like powered down quickly.  I waited for them to come on thinking if they were on a tower, they’d be on a timer and they would reappear on and off.  They didn’t. 
 
 About 15 seconds after they went out, there was a tiny flash of white light in the darkness where the other lights had been.  Still I was the only one who saw it. 
 
 Thankfully, about 15 seconds after that, 3 of the lights came back on and stayed on for a few seconds in which my cousin was able to witness them as well before turning off again for good.  Then another larger white flash of light and then nothing. 
 
 We kept looking and nothing again.  We watched behind us until we were too far.  They were gone. 
 
 So 2 days later we were driving back home to California and as we came up on that same mountain/foothill, we investigated to make sure there wasn’t a tower there.  There was nothing.  Just desert. 
 
 Also, just west of where we saw the lights there is a foothill with towers on it, lots.  But they were far behind us at the time we saw the lights and they are clearly visible whereas the foothill we saw the lights near has nothing on them or on the ground below.  Just don’t want anyone to think we saw the foothill with the towers, it was definitely behind us at the time where these were directly to our left (north). 
 
 Maybe someone knows what this was but I’ve made this drive multiple times a year for the past 15 years and I’ve never seen anything like that out in the darkness.  I have no explanation.

I was out on the night of July 7th at about 9:35pm to check and make sure the garage door was closed. I have a 91 year old father that I take care of and sometimes he leaves the garage door open. We do not have a door from inside the house to inside the garage. 
 
I usually look up at sky and look for Ursa Major and Minor and Polaris. I saw something hovering above the neighbor’s trees but was not directly above the trees. I’m not sure how far away it was nor the height in the night sky. If I had to guess it could have been anywhere from ¼ of a mile to ½ a mile in the sky from my perspective. 
 
The sun set in Salt Lake at 9:01pm so it was dark on the East side of the Salt Lake valley. The moon was in the western sky at about 45° above the Oquirrh mtns. 
 
The object changed colors from green to red about every 2 sec. and remained in the sky at the same location and never moved or drifted. I watched it for about 2 minutes or so. It was a very bright color change and larger looking than that of a planes wing or belly lights. 
 
At first I thought it may have been a drone but I thought at such a late hour would probably not be a good time to be flying since the sky was so dark. 
 
I went back inside got my phone (Samsung S8+) and shot a video (20220707_21406.mp4) just over 1 min. long. The object was still in the same spot and had not moved. I was leaning against the side of the garage to stabilize my arm and phone. The video was taken in portrait mode so when you play it, the object will be on the left side of the video. If you rotate it 90° to the right you will get how I recorded it. 
 
I went back inside and got my Canon Rebel T3i and put my zoom lens on it. The zoom lens is an EFS 55-250mm w/image stabilization and MACRO 1.1m/3.6ft. Just a standard zoom lens. 
 
I haven’t used this camera for a couple of years so I needed to re-familiarize myself with the camera. One of the two pictures show movement but that is because I had not stabilized myself using the side of the garage and you can see the trees that are out of focus just below the object. 
 
I took two pictures (IMG_2965.jpg, IMG_2967.jpg) and 2 movies (MVI_2966 and MVI_2968). 
 
MVI_2966 is about 46 sec. long. MVI_2968 was about 6 sec. long. I did not upload it. 
 
I went back inside so I could see the options on the lens to make sure that both the AF (auto focus) and Stabilizer switches were both on. 
 
I went back outside and the object was gone. I live on a corner with a 4-way stop 
 
I walked back to my porch when I heard my neighbor (whom lives diagonally from me on the other corner) had just gotten out of their car. I turned to see that the mother and one of the daughters had walked into the street and the daughter was pointing to the same area of the sky. I could not hear what she was saying but she moved her arm in a direction from left to right, as she did this I did hear her make a sound like “whoosh” as if to indicate that whatever was in the sky moved very fast in that direction. 
 
I was going to call to them but by the time I got to the end of my driveway they were already back on theirs and heading for their front door. 
 
Picture (20220708_143221a.jpg) was taken today July 8th from the same spot looking towards the sky. The trees in the picture are the same ones that are in the other pictures. The object was above the larger tree behind the pine. I put a circle to indicate approximate location.

I was taking my daughter home after work on this evening.  It was about 11:00 at night and we were sitting by her mailbox when we noticed lights down the road towards the rental property she lives in on a farm here.  The lights were small, much like backup lights on a car, so we just thought that it was her landlords working on a farm truck.  We sat by the mailbox and waited a minute or so for them to come out of the road.   
 
When after a few minutes, the lights were still there, I pulled my car up closer to the lights.  As we approached them, they backed up into the hayfield.  I had my car window rolled down to listen, as the neighbors entrance, the first on the road  is where the lights were first-on the ground and their dogs were barking and crying and howling!   We didn’t hear any motor noises from the “farm truck” and wondered why it backed all the way to the back of the hayfield!   Then the two lights got bigger and brighter, though there was no beam.  As ! soon as we saw them rise up into the air, we knew it wasn’t our friends in any farm truck.  I speed up to catch up and the faster I went, the fast it went.  The , bigger now, lights went up and over the fence of the hayfield, across the farmers road, across the fence to the cow pasture and went along about 15 feet above the ground.  I was speeding at this point, faster than I would have ever driven down the road , maybe 25 mph, but couldn’t catch up.  It flew under some power lines and straight up into the air and behind  my daughter’s house where it “hung” there until we got into the lot in front of  her house. 
 
We sat in front of her house and looked up at the lights for about a minute, when they just “poof” went out, or the thing sped away.  We had both  front windows  of the car open by now and can verify that there was not a single sound  of any motor or of any power plant within the UFO.  And again, there was no beam of light coming in our direction or any other.  The lights were just there!  We found out the next day that our friend, the landlady of the farm had seen the lights when she came home, about 30 minutes before we did.  She saw it in the area, above the river, behind the house in about the same location that we had last seen it.  So we know that it had been hanging around for a much longer time than we saw it.

It was 8 object, best way to describe tubes (straws) completely lit up but also each had maybe 4 flashing lights.  They were all touching seem to be one object but then a few seconds split away from each other turn into circular shapes, then completely lit like a red/orange color.  Splitting away from each other changing into a circular shape, then floating close to each other.  Flying away and also turning all visual lights off.   
 
I have never seen anything like it in my life and it really made my blood drop.  I am not a believer and never put thought into it but what I saw was something out of this world and made me scare.  Sharing my story.

I see a orange glowing orb moving from east to west heading towards this little bar called Sluggers.  My house is about 3/4 mile away from the bar (as the crow flies),Didnt think too much of it right away because My house is kinda near a flight path for Waukesha Cty Airport. Thoughht maybe it was a light for an airplane or whatever until it made a complete stop RIGHT OVER the top of the tree line.  It was a pretty quiet and dark night. The craft or ""orb"" hovered there for about 20 or so seconds and then a huge bright yellow/whiteish light emmited from the craft/orb. It was so bright that anyone looking in that dirrection couldnt have missed it. there was absolutly no noise or ground vibrations that you would nomally feel and hear from a low flying helicopter, and the tree tops remained motionless. the large bright light shined for quite some time and then shut off. as s! oon as that light turned off two more lights , i think they were red and white, started blinking. this may sound weird to most people but it was almost like this firey orange glowing orb turned into a helicopter. It was too dark out to see what it ""morphed"" into, but i think it was trying to mimic a regular aircraft or something...after this thing got done doing what ever it was doing, it continued to travel west with the two lights still blinking. that was by far the weirdest sight that ive ever seen. i will keep my eyes posted in the night sky everytime i go outside now. i couldnt believe i saw that. its something that ya here about from time to time but to experiance it was somethin else.  If anyone reading this and is from my area, please make a report of it so i can stop thinking that im loosing my mind  KEEP YOUR EYES TO THE SKY...THESE THINGS MAY LOOK LIKE YOUR EVERYDAY HELICOPTERS AFTER THEY GET DONE CHANGING THERE FORM.

I feel foolish for not submitting this sighting the day I had witnessed it.  But seeing the recent reports in the northeast about three lights travelling so close together around the time of my sighting, I feel compelled to submit a report of what I saw. 
 
I don't remember the exact date, but it was around the last week of July, perhaps July 26th.  However, I do know that it was between 5:30 and 5:40 A.M., because this is the time that I go to work. 
 
Details:  As I was headed northeast on I-99, I noticed three bright lights in the northern sky, only several degrees above the horizon.  These lights remained very close to one another in a vertical formation, never separating more than about one degree from the other.  The movement of the formation was very slight, but there was definitely movement. 
 
The lights were bright white, almost silvery.  I could not distinguish a tail or anything of the sort.  As an amateur astronomer, I know for a fact that they were not planets because they were well north of the ecliptic. 
 
Conditions: Seeing conditions on this morning were clear.  During this time frame, it had been very hot in my area, with highs from the upper 80's to the mid 90's, and lows from the mid to upper 60's. 
 
If you could mark my position on Shiloh Road, looking toward the northeast drawing a straight line, the line would pass over Pleasant Gap, State Game Lands 295, and Williamsport.  There was no way for me to guess the distance of the formation. 
 
Hopefully, someone saw the same thing and can corroborate this sighting.  If you did see something that closely matches the details of my sighting, don't be shy and *don't be afraid* - REPORT IT.

The object was circular, white, and had no blinking lights.  It moved across the clear sky for ~10 seconds then vanished.   
 
Only a few seconds later a second star appeared it too being white, circular, and had no other lights.  It appeared almost in the same place as the first UFO, but moved from the north to the south. It moved for ~ 5 seconds then vanished.   
 
All the UFOs moved about the same speed, which was faster than an aircraft, but not streaking, and made no sound.   
 
A few minutes passed, and yet another star appeared from the same location, and moved from the northwest to the southeast.  It was the same size, color, and shape as the previous UFOs. This one moved for ~ 10 seconds then vanished.!   
 
At exactly 05:10, (I checked my watch) another UFO appeared from a different location, but close to the others.  It was white, circular, and about the size of a star as were the previous three.  It too appeared from overhead just like the previous three, but moved west to east.  This UFO moved across the sky till I could not see it anymore.  It did not vanish.  There were no aircraft seen during these sightings, but I saw 2 shooting stars.

http://www.thetelegraph.com/news/news/152223390/Fireball-in-sky-over-Alton-creates-buzz. 
 
‘Fireball’ in sky over Alton creates buzz  ALTON — Did little green men take a cruise in their spaceship over Alton?  Probably not — but something strange in the sky caught the attention of several Telegraph readers Thursday evening. 
 
According to Robert Lunsford of the American Meteor Society (AMS), reports of a fireball came from across the state Thursday evening. 
 
“The sightings were clustered right around Chicago,” Lunsford said. “We’ve only received a couple from the St. Louis area.  We have 34 total sightings. St. Louis seems to be on the southwestern edge of our reports.  It was apparently seen as far away as Ann Arbor, Michigan.”   Lunsford added that similar sightings came from Texas and Louisiana around 2 a.m. Friday.  He said the southern fireball had about half as many reports as the one over Illinois. Such bright fireballs are common in February, March and April, he added. 
 
“This is the peak time for evening fireballs,” he said. “I have no doubt that it was a meteor.”   Lunsford said most of the reports claimed to have seen a large green fireball, but some were blue or yellow.  According to Lunsford, the seemingly strange colors are actually quite common when a large chunk of space debris enters Earth’s atmosphere. 
 
“Entering the atmosphere excites the oxygen molecules and creates a sort of greenish glow,” he said. 
 
The AMS is still investigating the case, which includes looking for evidence that the meteor metamorphosed into a meteorite by hitting the surface of Earth. 
 
“There’s still a possibility that it did,” Lunsford said.  “We look for signs of sonic booms that indicate that the object entered the lower atmosphere.  We haven’t had any of those so far.”   Social media in the Riverbend was abuzz with chatter about the fireball — or whatever it was — late Thursday and early Friday.  Facebook user Jason Cox wrote on the Telegraph’s wall that he saw the object around 8:30 p.m. Thursday evening while traveling north on Homer Adams Parkway off Broadway. 
 
Another user, Berthal Allsman said he saw a similar object on Homer Adams Parkway and described it as “kool as h—-.”   Mandi Carroll wrote that she saw it while driving on Missouri Route 367 towards Alton. 
 
Most Facebook users that claimed to have seen the object on the Telegraph’s page described it as a meteor.  Others jokingly theorized that it was a spaceship, a methamphetamine lab explosion or popular Star Trek character Spock, portrayed by the recently deceased Leonard Nimoy, reaching his destination on the final frontier. 
 
The Alton Police Department said that they did not receive any calls on the matter. Alton Police spokesperson Emily Hejna speculated that it was most likely not a visiting life form from the far reaches of the cosmos. 
 
The Telegraph also reached out to NASA regarding the matter, but nobody from the administration had responded to the request as of press time.  An official did confirm they were investigating the reports, however.  The official echoed the belief that it was probably not a spaceship.",38.9093,-90.16,03,Spring

Perfect day with no clouds, sunny blue sky , 65-70 degrees warm.  May 5th 2011 5:30pm  I was outside putting a brick walkpath in the front of my parents house, and I heard a very strange airplane flying, I looked up and there was a japanese zero (had the rising sun symbol on both wings) flying directly above my house. 
 
While looking at this plane, I noticed a strange white or silver object in the sky alot higher, and behind the plane.  The object looked like it was leaking water. 
 
I raced in the house to get my camera (sony dcr-trv140 digital 8mm) and my mom. 
 
I turned on the camera and focused on the object.  It appeared to be reflecting sunlight very well indicating it was very reflective.  It was possibly round or sphere shaped and possibly spinning, but I cannot confirm this because the sunlight made it look like it was changing shape. 
 
I was zoomed in on the object to 20x optical, and could clearly see what appeared to be a vapor, or steam, or something leaking out of the bottom of it. 
 
The only thing I could imagine it being is a weather balloon, and the leaking portion just an illusion, quite possibly a long tether?  I recorded as much of the event as I could but my lens fogged up badly due to my sweating face, and could no longer see the object with my eyes.

On approx 8pm, roommate and friends called me out of the house to come check out a full  half circle rainbow, I grabbed smart phone took two pictures.  Switched phone to video mode (5 mega pixles) and filmed the entire rainbowand noted a strange cluster of clouds, I make the comment it looks as if a UFO could come out of that strange cluster of clouds, I capture that it is about :36 seconds. 
 
Here is link to that on YouTube. 
 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBEnAZnFRI&list=UUaKKSNYXQkyNlPH-K6QZjzw   
 
I put phone on standby but still in video mode, and go in to use the bathroom.  Then run back in and yell that I have to come back out and see this it is a UFO,  
 
I turn back on phone, before I go out front door. (Driveway faces South west) As I walk out, I see a very right light up in the sky start record, then watch most of the sighting with my eyes, checking the screen to make sure I had it centered correctly,   
 
What I saw is the light go up, come back down, the strange clouds had disapated, above and below the object, then as it made a slow descent I saw 2 separate lights above a lower disc shaped color of a dark royal blue or purple, almost a blacklight color but brighter.   
 
The 2 light above it which took up 70% of it were very large and bright, with a definate separation of the 2 in the middle. This can be seen on a large screen Hi Def TV. 
 
As it decended it slowed, then as it got lower below the power lines and near roof tops it appeared to be miles away South West of town, I mention Sara Park in the video but my direction is off it appears to be 5 to 7 miles south of town in a desert area. no houses or buildings there, As it got to the roof line the left side appeared to me to flash a very bright red light on one sideas it hovered above the roof line a few seconds then dipped below that and went out of site, The other 3 witness's saw it ascend quickly lower, then rise again, that is when I caught this on video here: (1:36)  
 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFiBEyVuY4I&list=UUaKKSNYXQkyNlPH-K6QZjzw    
 
That was it!   
 
My roommate called the non emergency Police line to ask if any calls had come it. And they had not had any but requested to come see the video, roommate said no...lol... 
 
 my Father was a Pilot and I have been in many planes before.  This had none of the normal markings of a plane. no tail lights wing lights and the lights were too huge to be landing lights.  
 
We are on the south side of the City, the airport is far north of here and it only went up and down in direction.  My roommate said it rose very quickly high at 1st then kept the same speed shown on video.   
 
It was 8:23pm when it was all done.

I went out to walk him and I noticed a very bright light in the sky moving quickly around a small area to the east of our home.  We live in the country and so it was particularly noticeable.  I yelled at my husband to come outside, NOW.  He did and said I was crazy that was the North star.  I assured him it was not.  It was MUCH brighter and in the East.  He said to go get my phone and record it but it was dead so I plugged it in to charge.  I went back and looked at it a couple of times and it remained in that area.  He said I crazy and to come to bed.  Not long after that the dogs seemed to quieten down. Tonight, my husband went back outside and called me out there.  No object was in the sky tonight and he started freaking out asking me why I didn't record it…

I was in the house when he called me to hurry and come outside, that ""thing"" was in the sky like he saw before, but this time to the south (last time was east).  When I got outside, I observed a reddish-orange bright light that appeared to be descending but steady pace.  After only a few minutes, it stopped moving all together.   
 
After only a few seconds, it began to move horizontally to the east and then stopped again.  It appeared to hover while moving a tight circular pattern in each place it stopped.  It would descend and move horizontally west and back east after each ""stop"".  It even made a quick movement back UP at one point.   
 
I told my husband to flash his flashlight, but surprisingly he refused (he has interest in these types of things, watches a lot of documentaries).   
 
Right before it ""disappeared"" it began moving in what appeared to be a horizontal pattern away from us, so it either disappeared or moved out of sight because the light slowly dimmed during this process.  I went back in the house to get my phone to record it, but had the phone focused on the neighbor's light instead of the sky and didn't realize it until it was gone because I was watching the sky, not my phone.

Walked out of my house with my brother and started talking before his departure.  Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a large fireball in the sky and told my brother took look as well.  We both thought maybe it was a plane but thought it strange since the fireball was very bright and not typical of commercial planes in the area.  Living close to a major airport we see planes on a regular basis and can identify commercial planes by there flashing lights.  Once we realized that it could not be a plane with a bright red orange color light we started walking toward the yard to get a better look at it.  At the same time as I reached for my phone to record the event the bright red orange glowing fireball emitted a smaller fireball that went straight down.  A second or less after the first smaller fireball a second fireball was emitted.  Shortly after the release of the second smaller fireball the larger fireball disappears. 
 
We were so amazed by the strange lights that we quickly checked my phone to see if I captured any of it since it only lasted a few seconds.  I did get it on video but only the last couple seconds.

At approximate 10:30 p.m. on Thursday, October 22, 2015 my roommate and I were talking out on our balcony which faces about south east.  I was sitting in a low chair and my roommate was standing with his back against the railing, facing me and the door to the apartment--he could not see the sky.  As we talked I observed a bright light moving across the sky that resembled the profile of a meteor, that is to say the light grew brighter as it moved laterally across the sky from the right of the balcony to the left.  That would put it coming from roughly the south to the north. If the light had streaked then disappeared I would have thought it to be just that, a meteor.  However, about 2 seconds after the light appeared the path of the light curved sharply upward and disappeared. The light did not fade out, it was there and then it wasn’t there. 
 
This was so strange that I stood up and told my roommate what I had seen.  There wasn’t much to say other than I had seen a light moving strangely in the sky. We joked that I was the only one to have seen it and that I now had a ‘UFO’ story that was unsubstantiated. It wasn’t two minutes later that he pointed up into the sky and yelled ‘look at that!’ I thought he was kidding around at first but as I looked three uniformly shaped lights in a delta formation moved rather swiftly and silently through the sky toward the place where I saw the first light curve upward.  From our point of view they came over the apartment building which would put them moving roughly east.  In the interim between the first light and the sighting of three lights we observed five or six passenger jets flying overhead which is common for this area.  These planes took about 30-40 seconds to cross the majority of the sky.  The lights we saw crossed about half of the visible sky in less than 4 seconds. 
 
As the lights receded from us, the back right light broke formation in a non-ballistic motion, curving through the sky much like a motorcycle zipping around traffic, and passed between the other two as all three accelerated and then disappeared.  Just like the first like the first light that I saw, they did not fade out.  They were simply there and then not there.  I had my cell phone in my hand while we watched, however I was so completely mystified by what we were seeing that by the time it occurred to me to try and film the lights had gone. It likely wouldn’t have shown up though, because once I had begun to take video most everything was black except for the brightly lit parking lot. 
 
 I don’t recall the shape of the first light very clearly. It didn’t really gain my full attention until it curved upward. The three lights however were very round, nearly perfect discs of soft white light. They appeared to be very high above us. I could not discern any detail other than the relative size and shape. There was no tell-tale warbling of jet engines nor any other sound to indicate a fast moving aircraft. 
 
 Shortly after our experience another roommate came home and after we told him what we saw, he indicated that he had seen a similar light in the sky akin to the first light that I saw. He was outside and less than 5 miles away to the north west of our apartment. He said that he noticed a bright light in his periphery and turned to look at it. As he did the light was obscured by the little cloud cover that was out. It was strange enough to him that he got the attention of another person next to him but as he directed their attention to the expected position in the sky, the light did not reappear. He did not witness the other three lights.

I came back from the airport at 21:30, pulled in my driveway, was unloading the car and something bright caught my attention.  Initially, I thought it was an aircraft on fire traveling due south at about 5000 feet AGL.   
 
Approximately the size of my thumb nail it came to a hover directly over me and hovered for approximately 30 seconds.  It then backed up roughly 3 arc seconds, moved west by the same amount, and then moved south east by about 4 arc degrees.   
 
The object then started ascending due east eventually climbing over the clouds which were in the eastern quadrant of the sky in approximately 20 seconds.   
 
I snapped a picture with my IPhone as it was ascending and then called for a weather briefing.  At the time of the sighting visibility was 10 miles,  wind 310 at 3, few clouds at 7,500, scattered at 12500.  Temp was 23C, density altitude 5400, and altimeter 3002.   
 
Consequently, based on this weather report for 0339 Zulu for Billings, MT, I estimated the ! rate of climb from a hover (5000 AGl) to disappearing over the clouds at 12,500 giving it a rate of climb of approximately 22,500 fpm.   
 
The object was circular, glowed brightly the color of a campfire, and made no noise.  The color of the object never changed during the 60 seconds of witnessing it.   
 
For whatever reason, I feel that this object was unmanned and transitioned to a hover in order to  search for a navigation data point such as a magnetic field line or point of reference in order to begin a new displacement.",45.79417254901961,-108.5628480392157,08,Summer

Shortly after midnight on the morning of 18 Sept 2011, I was driving south on Interstate 75 heading toward Dayton, Ohio.  As I approached the city of Troy, I noticed a red pulsating (maybe ""flickering"" is a better word) light that appeared to be almost hovering over the interstate.  I first thought it was a light on a cell or other type of tower, but the closer I got I noticed it seemed to be moving slowly to the east.  I'd estimate the altitude of the light to have been no more than a couple thousand feet as I drove under/by it.  There was no apparent noise associated with it, and I'm sure it wasn't a conventional aircraft or helicopter. 
 
As I recall, the weather that night/morning was fairly clear, with just enough haze to allow the red light to illuminate the haze around it with a dull red glow.  As I continued south, I continued to observe the light in my rearview mirrors until I eventually lost sight of it.  I'm unsure if the light extinguished, if it left the area, or if I lost sight of it due to the terrain as I continued south.   
 
Total time of my obersvation was probably 10-12 minutes. 
 
I made a point to check the newspapers and TV news the next day in Dayton (about 20 south of Troy) to see if there was any mention of the light, but found none.  My thought was it was probably a Chinese lantern, but then I noticed the Sept 25 sighting in Dayton on the NUFORC data base that sounded almost exactly like what I'd seen.",40.0414,-84.2023,09,Fall

I realize that the UARS satellite was predicted to have fallen on Friday or Saturday (9/23-24) but I saw something on Sunday night (9/25) that I thought I should report.  Maybe it was just a meteor but it was the largest light in the sky, other than the sun, the moon or fireworks, that I've ever seen. 
 
 On Sunday (9/25/11) at approximately 11:40 P.M.  I was out on my porch and I saw a large light move across the sky.  I only saw it for about 2 seconds before it disappeared behind some nearby trees.  I watched to see it reappear on the other side of the trees, and saw it for an instant through the trees, but before it could reappear there was a flash in the sky.  The flash wasn't overly dramatic, but easily discernable and originated behind the trees where the light had been.   I'm assuming it exploded or burned up or something at that time because it never did reappear. 
 
I live in Phillips, Maine and from my location the light, which was a yellowish white, was moving from north to south in the western sky.  I would guess that it was about 30 to 35 degrees up from the horizon - so not too high in the sky.  The size of the light was the thing that caught my eye. It was large, I would estimate that it was larger than 1/3 and smaller than 1/2 the diameter of the moon.  Another way to describe it would be if I were to draw on a piece of paper how big an average meteor looked I would draw something maybe 1/16 to 1/8 inch in diameter.  Compared to that this light would be closer to a full inch.  There was no sound that I could hear. 
 
 I have reported this in an email to Nasa and also to Linda Molton Howe.  I also called the local sheriff’s department and was told mine was the only report and that they would contact me if they ever discovered what it was that I saw.  It’s been almost two weeks now and I haven’t heard anything back from anyone.  I apologize for not getting this to NUFORC sooner but I didn’t think of it until I heard NUFORC mentioned on a recording of Coast to Coast that I was listening to. 
 
I hope this info is helpful, and if the light wasn't part of UARS then I would really like to know what it was.",44.8375,-70.3601,09,Fall

I keep seeing these things.  On September 23, I woke from sleep, needing to go to the bathroom.  Next to my bed is a large window that faces due east.  When it is warm I like to prop the window open for fresh air, which I had done this night.  Before I went to the bathroom, I took a look out the window as I usually do.  It was clear and cool and many stars were visible.  I saw Jupiter maybe 10 degrees above the horizon to the ENE, Sirius to the southeast, with the constellation Orion above it.  I know the stars, planets and constellations pretty well as I have been interested in astronomy since I was young.  I own a nice telescope I use on occasion. 
 
What was unusual was a bright star like object about 10 degrees above Jupiter and slightly north of it as well.  This object was a bright white color, brighter than both Jupiter or Sirius.  I was a little confused because I look out the window every morning and have not seen this star before. It did not appear to be moving at all.  After about 15 seconds, it suddenly dimmed to a very small pinprick of light, and then dimmed out altogether.  I looked carefully to see if a cloud had passed in front of this star, but it was very clear.  I did see one faint patch of cloud, but this was nowhere near this ""star"". 
 
That's it, that is my sighting.  Not very eventful except that I keep seeing objects like this on a regular basis.  Back in April I was going to work early in the morning when I got the impression to look up, and I saw a very bright light just like the one I saw tonight, which also quickly faded out a few seconds later.  Over the past five years or so I have seen about half a dozen lights like this.  You can't help but feel that these objects are appearing for the express purpose that you see them. I am not a nut job, but I know what I am seeing, and I am seeing these objects on a regular basis.  I have a very difficult time believing it is just a coincidence that I repeatedly look up just as some bright military aircraft or other object is hovering in the sky, and then quickly turns off its lights, or jets away.  Altogether, I have seen UFOs about a dozen times in my life, three times up close with much detail.  But the last few years I seem to just ""look up"" and there they are.  What they are I have no clue.   
 
I am rather religious and do not believe these objects are from other planets, I rather believe they are spiritual in nature.  Still, why do I keep seeing these things?  Most people never see a single UFO in their entire life, I have probable seen at least a dozen.  What does it mean?   Oh well, that's it.  I have turned a very short and unremarkable sighting into something big, but when you keep seeing these things, it begins to get to you after awhile.",41.81389999999999,-73.1123,09,Fall

Traveling in a car, for the entire duration of our trip, we witnessed a super bright white light in the sky.  I was curious as to what it was since it was not moving, but standing completely still in mid-air, too high in the sky to be a cell phone tower.  As we proceeded to get closer, the light, we noticed, was actually 2 spot lights.  At that point we thought it was a plane, the lights being the 2 wing lights.  I began to notice a ""shooting"" type light, flickering from side to side, from one white light to the other.  I know that a plane's wing lights flicker, but they don't shoot across the plane's wings!  At this point, I was sure it was an alien craft.  I kept my eye on this thing the whole trip, and as we came to the stop light, we were directly beneath it, as it hadn't moved the entire time we were driving.  I actually rolled the window down and looked up into the sky to witness yet another light, which formed a perfect triangle with the other 2 light! s, and was sitting still in the sky as of yet.  I said to my friend, ""This is a UFO, an alien craft!""  As I said this, the craft then (after 15 minutes of keeping my eye on it) began to move slowly with the wide end of the triangle as the front of the craft, shooting lights and all, and headed south toward the Monee/Peotone area.  I took my eyes off of the craft and then immediately noticed 6 or 7 more identical lights in the sky around the Frankfort/Mokena/Tinly Park area.  They were the same color, brightness, and height as the previously seen craft.  They looked just like the first one before I was close enough to see the shooting light.

During the time from 10pm until 5am many round yellow lights, that were smaller than the big light, which had been changing positions quickly then disappeared quietly after the larger one left. 
 
During the entire seven hours yellow balls of light would shoot down to the ground continuously from the round yellow balls of light in the sky, one ball of yellow light came quietly from one yellow ball of light in the sky rotating first one and then the next one never coming down more than one at a time.  Each time these lights came to the ground it looked look as if giant fire flies about 2” in diameter were coming down but they never flickered as the light was steady.  When the light reached a tree, a building or the ground there was no longer a light.  The lights came in the same pattern each time, a light to the distant trees on the left, a light to the distant trees on the right, a light to the distant trees in the center, then a light to the nearby trees on the left, a light to the nearby trees on the right, then the rotation started over. 
 
When the large light brightened to orange and darted up after which the yellow balls of light disappeared, the yellow balls of light were observed in the northern sky sending yellow balls of light to the ground in a similar pattern seen over another housing property.

((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) 
 
Dear Peter, 
Need to delete a section from submitted information previously.  Someone saw the lights in the trees seemingly showering from the sky which were thought to be giant tropical fire flies blown northward from the tropics by Tropical 
Storm Bill now in Texas on a northeast bound path.   The next night, June 
17, the giant fire flies were observed in the same wooded area but the yellow round lights in the sky did not reappear.  My apologies for connecting the two unconnected observations.  I found your web link yesterday when I google searched for strange lights in sky over Virginia. 
See below for revised submission. 
Thanks for your reply,

They were nearly directly above the flight path for jets landing at Sky Harbor Airport, and appeared to be at an elevation that aircraft would need to be pressurized or at least would leave a vapor trail.  Although they seemed directly above the flight pattern for landing, I expect they were slightly north/northeast. 
 
My sense were that these objects could have been parachutes as they may seemed rectangular in shape, and since they didn't appear to be moving laterally, that's all I could think of.  While watching them for about 15 seconds, a third object appeared to the east of them but was a bright blue and of the same shape.  This third object reinforced my reasoning for thinking they were parachutes, because I could imagine that being a parachute color.  The only thing that baffled me about the parachute theory was who would attempt, or get permission to parachute in this area with such heavy airline traffic.

I watched it for some time, it was moving from south west to north east.  It looked like 3 balloons tied together in a triangular pattern.   
 
Skip to 9:00PM Saturday, June 20, 2015.  I was talking to my neighbor and he was showing me a bright star to the west of the Moon.  I told him that I had seen something that was strange looking the night before and pointed to the region in the sky where I had seen the object the night before.  Low and behold the same object was was in the sky as the night before and in the same general location.   
 
The object was still visible as the sun had just set.  It looked like 3 balloons tied together in a triangular pattern.  But there was a reflection from the sun reflecting off something at the top of the uppermost ballon.    
 
Size:  From my vantage point the size of the 3 connected objects appeared to be as large as the diameter of the fuselage of a commercial jet.  If you were to look at a map of the Salt Lake City Valley, I would have seen the object directly over the Murray region.  The object was relatively stationary for about 5 minutes, then it traveled west south west until it was in the direct path of jets on final approach to SL International Airport.   
 
Then it appeared to climb in elevation from what appeared to be about 20,000 feet until it disappeared straight upward out of sight moving directly southward over Camp Williams.  The path was in a slow ""S"" pattern.  but the strange thing is the same object was in the sky 2 days in a row.

On Sunday May 16, 2010 at approximately 16:00 I went to a friend’s house by the name of Matt Oliver. The purpose of the visit was to borrow his video camera in the hopes that I'd catch some of what I'd seen the previous evening on video. I was leaving his house with the camera when I looked up North in the sky and saw something appear in the sky seemingly out of nowhere. I can't be certain how to describe its movement but it was similar to that of a jellyfish. After about 30 seconds a second one appeared. I hollered to matt who came out on his balcony and confirmed what I thought I was seeing. They began to move in a easterly direction. Sometimes appearing to drift and at other times they looked to be propelling themselves. It’s important to note neither object drifted the same way as the wind or clouds. We watched them for about 15 minutes until they were out of sight. At that moment a plane that looked very similar to an airliner but painted all black or b! lue on the bottom swooped through from east to west at about 500 feet in altitude right where I had first seen the ufos. Then directly after the plane swooped through Matt began hollering to look directly up in the sky. Over head and very high we saw a number of lights blinking on and off and dancing around. This persisted for another half hour. Also I noticed cotton like substance falling from the sky. I collected some of the material and am hoping have it analyzed. It was very hard to catch these objects with the video camera I was using but I did capture one of them for a brief moment.

I considered that perhaps it was a signal light on top of a cell phone tower or similar but I was not aware of any such construction in the area. 
 
As I got closer and it came clearly into view, it appeared to be triangular in shape and the size of a large plane.  It seemed to hover and didn’t have any speed like an airplane or jet would.  There was also no audible sound coming from it.  Although I did not lower the windows on my vehicle, I feel sure that had it been a plane of that size I would have heard the roar of the engines. 
 
The other thing that struck me as unusual was that it appeared to have search lights on it.  They were very big and round and they faced down, towards the ground, not like the head lights of an airplane.  It did also have a red and green light on it which I understand is used to signal port and starboard on aircraft. I am not sure how many of these search lights were on this triangle as I did not count them, but I would guess at perhaps 6 or 8. 
 
I was unable to stop on the freeway, or to take picture whilst I was driving so I took the off ramp and drove around to where I normally park, hoping I would still be able to see it, however by the time I got around the building, I could no longer see the craft.

Today, May 24th, 1am, I was going through my pictures on my iPhone when I looked to the same picture taken on the 19th. 
 
I noticed a tiny, but notable, green ball, it's a lightening green and perfectly round. Decided to post on Instagram, because until that moment I thought it was a funny thing. 
 
30 minutes before I posted my picture a girl had posted the same thing: a picture of a her view/lanscape, and the same little green ball was there. she also noticed the ball in her picture while browsing her pictures on her phone. Both of us did not see the green ball at the moment when the picture was taken. 
 
Me at least because I didnt stop to take the picture and didn't look to the floor, where the ball is. I remember looking at the sky, that looked nice at the moment, and took the picture.

For a little over an hour and a half this light never moved up or down, but it would move back and forth along the same plane over the field where it was hovering.  (It moved from the east-southeast to the southeast.)  I timed it and it would disappear for three seconds, five seconds, 17 seconds, 23 seconds, and come back and be visible varying lengths of time.  There was never any repeating pattern, and it was mostly random how long it would appear and disappear.

UFO Sighting: Saturday, August 6, 2011; Campbell, CA    
 
Approximately 8:45PM (PST) my friends’ 5th grade son points out an object in the sky that he thinks is a shooting star.  The object is about 317 degrees NW in the sky, according to my iPhone compass.   
 
We continued to watch the object grow closer for about 2 more minutes when we realized that it wasn’t making any noise.  It also appeared to be glowing orange and had a circular shape.  It seemed like it was a glowing fireball.   
 
But as it passed overhead at about 252 degrees W, we realized that it seemed to slow down and the glow started to dim.  As it began to disappear out of sight at 150 degree’s SE, the sphere was barely visible but was no longer glowing.   
 
It took approximately 5 minutes to cross the sky all together.  
 
t appeared to be flying a little higher that a normal commercial aircraft would fly.  We were located in a suburban area in Campbell, California, that is well lit so we did not see very many stars out but it began as a pretty clear night.  This was very bright! in the night sky.  
 
As soon as it was almost out of view, we began hearing aircraft.  First was a large military, twin-engine craft, then a helicopter with a search light then military fighter jets.  Growing up near Moffitt Field, I know the sounds of the high-speed planes. 
 
Ten to fifteen minutes passed and a second bright orange ball headed towards us again.  It had the same bright glowing light, the same directionality and the same silence.  Unlike the first object, military planes were quickly following this one.  A larger twin-engine plane and this time 2 fighter jets.  Noticeably the planes were flying lower than the objects.   
 
Unfortunately, the fog began rolling in from the west and obstructed our view of the rest of the events.    
But before the object disappeared into the fog, we noticed that it had also begun to dim as the first one had. 
 
I’m not a technical person but I did record the images on my iPhone to view later.  As I was recording the images I noted that the object appeared to be the size of a dime in the night sky, where my iPhone video made it seem like a pin spot. 
 
There were 3 adults and 6 children all together watching this event.",37.28103406593407,-121.9570879120879,08,Summer

I am a sober middle aged man with glasses. I haven't been diagnosed with mental illness nor ever had a hallucination, to my knowlege. I was outside on my front porch which faces West when movement in the sky drew my attention. 
 
 I saw a soft white series of lights that looked more like reflections of moonlight than self luminous. There seemed to be two chevrons, one pointed forward and one pointed to the rear at a slight askew, upwards angle, with a distorted, perhaps reflective area between. It blocked out the stars and hazy high level clouds as it passed but some distorted lights seemed to be reflected in the area between the chevrons, which I assumed were reflected city lights. 
 
 It's size was slightly larger than a silver dollar held at arms length.  Within 4-6 seconds it passed from about 40 degrees to the Southwest to 45 degrees to the Northeast where it faded from sigh. It made no sound and there was no way to judge speed or size, other than getting an impression that it was larger than a private plane in size and much faster than any normal aircraft, but I cannot say with certainty. 
 
 There were no standard navigation or running lights and I am fairly familiar with aircraft. I am convinced this was something unusual.

We took video of a shiny Ufo today.  It was one of 3 UFO's.  As my girlfriend and I sat outside tending to our garage sale waiting for people, I glanced into the sky.  A shiny object flickering in the clouds caught my eye and so I told her to look at it. We both looked at the object for about 5 minutes while it seemed to shimmer or flickering the sun light while staying perfectly still in one spot.  I told her to go get her Camera as my iphone wouldn’t be adequate to actually get any discernable video out of. 
 
The one we took video of was Stationary for 20 minutes  in the sky around the same height or a little bit higher than the Chemtrails that were being sprayed at the time of filming.  Looking at it intently we made out two films before the fully charged camera stated running low on battery then the cam died, but we kept watching.  The Object then started drifting northwest very slowly becoming obscured by trees. I walked down the sidewalk heading east and found the object to be still visible from a couple houses away. 
 
We started wrapping up our garage sale and I went around the neighbor hood in my car to go fetch the signs. When I arrived back, I went to go check if I could see if I could see the object again.  I had found it again this time further away than I had last seen it.  I walk back to our original viewing spot of the first on and now in the sky was a 2nd object that looked identical to the first appearing around where the first one had appeared.  I put up a piece of wood and aligned it with the power line as a reference point to see if the object was moving in any direction so I could determine its movement pattern to rule out if it was a balloon or something caught in the upper winds.  While looking at the 2nd object after a minute or two it started drifting southwest at a slow steady pace in a completely different direction from the original object.  As it started drifting I noticed a very faint 3rd object to the right of it that slowly dimmed out after 4 minutes.  Then the 2nd ob! ject that was traveling southwest slowed coming to a stop.  It was at this time while I was observing the 2nd Shiny Silent shimmering object being stationary once again, that a 4th object seemed to appear right where the 2nd object was.  This 4th object seemed a bit closer and started moving at a much faster rate.   I moved off fast in a more westerly direction through the clouds off into the distance.  The 2nd UFO stayed in it's respective spot indefinitely. 
 
Since we had got the original footage and looked at all this action for about 45 minutes or more, we felt we had gotten our fill of these objects.  We cleaned up the rest of the garage sale stuff and went on about our day. 
 
I’m post a video of the first object.  The camera ran out of battery after taking 8 minutes of footage. This is around 2 minutes of it. 
 
Funny thing about this day was, that we had gotten into a conversation with some one whom stopped by at the sale, about 2012 and the new age that is beginning.  Although I believe the action we saw was more related to the Super heavy tandem planes spraying the skies this day.

The helicopter was very low; I would estimate 150 feet off the ground.  There were no markings on the helicopter.  As I looked at the white copter a black oval object flew into my view.  The object was small maybe six feet in length.  I could see the sun glinting off of this object.  The object flew directly at the white helicopter.  I thought that it would collide with it. At the last moment the object veered away. It flew east up over the other building in our condominium complex then quickly veered south towards the Naugatuck State Forest at great speed.  I continued down the hill with my dog to the end of our road.  At that point, an unmarked single rotor black helicopter flew towards the Naugatuck State Forest following the path of the object.

On July 9, 2001 at 10:35 am, I was sitting on my back porch while talking with my mother (facing east) on my cell phone, I noticed an object in the sky. 
 
They sky was bright blue with some random clouds at very high altitude. Basically a bright sunny summer morning. 
 
The object was fairly obvious to notice in the sky because the sun created a shadow underneath the object giving it shape as I was looking up. 
 
I initially thought it to be a high flying bird or hawk approximately 250-300ft above the ground. 
 
But then I noticed that it had a consistant course of direction and was headed my way. 
 
It grew larger as it approached (object was heading due west at approximately 30-40mph). 
 
As it approached, it grew in size and became clear to me that this was not a bird or a normal/everyday aircraft as I heard no noise. 
 
Living within a few miles of the approach path for the largest airport near our city, and an avid military aircraft buff, I knew this was nothing I had ever seen before nor could I identify. 
 
My second impression was that a balloon was let go and drifting, but this object continued to maintain a westward course against a south/southeasterly wind at 10-15 mph and did not change altitude. 
 
As I started to mention this to my mother (while on the cell phone and the object now close to overhead and probably just two to three blocks north of my house) we lost cell reception, and our call was dropped. 
 
I have always had excellent if not perfect cell reception the 7 years i have lived in my town.  This was not normal cell reception as the closest cell tower is only a half mile away. 
 
The object was a very soft triangular shape (roughly the size of a compact car such as a mazda miata or something) and looked disk shpae from the side. 
 
So picture a very soft triangle from underneath the object, but was convex or disk shaped on the roof of it. 
 
It had a slow rotation to it the entire time, it maintained level flight, never made a sound, and did not roll or pitch in a fashion that a tirangular shaped ballon might tumble while moving along with the wind. 
 
It was silvery gray with some shimmer that the sun provided which informed me of the rotation it had. 
 
Then I thought, as weird as this was, I would try to snap some pics with my cell phone camera. 
 
I quickly took two pictures and I continued to watch the object continue it's course until it was completly out of my sight (heading due west). 
 
So I started in the back yard, facing east, and walked to the front yard, facing west, and watched it until my polarized sunglasses (which helped see the object for a much further distance) were of no use and the object was gone. 
 
I then was curious to see what my photos had produced. 
 
There was nothing in the sky that I could see on my pictures. 
 
I had some of the neighboring house tops in as references to possibly size and distance the object, but nothing of the object was visible. 
 
I was then a little un-nerved about this. 
 
A photo expert may be able to find something or I may have not gotten the object into view while taking them. 
 
I honestly cannot say, but I did make an honest effort to capture the object on two pictures. 
 
Either way I was extremely disappointed. 
 
I have never seen anything like it before. 
 
I feel fortunate to have seen something that I could not identify. 
 
Wow.

At 23:58 on Saturday 10-8-11, I was smoking a cigar by the pool in my apartment complex when the security guard on duty came running by shouting to follow him quickly.  When we arrived at a clearing, we saw orange lights hovering in the sky, moving in very slow formation.  By the time I was able to get my cell phone to record the event, we counted 7 objects in the sky.  They seemed round and bright orange and seemed to dim out and disappear.  Duration was about 2 minutes. 
 
Two minutes later, at 00:00 10-9-11, we saw a single UFO moving toward us slowly. It was closer this time. The best description I can give is that it looked like a rectangular orange lantern floating in the sky even though we knew definitely that it wasn't a lantern. It was longer vertically and at the center was a brighter spherical light, perhaps the craft itself. The rectangular shape was more like a light surrounding the craft and not the craft itself. It soon dimmed out and with the naked eye we could still see, faintly, the spherical center moving across the sky. Almost like it turned the light off that gave it a rectangular aura. Then it disappeared. 
 
At 00:05 10-9-11, another single UFO appeared and seemed to float across the sky before dimming out again. Again orange and like a rectangular lantern with a brighter spherical core. There was never any sound. There was no wind, the night was relatively clear with low cloud in certain parts. 
 
When the singular craft moved toward us at 00:00, we could also make out a kind of reflection of white light behind it on the bottom of the cloud. Almost like if one would shine a headlight up toward the cloud. I have posted the videos I took from my Droid3 phone onto Youtube. The cell phone videos don't do justice to what we saw with our own eyes. But at least it was recorded! Here are the links for your review. I couldn't figure out a way to send it via email because the file sizes are too big. I work in sales/promotions at the Los Angeles Times and the security guard was an MP in the army during his tour in Iraq.

I saw them three different times each time and each time I tried to focus on them I was unable to. 
 
When I was reviewing my pictures the next day I saw that I happened to catch the group of objects high in the sky over the city well above the airplane that is in the picture.  There looked to be two groups of aircraft flying in formation.

As my family and I were returning home from dinner, I observed an object in the sky with lights around the edge of the object, giving it a disk like appearance.  I was heading SW on Three Bridges Rd, in a rural area between the cities of Greenville and Anderson, South Carolina.   
 
I first saw the object through a clearing of trees that line the road, directly in front of me.  It appeared to be at least a couple of miles away, maybe 500-1000 ft in the air.  There was an airplane that passed by in the vicinity, but this object was stationary, almost like it may have been hovering.  I tracked it with my eyes as much as I safely could while driving to see if it moved at all.   
 
Having grown up bird and duck hunting, I used trees and other objects in the sky to try and triangulate the location as best as possible.  The object wasn’t moving. I then approached an area that is heavily wooded and blocked the line of sight I had on the object.   
 
When I came out of the area, I saw the object in the same location, then all of  a sudden, it quickly ascended in the sky to the point it disappeared.

Hi Peter. I've heard you on Coast to Coast AM over the years.   
 
I took this photograph 4 days ago -- May 28, 2013.  I was taking photographs in a university botanical garden.  See the object in the sky?  I didn't see it when I took the picture.  I just saw it a few minutes ago when I uploaded photos (including this one) from my iPhone to my computer.   
 
It could be anything, but I'm emailing you because it doesn't appear to be a bird.  Rather, it appears to be disc-shaped and possibly metallic, because it looks like it is reflecting light.  
 
 I don't have the equipment to blow-up the photograph and otherwise make a determination as to whether this is a natural or artificial object in the sky.  Hopefully you do.  
 
This photograph is looking east, and maybe a tad north.  I'm emailing you at your director@ufocenter.com address with the photograph.  I'd be interested to hear back from you if/when you use whatever means at your disposal to enlarge the image and determine what it i! s.

On Wednesday, May 4, 2011 at approximately 9:30pm on my return home from the gym I parked my car in my driveway facing towards the western sky.  I was talking to a friend on my phone when I noticed in the dark bluish skies a stationary changing light.  It was quite familiar to me, because over the past couple of years family members and I have seen these lights.  But, the difference this time was that these lights were much closer than previous sightings. 
 
I quickly ended my phone conversation and ran inside to tell my Father and grab my new camera (Canon Powershot ELPH 300 HS) that I had purchased about a week previous.  Both of us went to the back porch overlooking the Great Salt Lake and Antelope Island.  I attempted to take a still picture of the object, but was unable to capture anything visible.  Not having used my video feature yet, I tried recording a video which I did with much better success. 
 
I recorded six segments of video on my camera from lengths of about 1:30 to 8:00 minutes long.  We both made observations on the closeness of the object (approximately 75 miles from our location).  Because of the closeness of the object we could see a better view of the rotating lights and movement  of the craft from previous sightings. 
 
We could see the distinct rotation of the craft that made it look like a tumbling Rubix's cube.  It seemed to stay stationary in the night sky.  If there was movement it was slight and westward.  The lights on the object changed frequently between reds, blues, oranges and greens.  It looked as though it was moving in a Disco light fashion, very fast and very rapid.  Occasionally the middle of the object would pulsate into a black circle and then retract. 
 
We observed this object for approximately 25 minutes until the light got more and more faint into the night sky.  We couldn't determine if the object was moving westward over the Great Salt Lake or Dugway Testing Center.  But, there were no sudden movements or set orbit during those 25 minutes.  We couldn't imagine this was an aircraft even though the Salt Lake International Airport and Hill Air Force base are nearby.  We ruled out a planet, because of the tumbling rotation and brilliant lights.  It could easily be a drone observing something, possibly towards the Dugway Testing Center?    
 
Whatever it was we have been seeing this object over the west skies of the Great Salt Lake and Dugway Testing Center the past couple of years.  Nothing as close as we saw on the night of May 4, 2011.   
 
I would love any logical explanation.",40.88041494252873,-111.8698632183908,05,Spring

Here in Denton, it's clear skies with a waxing moon, but a thunderstorm in Oklahoma was really lighting up the northern horizon, and I was watching it blaze away as I walked.   
 
My attention was focused on the sky, and as I was passing the high school, I saw a bright green light, falling from the top of sky and down, northward.  A green meteor!  Must be a piece of on-fire nickel, burning green - that's what I thought at first - and then it just abruptly disappeared.  No sparks, no luminescent trail, no after-image.  Then it appeared again, still moving along the same path.  Then it disappeared again... was it blinking?  Yeah, it was blinking.  Huh.  Must not have been a meteor after all.  Then it stopped blinking and accelerated, and I lost sight of it behind the football stands. 
 
What the heck was that, thought I?  An airplane? I've never seen an airplane with just one green blinking light.  Red light-blue light, red light-green light, yeah... but never just green light-green light.  Whuthuh?  What the heck was that?  A drone?  Definitely not a UFO, right?  Well.  That was weird. 
 
I had just about settled down again to a regular pace when I saw a spire of light appear suddenly to the north.  It was long and tapered, like an icicle, and it was either shining up from the northern horizon like a stalagmite, or shining down from the clouds like a spotlight.  I couldn't tell which, but it was moving from east to west, covering about 10 degrees of arc per second. 
 
Now, seriously.  Come on...  WHUT. THUH?  I watched it for about five seconds, in a kind of stupor, until it moved behind some trees and I lost sight of it.   
 
I ran back toward the football field and past the stands to get a better view, but it had disappeared.  I stood still for about a minute, watching the sky and wondering what would happen next... and then the green light appeared again!  It was closer this time, and I could see that it wasn't a single light.  It was actually three green lights, huddled closely together, in the shape of a triangle... 
 
HUH???  I watched as it hung in the air, perfectly still, and then it began to move to the left, accelerating.  It went out again for about two seconds, and when it came back on it was perfectly still.  Then it moved again, to the right this time, and then it went out again.  When it came on again it described a speeding up, slowing down, to the left then to the right, then up, and then a sharp curve downward motion, and then it accelerated along its original path and disappeared.  It didn't appear again.

On the night in question, my girlfriend and I were driving north on Zucksville Road, in Forks Township, Easton, PA.  Around 8 oclock or so, I noticed a reddish orange light in the sky off to my right (southeast) through the trees.  At first, I thought it was the lights from the radio antenna that is located on the top of the mountain, but then I saw the actual radio antenna and realized that that was not what I was seeing.  The first light passed over the car in the sky as we drove, moving southeast to northwest. As I said, it was reddish orange in color, and lacked the flickering nature of airplane lights but instead looked almost like a fireball, with a densely colored center and a lighter halo or corona. It would occasionally 'pulse', growing slightly dimmer and then growing brighter again, and eventually we lost sight of it because, while driving, it was unsafe to try and keep it in sight. We were on our way to pick up a pizza at a restaurant a mile or so n! orth of where we first saw the light, and when we pulled into the parking lot, we noticed there were two more lights moving from the southwest to the northeast. Just like the first one we saw, these two lights were orange in color with a weird pulsing effect. There was no noise, no erratic movement, just a leisurely uniform pace. At one point, they moved in almost parallel lines with one another. As those two moved over the horizon, we noticed again, from the same point of origin, another light. It followed the same track as the first two. We drove down to another parking lot to get a better point of view, and witnessed two more objects following the same course: as one would approach the horizon to the southeast, one would appear to the northwest. All of the objects were of the same color and brightness, with the same pulsing effect. Again, for clarity's sake, there was no flickering or flashing or strobing that is associated with airplane lights, just a slow occasional pu! lse. At one point, an airplane did cross paths with one, and t! he diffe rence between the lights of an airplane and the objects was apparent. To be fair, there is a small local airport nearby, but none of the objects were going anywhere near the airport and they did not resemble the lights of an airplane. I took several short videos with my phone, but unfortunately the quality does little justice to the incident.",40.67462625698324,-75.24733631284916,10,Fall

All lights on this object were red and moved in irregular patterns sometimes the horizontal lights would go then the vertical would flash.

UFO Sighting | Denton, TX | 0230 am *please note that I was unable to take a picture for two reasons:  
 
1. The craft had NO LIGHTS! This was by FAR the most interesting thing about my sighting  
 
2. The craft was flying too fast and the sighting only lasted 6-10 seconds, I was too busy trying to focus my eyes on the craft so I could remember it and rule out a bird or airplane; there was no time to go grab my cell phone, and the picture would not have turned out anyway due to the color-matching of craft and sky.   Taking a picture MAY have been possible with decent equipment/night vision/quick reflexes but I don’t carry that stuff around just in case! Specific location of sighting: On the Northwest corner of Oak and Locust, looking East Witnesses:  From what I know, and please remember the time of night, I was the only person so see it.  It was a fluke by all accounts.  I was talking to my ‘date’ about my love of the sky and how beautiful the stars were.  When I looked up, within minutes of 0230 am, this is when I noticed it and my skin began to tingle!   After the 5 seconds of awe-struck staring, I quickly yelled, interrupting my dates talking to say there’s a UFO right there, but he thought I was kidding, so by the time I had pointed my finger at where the craft was, it either had disappeared or faded into the sky roughly 3-5 miles in front of us (I am no pro at judging distance but it was definitely close- as a side note, I would have attempted to take 380 East in an attempt to see if I could locate it again, but it was 0230 in the morning and I had to wake up at 5 am!  I didn’t think my excuse of following a UFO for being late would have gone over very well.)  
 
Visual conditions: No cloud-cover what-so-ever, clear night, not many stars visible due to light pollution  Duration of sighting: 6-10 seconds of visual, from midpoint of the sky until craft faded or disappeared  Sound: None   
Direction of flight: almost EXACTLY from West to East, this can be judged because the highway 380 is almost a perfect West to East direction. 
 
Shape of craft: between a diamond, teardrop & triangle Color of craft: black, blended almost completely into the dark night sky, but please remember there was quite a bit of noticeable light pollution, which enabled me to initially see the outline and then focus on what was happening. This is hard to judge because this craft almost appeared to be intentionally the same color as the night. If it had been darker out, I know it would not have been visible. 
 
Height from ground: Approximately 500 feet (this is a guess, I am not too familiar with judging distances) – if you were to look up into the sky, the size would appear to resemble the size of 2 thumbs-widths and was not high enough to have been in clouds, had there been any. Wish I could describe this better. 
 
Speed: Roughly 3 times faster than a plane may be seen traveling at the same altitude Size: unknown, however, I would guess  around 150-200 feet long.",33.21286376451078,-97.12269253731344,09,Fall

I thought they were planes at first, and I thought it was odd that they were so close together. I also thought that the object trailing black smoke might be a plane that was crashing because I've never seen a plane move that fast. Soon after the second object passed the first object, the first object (that was trailing the white smoke) glowed very brightly for about a minute and then disappeared. Less than a minute later, the object trailing the black smoke also disappeared. The sky was clear and the trails of smoke came to an abrupt stop. They did not reappear.

The object consisted of three large orange lights, formed in a rather straight line (although the center light seemed to be slightly lower the other two, but only by a hair). Though the lights were not visibly connected by any sort of discernible fuselage, I got the sense that they were each part of one singular craft. The distance between each light was equal. I also got a strong sense that this object was triangular, perhaps equilateral. Moreover, it was quite large; much much larger than any aircraft I’ve seen before. The craft made no discernibly significant shifts in position, neither vertically nor horizontally. It just hovered. Situated over flat terrain, and above a heavily-populated, low-lying residential area, it hung in the night-sky at a relatively low altitude (much lower than planes departing from or approaching Sky Harbor). 
 
I was driving south on I-51 at 10:28pm. As I approached Shea’s exit ramp I saw what I thought was an extremely large (and normal) aircraft off to the west; three large orange lights (what looked to be the lighted ends of each wingtip and nose). I passed the exit and soon lost my view of the object due to topography (a small mountain range just beside the road within northwest section of Phoenix Mountain Preserve, west side of the 51). Beyond this exit, I-51 makes a series of curves through the range. Coming around the last major bend (near Dreamy Draw), I gained sight of the object again. I thought it looked quite peculiar, but I almost wrote it off as nothing special. I continued to look at it as I came around the curve, and finally decided to pull off onto the shoulder to get a better look. 
 
Trees obstructed the view, but I could see two of the tree lights through the branches. I slinked over the center console into the passenger seat, pulled my binoculars out of the glove box, opened the passenger window, and saw that it was definitely no ordinary craft. Since the object looked like it was going to move out of the trees any moment, I waited for about 10 seconds before I grew impatient. I jumped out of the car (with the binoculars) and walked 15 ft up the shoulder (north), giving me a clear view of the object straight west. Three large orange lights hovered over north-central Phoenix. 
 
From where I was standing the object was almost eye-level, but slightly higher. Its distance was too hard to judge, but if I had to guess, I’d say it was roughly 500 yards away. Maybe more. This didn’t seem to be an ordinary craft because: 1) the lights on the craft were orange; 2) given its distance from me, the lights on the craft were very very large (about the size of a racquet ball held away at arm’s length); 3) the punctuated distance of one light from another signified a wingspan significantly larger than any craft I’ve ever seen before; and 4) It hovered (demonstrating no positional shifts). I heard nothing but the traffic of I-51, thus if any sound was associated with the object, it was not heard. 
 
I watched it for about 4 minutes. At one point the object seemed to be coming closer as the lights grew slightly larger. Then the object seemed to slowly retreat, as the lights got smaller and more defined (i.e. the edge of each light became much sharper, less hazy).  At this point I decided to try to exit the freeway and head west along Glendale to get a better look.  Being on a really unsafe section of the road, parked on a narrow shoulder, I decided I best be moving along anyway. 
 
As soon as I left the shoulder of I-51 I lost sight of the object. When I exited at Glendale, the object remained unseen as I drove west to central (about 3.5 miles) and decided to turn around and continue down the 51.  Either visibility hindered my ability to see the object, or the object was no longer present. 
 
Given the size, location, and duration of time the object was visible, I’d have a hard time believing I was the only one who saw this.

It should also be noted that the night and location of observance was extremely quiet.  Took video of two flying together.  Noted also that no wind was present at ground level and sky was super clear visibility.

I again sighted this light from my same location on Louisiana Blvd NE midway between Lomas and Constitution on the west side of the street that I had first reported on 10/24/17.  
It is the same light I sighted and reported to both NUFORC and MUFON on 10/24/17.  It was again changing colors (red, blue, green, & white) while hovering stationary SSE of my location, not making any sound, and at an altitude about the same as that of a commercial airliner. 
 
I go out to my car almost every night around 12:00 AM to 1:00 AM to remove my radar detector from my car so it doesn't get stolen, and I have looked every time I go out there since my previous report on 10/24/17 to see if this light was there.  Up until this sighting, I have not seen it since 10/24, and there have been no clouds to obscure it if it had been there between 10/24 and 11/12. 
 
After my report to MUFON about the 10/24 sighting, I received an email from their investigator informing me there were no visible stars, planets, or other celestial bodies in the sky SE of Albuquerque where the object I saw was located; the person informed me there is a visible star NE of my location, but not SE.  This light looks to be too low to be a celestial body yet too high to be a helicopter or some other such aircraft, and since it is hovering in the same place for an extended period of time, it cannot be a fixed wing aircraft. 
 
I observed this light for 20 to 30 minutes before going back inside.  I first saw the object at 1:00 AM and went back inside sometime after 1:20 AM.  I took several minutes of video of the light.

The dusky light made it difficult to discern an actual shape.  There were three lights on the object; one on the nose of bright white magnitude -7 appearance, one at each ""wingtip"", port side red, starboard side amber, each of similar magnitude to the front light.  At first the object seemed to be a fighter jet at an approximate altitude of 500 ft traveling directly over the suburb of Goleta.  It traveled over the top of our vehicle on a banked trajectory at which point I told my daughter to look up and out of her side window.  She immediately located the object and noticed that only the wing lights remained visible but in a matter of seconds appeared white in color.  There were no flashing lights.  The object's trajectory became due north and, instead of planing off as a typical jet aircraft will do, the object seemed to maintain a strait line up at about 10 degrees and continued due north becoming seemingly a hundred miles away in a matter of thirty more seconds or so.  It eventually curved a bit before disappearing still well above the northern horizon.

I saw a UFO last night over the San Juan Islands in Washington.  100% it was not anything from this planet.  It was a massive, massive ""globe"" in the sky and it was moving slowly down, and changed directions a few times in a 90 degree turn which no man made machine could do.  I'd say it had to be at least the size of a football field if not several football fields.  The glow from it was intense white light and seem to have a glow around it.  It wasn't just moving down like a meteor or anything, it was flying with power, changing directions, down, up, left, and right.  It wasn't too far above the high clouds.  I'm a believer now!  It wasn't from this planet!  I made some videos of it and posted them to Youtube.  Sorry about the shakiness of them, they were taken holding my cell phone, and I was also drunk off my ass at the time.  I googled it and another guy has a Youtube video up as well so it was real as i wasn't the only one who got a video of it!  Here are the links to my Youtube page.

It would be nice if someone can tell me what the heck was it?! 
 
 
((FOUR ADDENDA FROM WITNESS)) 
 
1  It's not a hoax or the moon.  I took the video and saw it for myself as well as my mother.   The thing was moving.  The moon doesn't move.  The moon is also not that bright.  It also moved in 90  degree angles.   It was real.  I saw it. 
 
2.  LOL.  No.  This might be what  you do for a living but it's not that big a deal to us.  I just sent you the report and video because you are the first one that popped up on Google and I thought someone interested in that stuff might like to see it.  Mom is almost 80 with Diabetes complications.  She comes out onto the balcony I think in video #3 and you can hear her getting angry because the cement floor is cold and at me.  You can hear her comment on it for yourself in the video.  I was a bit drunk at the time so excuse my commentary in the videos.  Whatever it was, it was real and very large and definitely moving in different directions.  I think in video #4 or #5 on my Youtube channel you can see it disappear completely and then come back.  The moon doesn't disappear last time I checked.  I only had my cell phone and I guess did a crappy job of filming it.  I'll see if it returns tonight and do a better job.  I'm not a nut job and don't chase UFO's.  I saw something in the sky that wasn't from this planet or some secret craft that no-one is telling anyone about and took some videos.  
 
3.  I'm on Orcas Island looking south.  It was about at 2 Oclock in the sky so would be over San Juan Island, but a lot further out  It was a very clear night.  Clearest I've seen in a very long time.  A few clouds drifting which you see on the videos.  I talked with some of the local stores and showed the video on my phone and they didn't see anything.  I sent an email to Seattle King 5 news and Fox News.  The local convenient store owner said, yes it was a strange looking clear night that we haven't had in a long time.    
 
I Googled it and this guy posted pretty much the same thing I saw.  He says it was in the Seattle area which is about 40 miles maybe by air? 
 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1nqxyEAJ9M&feature=youtube_gdata 
 
But, his Youtube is full of UFO stuff.  So, I'm skeptical.  But, it was in the same night.  Could he be a UFO buff and just happen to see the same thing as me?  I don't know.  It's not possible I'm the only one.  My god, it was the biggest brightest light in the sky that should have not been there and was moving for 30 minutes in directions that stuff doesn't do.  Nothing does that!  There have to be others who saw it. 
 
I'm watching the sky tonight right now.  About an hour from last nights time.  It's a little cloudy now.  No where as clear as last night.  No sign of a moon.  I've started to question, could I have been that drunk and it was the moon and the clouds made it look like it was moving?  I still say no.  Mom says no.  I should have made the camera steady so it could prove the movement.  Tonight will be the proof.  The moon only moves so much from night to night and so in an hour I will see if there is a moon up there close to the same spot.   
 
Thanks 
 
4.  Yep it was the moon.  I'm apparently the biggest dumb ass in history!  I guess the clouds made it look like it was moving.  My apologies.

Resting, sitting on my deck with my dog, a bright flash of white light, lit the southern sky. My dog and I both turned our head toward it and all I saw was a small, very tiny round cloud sitting above another normal looking series of clouds and as I was trying to focus on it wondering if that is where the light flash came from, I spotted something right above that tiny round cloud, Seemingly coming down from west to east at a 45° angle, but tapering off at a stable & straight Westward line of travel. The object was oblong, like a TicTac and either emitting white luminescence making it appear to be rotating as it was flying forward, or it was actually rotating as it was flying forward. There was no noise and no jet stream as all planes we can observe on any given day from here, make audible engine sound as well as jet streams from even further distances than this flying object. It was not storming, nor was there any heat lightning that day/evening. There was too much sunlight for it to be a visible satellite and the satellite tracker from NASA showed none passing by at that time, Plus it was way too low in the sky to be a satellite, and satellites do not emit light.

preface: No, this is not my idea of a joke to waste your time. I have held onto this experience for years and have told only few close friends out of fear of being judged. I am probably going to immediately discredit myself by saying this but at the time I had taken about 100 ug of LSD. I feel like this is very important for me to mention even though I am probably about to be discredited because I have a very big sense that I was ""picked out"" that night for ""research"" because of doing it. This was not my first time doing it, and even though the experience horrified me it was not my last because I wanted to see if my brain would ever ""go there"" again and It hasn't. I am very clearly able to separate the hallucinations from whatever happened to me that night. 
 
The night started at my dad's house. I had just started tripping on the acid I had eaten roughly a half hour before and my girlfriend thought it would be best to move me to her friend's house because I was laughing too hard and we didn't want my dad to question my state of mind. I agree and she drives me to her friend's house on the other side of my neighborhood. Once we both arrive the night played out as normal as it could have for the situation for about two hours. I had brought a dab pen with me and remember all of us sharing that watching to wong foo (or lsd's version of it where time stops and its just a single drag queen frowning in a car staring at you soullessly for an hour(don't do drugs, kids.)) about halfway (at least I think) through the movie I don't know how or why but I go from laying on the bed, to standing in the middle of the staircase with nobody around me. I had been entirely teleported in the blink of an eye. I'm there for maybe five seconds before i'm shot into a different room downstairs in the house, and then eventually I am sucked up out the roof through the corner of the house (It felt like i was turned into gas and sucked through a tube, but I kept flipping and sticking to the sides of the wall like one of those sticky knick-knack guys you throw on the wall.) 
 
From here I am entirely enveloped by a soupy gold/yellow light that would switch from the gold/yellow glow to a more analogue orange glow. I can hear a part of myself say ""this is deeply wrong"" and I am then shot the image of a face right in front of mine. It was almost humanoid but it was entirely translucent and actually lacked a ""face."" no eyes, maybe some small indents to indicate a nose or mouth but it as very subtle if it had anything. The face would have horrified me if I saw it in a movie or dream but for whatever reason I stayed entirely calm. As a hospital frequenter (I break bones a lot) I could tell this was some sort of doctors office. the room was small like a patient first room and I could see about two or three more of these entities shuffling around in the background assisting. I was on an operating table of sorts made entirely out of the same light I was enveloped in before. Somehow from here I am able to see the back of my own head and skull outside my body only It doesn't look like my head at all. The only way I could tell it belonged to me is because I saw them start digging a scalpel into the back of the skull and immediately felt the most release of pressure I have felt in my entire life. This was indescribably the most satisfying feeling I have felt in my whole Life and I don't even know what they did. It felt like they had sent a charge of white light through my brain only to remove more white light, like they had purified something. In this state I am sent back into the enveloping light and hear myself once again say ""this is deeply wrong."" I am immediately transported back to my body, sitting in perfect full lotus pose with my right foot sitting up top. As soon as I look at my right foot I notice a giant white blister on my toe that wasn't there immediately before the experience. I noticed the blister had the same white almost translucent color that the entity from the operating room had. it disappeared within a few days but I couldn't help but worry that contact with the being or the craft I was inside of had exposed me to some kind of radiation/etc. Again, I understand that this will probably be discredited because of my aforementioned illicit drug use but again I strongly feel that I was chosen to be studied/met with at all because of the open state that it allowed me to be in at that time, or to make the story easily discredited (like that one Simpsons episode where Homer got abducted but the aliens drenched him in whiskey so nobody would believe him.) (Again I swear on my mother's life this isn't joke or a made up story.) 
 
when I had returned to my girlfriend at the time and her friend they had asked where I went. they said I wasn't gone for too long but they had just noticed me sitting cross-legged on the floor and got worried about me.",39.5493,-76.123,11,Fall

Out on my deck looking west, southwest, I saw a light in the overcast sky.    
 
Noted that it couldn’t be a planet because of the cloud cover - early evening not yet dark.  Figured it was a plane.  Bright yellow-ish white circular light like the forward light of a plane.    
 
Expected it to be a plane, but after tracking a straight line from SW to NW (roughly) it suddenly ascended straight up.   
 
Saw it move upward for a few seconds and then it disappeared – in front of the cloud cover. 
 
Never seen anything like it before.  Didn't think to report such a small event, but watching a video, I got curious and I see that a number of sightings were reported in my area around the same time.   I thought I had written the date in my journal, but I didn't,  it was a few weeks ago.    
 
I listed 2/4 because of the prevalence of reportings in my neck of the woods then.   Can’t be certain which day, though.   
 
I told my son about it a few days later - he says that was a couple of weeks ago.

I have seen the same lights several times in the past to weeks.  They are in the NW sky from my address.  Sometimes there are 4-5 lights, last night there were 2.  One was white, the other was amber and would turn red and start flashing.  The red flashing light was most visible and would flash and slowly and drift horizontally from side to side making it difficult to video.  Last night, at one point, a commercial jet flew towards the red flashing light.  The light moved over and became very small, and after the jet flew by, the light got bigger again and started flashing red. This light flashes red for a minute or so, stops and becomes amber, and slowly builds up to flashing red again.  I have seen this light in the night sky over the past two weeks as I am taking my dog out before I go to bed.  I've worked in aviation in the military and know this is not a helicopter, blimp, or airplane.  It makes no noise and has no flight path.  It's like it's just hangin! g out.  It's color is not super bright.  It's red like a stop light.  And, it's not a solid red.  I can see lines through the color and it's shape is not a circle or orb, it's shape is very interesting, almost like a winged creature.  Like a giant firefly.  There is definitely something going on that cannot be explained.  I hesitated to report this.  I don't know why others are not seeing this as it is very visible. One other point, it alternates it's flash with the other white light that I am also seeing.

I would guess this was flying over leander from where I saw it.  It made absolutely no noise and was incredibly camouflaged in the night sky.  There was no light emitting from the craft, the only reason I could see the craft was because of the silhouetting of the light from the stars in the night sky.

Had other people look at it and noticed the object.  It wasn't far out, the outside of the object was seen.  The red object seemed to be ""hiding"", and isn't obvious in plain sight.  The time I observed this was around 30 minutes.  
 
The object seemed to be imobile at the time of viewing.   
 
There might of been a small haze at the outline.

Bright. Semi stationary light.  Very bright. Seen no form. Just the light. 
 
I live in one of the last houses in the narrows.  My window faces south south east and can see the ridge on other side of the narrows. The opposite ridge line is only about 100 to 200 above the railroad tracks. Very low for something to be floating or flying.  Only birds.  On the moments before I seen the unknown a flash got my attention to the window which offers a wide view to other side of the narrows. My living room lights were off and was watching t v.   As I was staring out to direction of bright flash a large white- bluish light appeared. My first thought was.  That's not normal.  The bright ""0rb"" seemed to come to edge of ridge line from my point of view.  It then stayed stationary briefly.  Long enough to throw my senses off.  The light or orb moved slightly to the left.  Stopped.  Then moved to left again.  Stopped.   
 
By this time it was blocked slightly by trees on the alley I live on.  But was still visible and bright.it had stopped again.  No plane does! this.i served in air force in viet man and have a great understanding of flight characteristics of both military and commercial craft.  This in a matter of mere seconds had me shocked. At the last moment of getting up and straining to look out window the light turned from more of a bright white off blue too a all blue light.  It then vanished.  I was shocked because for a second I thought the light was from landing lights on a approaching aircraft.  And was coming straight toward me.after the event I thought to myself. The light was too bright to have been landing lights!!!!  I also tryed to tell myself it is explainable.  I have no idea as to what it was. And I was thinking. Somebody else had to see this.  I decided not to call police. Now a few days after experience I went on the net to see about weird sights in Maryland sky's. Was shocked to see that other reports and the same sounding object I had witnessed. That is how I found this web site to report this. Did not know one ! could do that. What are the odds of seeing something like this! outside my window. Scary. This did happen. I hope someone reads this and can interpret what I saw. And why?!!",39.5995,-78.8461,10,Fall

At approximately 22:50, on the evening of Sunday, the 2nd of May, 2021, I witnessed 2, small but very bright lights traveling at a very high rate of speed traveling in a westerly direction coming from over land and heading out over the Gulf of Mexico. At first I thought I was witnessing two meteors as they were traveling much faster than any aircraft or other man made object could. 
 
 I tracked them for approximately 20 seconds in a straight line. Both objects were traveling side by side, in the exact same direction and speed. At that time, both objects made four very distinct course corrections. Both objects made the same zig zag, “z”  shaped movements. First to the right, back to the left, back to the right and finally left continuing westerly in a straight line and at a burst rate of speed before disappearing. 
 
 The speed, distance apart and the movements were identical and did not very from the each other. Due to the precision, speed of the movements and rate of acceleration, I am confident these were a form of mechanical objects that were neither a man made or natural objects.

A boomerang-like shape slowly flew above us in a straight line. It had sort of gray dots, I assume maybe lights along the craft. They were slightly scattered. From where we were, it looked about three times the size of a plane, in a boomerang shape. We had sighted several planes prior to this, none of which going this direction or of that size. I hadn't seen anything quite like it before. It was silent, though there was wind so that could've blocked any possible noise.It seemed to blend in with the sky as well and it was pretty dark out, but we could still make out the boomerang-like shape. I could see a soft glow around the object. I apologise for not being able to put in the time above. But it was around 7:35 PM when we spotted it.

I'm a 55 year old registered nurse, and the second witness is 60 year old retiree/ small business owner.   
 
This evening as my husband and I were driving west on Broad Street, I observed about 8 orange lights in the southern sky.  They appeared at first to look like maybe chinese lanterns as they were floating from the horizon up and eastward toward Columbus.  They appeared to be fairly close, like they may have been released from the Battelle Darby Metro Park a few miles south of Broad Street.  
 
I continued to watch as I had never seen any lights like this.  I wondered if they might have been a new type of firework as this is July 4th weekend and a lot of folks were letting off private fireworks in the area.  These lights didn't extinguish like I would have expected however.   
 
I turned south on Murnan Road and lost sight of them because of some trees.  When I caught sight of them again, they appeared to be over the city of Columbus maybe 10 miles away.   
 
Both my husband and I were surprised by the distance they covered.  We continued to watch as I tried to follow in the car.   
 
From Murnan, I turned north on Alton, east on Hall, south on Galloway, and then east on Alkire.  Our view was obscured by trees during a good bit of this drive, but by the time we got to the golf course we then saw 4 bright white lights above the Grove City suburb just southwast of the city of Columbus.  These may or may not have been related to the 8 orange lights we viewed a bit earlier.   
 
I pulled over into the back of the firehouse parking lot to get a better view.  These 4 lights did some unexpected things--on occasion one or more would fade out and then illuminate again, the lights would move around a bit, combine and then break apart.   There would be 4 then 2 then 3 then 4 again until eventually they all combined into one very bright white light which kind of blinked out.   
 
During this time we both attempted to film with our iPhones but just couldn't get ! it together before the lights were gone.  They were absolutely! mesmerzing like I couldn't take my eyes off them.  We waited awhile, ready to film but they didn't come back- until later that is... 
 
At approximately 1020 pm, I was on my deck watching the sky when one orange light, just like the original 8 we  saw earlier this evening, came up from the west horizon and floated up and eastbound, more toward Hilliard, a suburb northwest of Columbus.   
 
This was followed by a second orange light maybe 20 seconds later and following about the same path as the first.  These both faded as they went upward as if they were going into the clouds. 
 
This evening was partly cloudy, it had rained earlier in the day.  The temperature was around 76 degrees.  There were a lot of private fireworks going off as this is the weekend following the 4th of July.   
 
Our first sighting was at dusk and the second was dark.

I  have emailed another person in the Lee's Summit, MO, area that stated he and his daughter were watching fireworks as well and saw a large ball of light.  He will not comment because he works for GSA and thinks it will comprimise his position.

My partner and I were going for a walk on the evening of Feb 14, 2017.  We left the house at approx 5:45 and began our walk.  We noticed two glowing objects in the sky, seemingly different from anything else we could see.  Immediately I took out my phone and starting recording.  The orbs appeared red/orange in color but were also flickering throughout the sighting.  Moving between orange, red and at times a slight yellow.  As we started to move towards the two objects we were able to see a third.  All three sat there but then the started to move a little.  The one on the left began to move quickly to the left while the middle one stayed stationary.  Eventually the one on the right seemed to ""blip"" out.  We chased the one moving to the left and by the time we saw it again the other two were gone.  After deciding to try and get a better vantage point we ran around and eventually lost sight of the objects. I stood quietly and attempted to reach out mentally.  I remember saying, ""Show yourself to me one more time so I know I'm not seeing things.""  Shortly there after (approx two minutes) objects appeared in the sky again.  This time there was only two. We ran down streets trying to get better views of them.  During this time we observed the objects hovering, moving in a straight line, changing course during flight and eventually moving out of sight.  Overall the entire incident lasted about 15 mins before we lost sight or they disappeared.  Both of us were deeply impacted, myself particularly so. 
 
We also took a fair amount of video which I have uploaded to YouTube.  Here is a link to the main video with all footage edited together.

On Wednesday, March 14, 2011, ((sic.  2012)) around 2pm, I was heading south on Highway 287, descending the hill that is near the turn-off for the Dawson School (and near Jasper Rd.).  Above the town of Lafayette, ahead of me, I could see something rectangular in shape spiraling upward into the air, above what seemed to be the area just east of Highway 287 and the intersection of Baseline Rd.  The bright object was silvery and highly reflective.  It would disappear when the flat surfaces were not hit directly by the sunlight.  When the object changed position so that the flat surfaces reflected the sun, the object appeared to be rectangular in shape, with a tip pointing up into the sky.  The trajectory was in a slightly south and strongly easterly direction and about a 45 or 50 degree angle. 
 
About 20 or 30 seconds after the first object appeared and was ascending, a second one followed at the same angle.  Both objects shone in the sunlight, spiraling (not in unison) upward.  The second object almost caught up to the first object when suddenly, neither was visible any more.  I am uncertain if they entered the clouds or simply disappeared, but I did not see them any longer. 
 
There was a black helicopter flying northward to the west of Highway 287 when these objects were visible.  It seemed to be almost parallel to them, lower in altitude, when they were at their highest points. 
 
When I got to the vicinity of Arapahoe Rd., I stopped and got out of the car to go to a store.  This was just a few moments after seeing the objects.  I did not see any sign of the objects or hear aerobatic airplanes or jet sounds. 
 
I wondered if I had been seeing fighter jets take off from Metropolitan Airport, 5 miles or so beyond Lafayette.  I do not think this is the case, because the objects would have been much smaller at that distance, and I don’t think their shapes would have been discernible, though reflection off them probably would have been visible. 
 
There is an airport in Erie, close to where I was when I saw these objects, but that airport would have been almost directly east of me, and possibly slightly north, behind me, when I saw these objects.",39.997,-105.0974,03,Spring

Sighting occurred at the Vista House Observatory. A friend and I were watching the Perseids when I spotted what I thought at first was a meteor. It was a small orange light almost directly overhead that flashed orange.  I pointed it out to my friend who spotted it too. Instead of vanishing like normal meteor, it dimmed a little and kept moving across the sky. As we watched, it changed direction and seemed to occasionally move in small serpentine patterns in a manner that could not have been a satellite despite clearly being high altitude. We could also see large helicopters working on a forest fire in the region, but this was clearly much higher and only orange. It continued to move at a steady speed and switch directions before vanishing, though it may have been obscured by the smoke. I believe others may have seen this as well because we heard people close to us mention it too. 
 
 I’d like to stress that we saw a number of meteors, satellites, planes, etc. This couldn’t have been any of those. None of them could move the way this light did.

It was about midnight.  The clouds seemed to be moving independently of each other.  Except for one.  It just seemed stationary and there was a bright light behind it.  I wouldnt have thought anything of it but it didnt move or waver at all.  as I passed under it I noticed it just remained where it was.  unlike the moon when you drive continuously moving on the horizon with you.  There was no noise at all and I opened my window to be sure.  Silent.  Couldnt have been a helicopter.  I also know it wasnt the moon as the new moon was January 23 and we are not due for first quarter until January 30th.  I dont know what it was but when i exited the highway...I could still see it behind me in the exact same spot. 
 
bright flash in bellingham area. 
 
A flash of light lit my whole house. My dog freaked out.  At the same time a friend who lives 15 miles away witnessed this same light and his dog freaked out aswell.  I was wondering if anyone else noticed this.  I have never seen a UFO and don't nessasarly beleive in them, but I can not think of another explaination.  My girlfriend has witnessed a similar occurance.  Winter lighting???

Long Duration UFO Sightings:  On June 24, 2013, I was at my friend “Carol’s” house on Sanibel Island – a barrier island just off the coast of Ft. Myers Florida, USA.   Her house is on Clam Bayou, toward the northern half of the island, and is about a half of a mile from the Gulf of Mexico.   
 
What I herein describe is based on notes I had written up the next day after this initial sighting, and several days following, in addition to what “Carol” and a MUFON friend later told me what I was  describing to them, “blow by blow,” on the telephone for a total of just over 2 hours   
 
At approximately 10:15 p.m., we were on the second floor balcony, which faces west and is about 20 feet above the ground and about 25 feet above sea level.  Our eye level was just under 26 feet above sea level.  We saw toward the west an amber light just “blink on.”  Then about 2 minutes later, another amber light came on to the right/north of the first one (see drawing).  These lights were about the size of a finger nail at arm's length, and they were about two fingers held together apart – they were horizontal to each other.  We could not make out any type of a craft, only the lights.  The lights were “solid,” which is to say that they were not like turn signal lights on a car. 
 
The sky was heavily overcast and there was no moonlight.  It rained late that afternoon, but there was no drizzle when this was happening. 
 
We watched the two lights drift together very slowly toward the north for 10 to 15 minutes at the most.  By approximately 10:25, they had drifted behind some trees in the bayou.  The trees are about 50 feet high at the most.  The lights were just below treetop level.  Carol and I both guess that the lights were no more than a few hundred feet above the water. 
 
Shortly after we lost sight of the lights I drove exactly 2 miles (8 minutes) to where I live on Blind Pass, Captiva Island.  From a deck on the water behind my house I saw the same two lights again, just over the top of the railing on the south side of the bridge that connects the two islands.  My eye level on the deck is about 11 feet above sea level.  From my vantage point I estimate that the lights were two to no more than 500 hundred above the water; carol and I figured the same thing from her house. 
 
Based on my second initial sighting over the south end of the bridge, I triangulated where the lights initially were using Google Earth.  The lights were 1.53 miles away from Carol’s house,. 2.16 miles from my house, and 1.03 miles out from the beach.  I can send “need to know” people my Google Map drawings provide they agree in writing not to disclose where I and “carol” live. 
 
I called Carol shortly after I got home at 10: 41 to tell her what I was seeing, and stayed on the phone with her nonstop for an hour and 21 minutes.  I could not remember very well the next day exactly what I was telling her for such a long time; my memory is pretty poor to begin with, and the high anxiety I was experiencing likely compounded the problem.  In addition to that, I’m an early, early bird, and am usually asleep by 9 or 9:30, which may have affected my memory too.  Nonetheless, I saw what I saw and  Carol filled me in a lot on what I herein describe.  Unfortunately, carol, at 71 years of age, doesn’t have the best of memories either. 
 
I watched what appeared to be the same two amber lights for a while before a third light, of the same color and intensity appeared to the right of the first two.  They remained pretty much stationary but individual ones seemed to change a bit in intensity.  After another while they started drifting slowly to the north (to my right, and also drifted a bit higher in the sky.  Then a forth, same-type light came on.  When the lights came on they came they did not just “switch” on, but came on more like turning on a light with a dimmer switch.  These lights were horizontal to each other, but I seem to remember that they were not in a perfectly straight line.  The lights continued to drift slowly to the north, but did seem to become a bit dimmer, so maybe they were moving further away from me and more drifted more to the northwest and out to sea. 
 
After quite some time watching them from the deck on the water behind my house, I walked about 200 yards directly west of me to the beach.  I immediately saw the ones I’d seen on the bayside.  They were definitely very, very slowly drifting from the south of me to northwest (my left to right) and then just hung there for pretty much the rest of the time, about 20 to 25 degrees above the horizon.  I’d guess that they were no more than 3 or four miles away from me. 
 
Then another two lights of the same color and intensity came on to the right of the existing ones, for a total of six.  I had a 6-volt flashlight with me and I started flashing them, and I clearly remember Carol yelling at me on the phone (and she remembers this clearly too) not to do that -  and she was very, very frightened for me.  Whether it was me flashing my light on and off or not, the lights DID go on and off, one or two at a time. 
 
Then I started flashing an “SOS” at them – three long, three short, three long.  Although I did not get the same SOS back, the lights continued to go on and off.  Then a 7th one ""came on"" just a tad, maybe a finger-width at arms length, above the six, toward the middle, and it was a solid white but not overly bright, and just a tad brighter than the others, about the size of your thumb nail at arms length.  I then remember getting VERY frightened and started shaking and told Carol I was going back home, which I did, even though the lights were still there, hanging to the SSW off of where I was. 
 
When I left the beach the lights were still all together in a ""group,"" in a fairly straight line that was as wide as the fingertips on your d held just a tiny bit apart. It was overcast with no wind, and I never heard a sound from them.   At the time I remember thinking that they could not have been all that far way, and as I stated before, my initial sighting of them when I first got home from Carol’s my triangulation showed that they were just over two miles away. 
 
During this time the grouping of the lights would change, but not a lot - I could never make out an actual craft, and don’t ask me why I never took a photo with my phone, or got my camera at home. 
 
When I got back home I could not see the lights over the bridge, so they had indeed drifted northward during this time.  Despite Carol telling me not to go back to the beach, the scientist in me just had to take one more look, as this was what I thought was a once in a lifetime opportunity. 
 
I remember clearly that when I got back to the beach the lights were still there and in about the same place, but I swear on my mom’s grave that I saw a “being” standing on, or floating a tad above, the boulders that comprised the north jetty at Blind Pass.  The rocks were about 200 yards to the north of me and the figure was about ¼ of the way in from the end (see photos).  As best I can remember the figure was very tall – maybe 10 to 12 feet, and it was grayish, according to my very clear memory of it.  What is odd in my recollection of it, is that as a silhouette in front of an overcast sky that was light enough to easily see and differentiate between the Gulf, the rocks sky, it should have been black.  There was a definite head, kinda square-cut shoulders, and recalling it as I now write, it seems that it was wearing some kind of a robe, because of both the wideness of the figure from the shoulders going down to the rocks, and because I could not make out any legs, even ! thought I seem to have thought there should have been. 
 
This is where I really have no recall of exactly what happened next – it was just pass midnight, the latest I’d stayed up in probably 8 months due to back surgery and pain meds I have to take.  Carol told me the following day that I had described the figure to her (and that it was really, really scaring her), and that I had flashed my flashlight at it while telling here that “they were benevolent and that there was nothing to worry about.”  Just how in the world I ever came up with that is totally beyond me, because in my known-to-others belief, any aliens who are kidnapping and abusing us humans can’t be all that benevolent as many claim.  She then said that I said that I thought the figure was coming toward me, that I got really scared and hid in some bushes, and that I got lost somehow until I figured out where I was.  I was on the phone with her all the while (thank God), so I doubt I got abducted. 
 
I do remember telling her (which she corroborated) that I had finally had had enough of what I was seeing and that I was going home to lock my doors and turn all my lights on, which I did.  Again, from my bayside vantage point I did not see any of the lights when I got home.  I hung up talking to carol at 12:13 a.m. according to my phone log. 
 
For whatever reason, I went back outside behind my house on Blind pass at around 12:55 a.m., and saw the lights over top of the bridge again.  This time I called my MUFON friend “Tom” and woke him up to tell him that “honest to God Tom,” I am right now looking straight at some UFO’s.  Tom later told me that I was describing to him for 43 minutes pretty much what I had told Carol I was seeing – that I was going from the bayside to the beach and was flashing my flash light at the lights and that they seemed to be responding, and that I had again seen the bright white light come on for a while just above the amber lights.  Tom also said that toward the end I told him I was looking at the tall being on top of the jetty, and left the beach to come home just after that,  He said I sounded really frightened all the while I was talking to him. 
 
Finally, I have to be perfectly honest and say that I had taken some extra pain medication that evening/night to deal with my back problems, and that they may very will have affected what I was saying on the phone to my friends, as my friend Tom suggested to me, but I do not believe that the pain meds effected my judgment in what I was seeing in any way.  Although I’m a marine biologist, I’m first and foremost a scientist.  As per the title of that UFO documentary, I know what I saw – and would be most willing to take a lie detector test or whatever.  I would love to go under hypnosis to find out what was really going on, especially with that figure on the jetty I saw – so if there is anyone out there who reads this report and is near the Ft. Myers FL area or who would like to come out to our beautiful little Island, just let me know. 
 
NOTE – Since that Monday night, I and four other shark fishing friends had two UFO sightings of a different type of “craft,” and saw for about 15 minutes a very strange glow, about the shape and size of that last little bit of sun right before it dips below the horizon, just over the Gulf horizon (the horizon is 7 miles out, and we figured the light was emanating from 10+miles out).  We all figured that whatever was producing the light had to be absolutely huge (following Wednesday night starting at 9 pm).  We had two other sightings that night, and I had sightings of other types of UFO’s the following four nights.  Since that time it’s been raining just about nonstop.  I will write up the other reports as soon as time allows, and will submit them too. 
 
 Quick update:  I saw the same two amber UFO’s described above (or something almost exactly the same), plus an orange-red one, approximately 6 to 7 miles due north of where Carol and I saw the other ones (no, they were not fireworks).  Report coming soon.  The time frame of all of these sightings so far is about the same – from just as the sky is getting totally dark, to 10 to 10:30 p.m. 
 
Follow up reports:  Wednesday 5/26/13  Sighting #1 - I and four other shark fishing friends were on the beach on the south end of Captiva Island, FL, close to the rock jetty on Blind Pass.  At 9:10 p.m., with just a little bit of light left in the sky, we saw an off-white light traveling from north to south (traveling from our right, facing the gulf of Mexico, to our left).  The object was about the size of Venus when it is full, but much dimmer, and was about 60 degrees above the horizon over the Gulf of Mexico.  It was traveling about two times the speed of a jet liner, but was only about 3/5ths the height.  It was not a satellite, which I’ve seen at least 100 of. 
 
We first saw it to the north, about 35 degrees to the right of us.  It took about a minute or so to reach straight out in front of us, and which point it started going on and off, but not in a strobe fashion.  Each on-and-off took about one half a second.  It took another minute or so reach the same degree south of us as it was to the north of us, when it just blinked out.  I was watching it through 10X42 binoculars and it appeared a little bit orangish. 
 
Sighting # 2 -  near the had two UFO sightings of a different type of “craft,” and saw for about 15 minutes a very strange glow, about the shape and size of that last little bit of sun right before it dips below the horizon, just over the Gulf horizon (the horizon is 7 miles out, and we figured the light was emanating from 10+miles out).

After leaving a local movie theater at 10:45 at night, my wife and I looked up into the eastern sky and noticed a strange, bright white diamond shaped object, traveling along and then stopping in the eastern night sky.  It appeared to be approximately 3,000 feet up at an 90 degree angle to us.  
 
The object then proceeded to flash multiple colors, and move in a triangular-like pattern in the sky, stopping and emitting what looked like a small red light sphere that traveled in a lower altitude away from the stopped object and quickly disappeared from view.

Saturday, 8/24/19, 9:40pm EDT over the West Side of Cleveland.  I was sitting outside doing a fire pit in my back yard with one of my neighbors.  I'm in the West Park area of Cleveland, but almost in Brook Park, not far from Hopkins Airport.  My neighbor was sitting facing the right direction, ENE, to see it first. I was facing N.  She said, ""Hey, look at THAT, behind the trees!""  There was a triangular formation of 3 steady solid red lights.  I'd guess ENE at about 55 degrees on the compass, and maybe 25-30 degrees above the ground.  I think the triangle was pointing down, with the 2 lights on top, and 1 below.  Was so excited, I don't remember for sure, but definitely was a triangle.  She can't recall either. The formation finally came over the trees, but was much higher up, going WSW about 250 degrees and seemed high in the sky.  They were completely silent.  Took maybe a minute or less to transverse the sky, I don't know how high up they were. 
 
I would say the triangle was the width of 2 full moons.  The formation broke up into the lights being side by side  after being just overhead, but a little to the north, and got dimmer and somewhat translucent as it went toward the WSW.  2 more red lights came from the ENE, side by side, and went the same way, then 2 more dimmer ones the same way.  Then my neighbor then said, ""Look"", pointing slightly in the WSW direction, I couldn't see it. maybe my eyes couldn't adjust looking over the bright fire pit, but she said a round red light maybe 20X as big, she called it ""the mother ship"" but she said it was very dim and could hardly see it herself, with the other red lights surrounding it, all moving WSW and just faded as to the WSW she said.  I thought all the lights were faded and gone by the tine she seen the big dim one.  Looked to me on the ones I could see, they were going just maybe slightly north of Hopkins Airport and still high in the sky. 
 
The West Side and maybe downtown had to see it.  I tried video recording it on my phone, but my screen was pitch black, phone not good in the dark.  Later on I seen at one point I got 2 faint dots, what I assume were the top 2 lights, the bottom light must have been hidden by the trees.

When it fell, it left a teal trail in the night sky about 5-6 feet from where it might have been a moment before. It was pure light so I couldn’t make out a shape but my father, who saw the object before me, said the light formed a circle around the object. When it fell I did see tiny specks of silver shining through the flash, not falling but being revealed. In short, it was a circle shaped bright lime green light that left a teal light trail.

On Friday night May 3rd at approximately 21:45 p.m., I was headed Northbound on Gantzel/Ironwood Road in San Tan Valley, Arizona, when I spotted in front of me white/orange glowing ‘balls’ in the sky. 
 
My first thought was that they were a group of hot air balloons that had just taken off.  But realizing that couldn’t be the case due to the ‘glow’ of the objects-my next thought was someone released a bunch of Chinese luminaries. 
 
At this time I realized these objects were heading in my direction…at what seemed to be a fairly fast speed-and clearly were neither balloons nor luminaries.  They were coming from a northeasterly direction traveling in a southwesterly direction and I would best describe them as little ‘suns’.  They were orange-ish in color and pulsated. 
 
I immediately reached for my cell phone and called my sister to see if she could see these objects.  She is located near 7th street and the 101 freeway, about an hour drive from me.  She could not.  As I was speaking with her and continuing to drive northbound- my excitement increased as I began counting out loud to her how MANY objects there were!   When I reached 28 in number, I could clearly see some of the objects’ light’ beginning to fade away. 
 
At this point these objects were flying directly over my head.  I told my sister I needed to hang up and roll some video.  I quickly pulled over on the east side of Gantzel/Ironwood in an office complex, just south of the Banner Ironwood Hospital.  I got out of my truck and started recording video from my cell phone. 
 
What was fascinating is that these objects were not in any particular formation…again-the reason I first thought they might be hot air balloons or luminaries-both of which would have had much of the same random/scattered flight pattern as I was witnessing with these objects.  At one point one of the objects appeared to be moving much faster to ‘catch up’ with another object.  Again, something I could not explain away as anything I have ever witnessed before. 
 
After about 2 minutes of recording video-the camera stopped and I was alerted my cell phone was out of data space.  I quickly erased a prior video and began a second recording.  Both recordings lasted several minutes, and as noted in the audio of the recordings-with the naked eye I could faintly see some of these objects still illuminated albeit they seem to disappear from the video.  Also, as they flew over my head one of the objects lights went out…but against the night sky I could still see an object.  It was silver in color and a rectangular shape.  Their altitude was about that of a small plane flying above.  I watched it continue southwesterly until I lost sight of it. 
 
What adds even greater intrigue into this sighting-is the events that followed. 
 
 As I got back in my truck and continued northbound on Gantzel/Ironwood Road-obviously excited and wishing to hell I had somebody with me to witness this with me, I couldn’t help but feel SOMEBODY had been able to capture much better video than what I had captured.   There was not a question in my mind this had to be witnessed by dozens if not hundreds of people. 
 
I decided to call television station ABC 15.  When I spoke to the news desk-nobody had reported any ‘odd’ occurrences, and they suggested I submit my video for review via their website. 
 
My next call was to the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office.  Amazed- the phone just rang and rang and rang-I hung up and tried it again.  This time after again ringing and ringing-a recording came on and said that my ‘call could not be completed at this time.  Please try again later’.  Of course my first thought is they have been overwhelmed with phone calls and the lines are jammed.  I redialed them again-and again- the phone just rang and rang and rang…. 
 
I then called another news station, and again, got the same response that no one had reported any ‘odd’ occurrence, and they too gave me information on how to submit my video via their website. 
 
Then, I again attempted to call the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office.  Once more, nobody answered the phone.  I then called the Mesa Police Department.  As I was explaining this occurrence-the dispatcher asked in what location this event occurred, and I told her San Tan Valley.  She then stated I would have to report the incident to the proper jurisdictions department-the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office.  After explaining I had tried numerous times to contact them, she seemed to allude to the fact I miss dialed or had the wrong number.  I told her I had the correct number.  The dispatcher then informed me she would patch me through herself to the P.C.S.O. 
 
Again, nobody answered the phone.  I tried several more times with the same outcome. I placed calls until approximately 23:15, and never did anybody answer the phone.  (I am attempting to get a report from the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office on their call logs for that evenings dispatch.  It has proven to be a difficult task.)  At this time I was approaching Guadalupe Road, when  three police units passed by me in the southbound lanes of  Ironwood with full lights and sirens and driving at least 100 mph.  For some reason I couldn’t help but think this was somehow related to this sighting. 
 
The next day I was up early and scanned the television stations for any possible news reports of any ‘UFO’ sighting.  To my surprise-I flipped to ABC 15 just in time to hear them say something about all the sightings on the WEST SIDE (I am on the EAST SIDE) of a possible ‘UFO’.  After returning from a commercial break the reporter explained that these reports were actually people witnessing a ‘solar plane’ that was in the area and that they could head to the stations website to see more footage of this craft. 
 
Immediately I couldn’t believe it!  Was this a cover up???  Surely dozens…hundreds of people saw this event!  Are ‘they’ really going to explain it away as a solar plane??  In fact, a solar plane might very well have been the culprit to what some people saw.  It is NOT what I saw. 
 
In disbelief and to amuse myself, I then went to the television stations website and viewed the ‘solar plane’ that many reported as a ‘UFO”. 
 
Let me clearly state  that what I saw was nothing close to what people might have seen with this ‘solar plane’.  NOTHING CLOSE!!  Since that date I have searched online for any report from that same evening, from anybody that witnessed the same event I did..  I found only one link matching the date of May 3rd 2013-and that was from a person that apparently witnessed this ‘solar plane’. 
 
Again, this is not what I witnessed.  I hope you take the time to review my two videos taken from that evening. 
 
FOOTNOTE:  On the drive home the other evening I caught a few minutes of the radio program ‘Coast to Coast AM’.  To my shock they were discussing the numerous reports from across the country of this same type of sighting and prompted people to write in if they had a similar experience themselves.

If I would have blinked, I wouldn't have seen it either.  It lasted only a split second.  I saw a large fire ball with a long flaming tail trailing off the end, zooming toward the earth at about a 60 degree angle.  It was silent, and I lost sight of it when it went down behind some trees in the distance.  I've never seen anything like it before.

Some multiple times 
 
This happened around 2013. I know it was chilly as I was outside in the evening.  I have never reported it or told many people, not because of their reaction, but because it scares me, and I'm scared that acknowledging it will cause it to happen again or some kind of different event.  My hands are sweating even drafting this up.. 
 
 It's pretty straight forward.  I was outside looking up at the sky.  I've watched the sky since I can remember. Since very little watching for shooting stars etc.  It was dark.  My first thought was maybe it was geese but it quickly changed. 
 
 I saw the point first.  It looked like a satellite.  It wasn't flashing like a plane.  But also was too low to be a satellite, too far to be geese. And then more followed, in the shape of a V. 
 
 I thought ok not geese, maybe airplanes, fighter jets flying together? UNTIL it just flat out STOPPED.  And after being stopped they all crossed in different directions.  One on the lower left went extremely quickly to the upper right but way out passed where the one was on the upper right.  One on the right zoomed over to the left but way out of formation.  They all did this and were able to just INSTANTLY stop in spots after going so incredibly fast, and then go in a totally different location and stop.  Until they were all out of the v formation at random spots and then all took off into different directions.  A few even zig zagged a couple times across the v formation that they showed up in but had the precision to just up and stop at these random spots in the sky, and then go in a totally different direction, stop, and then they all took off outward in different directions. 
 
 No smoke trails. No flashing lights.  Like that stay white satellite color when they are really far away, but this wasn't that far away... 
 
 Scariest thing I've ever seen.  Can't describe how scary it still is.

A UFO sighting with photo and video evidence.  There has to be a rational explanation for this sighting.  I'm sure there is.  And I'm really curious to identify it. 
 
I'm in Valencia, CA.  After midnight on March 27, 2010, I came upstairs and immediately noticed a blue light (like a huge glowing LED) emanating from outside the large window in the baby's room.  Looking outside, I could clearly see three rows of brilliant blue lights hovering low to the ground over the mountains -- perhaps a mile away.  I had an eerie sensation seeing this unidentified object, as I had never seen anything like it before.  The mountains are free of houses or any man-made structures, so it was completely out of place and very prominent. 
 
I immediately ran to grab my Sony Cyber-shot.  After taking a few pictures, I tried to take a video, but it was not very clear.  So I ran downstairs and got my Panasonic DVX-100 and started filming with that.  The video doesn't begin to do it justice, but at least it's something.  You can see a blue-lit object just hovering there.  From what I could make out, there were 3 rows of brilliant blue lights and one pulsating red light at the top in the middle.  (You hear me describe this on the video.)  There appeared to be slight movement or rotation, but I can't say that with any certainty. 
 
After the camera battery ran out, I watched the object for a few more minutes and then went back downstairs and tried to convince myself that there was a rational explanation.  I came up fifteen minutes later and the object was still there.  Went to bed soon after, so I'm not sure how much longer it stuck around.  Kicking myself for not continuing to watch, but quite frankly, I couldn't quite believe what I was seeing.  It was only the following morning when I reviewed the footage that it really began to sink in. 
 
To be certain, I recorded video out the window at the same time the following two nights, but no lights appeared.  I searched around online to see if anyone else reported a similar sighting.  It looks like there were two other reports on or around March 27 -- one in Tracy, CA and one in Blue Lake, CA.  Specifically, I believe both of those reports also cited the pulsating red light atop blue lights. 
 
I have both video and pictures of the object.  Happy to upload or provide original footage if it's helpful.  Would appreciate any info.",34.41746789772728,-118.54913011363637,03,Spring

At 9:40 pm on 1-08-12 I was at home watching TV and my peripheral vision caught a red glowing ball approximately 30 degrees above the horizon in the north / northeastern sky through a window on the east side of my house. The object was visible for about 4 minuets as it climbed at a steady rate to approx 50deg above the horizon directly east of my home. At that point,  the ball began to grow fainter and appeared to change direction and go vertical or turn 90 deg away from my position until the light faded to nil 5 seconds later.

This may be nothing.  But I wanted to report it to corroborate in case others report it also.  I drive every morning from Newberg, Oregon, on Wilsonville Rd. to the I-5 on-ramp in Wilsonville.  This is a country road about 12 or so miles with many curves and heavily forested.  There are no sidewalks or safe places to walk.  There are many houses off the road and usually the owners are the only people you'll ever see standing on the road waiting for cars to clear so they can cross and check their mailbox.   
 
Today, about a few hundred yards before the Ladd Hill Rd. stop sigh and intersection I saw two strange looking ""people"" walking east along the road towards Wilsonville, i.e. in the same direction I was going.  Both were tall and thin enough to notice, in other words maybe 6'2"" or 6'3"".  Both wearing black calf-length boots and brown close-fitting clothing with what appeared to be dark colored jackets.   
 
As I came up on them they seemed to be walking with a strange sort of gait.  (I'm pretty sure this is not just my imagination) I was not driving fast but I seemed unable to get a good look at their heads (almost like they were blurred) and as I drove past them and looked in my rear view mirror they actually seemed to turn their heads so I could not get a look at their faces!  This all seemed unusual to me.

I was standing in my bathroom looking up at my skylight staring at the blue sky and out of nowhere appeared a triangle shaped aircraft. I'm assuming it was triangle shaped because of the pattern of dim amber lights that were visible. It was moving in a linear direction, west to east and passed right over head. It reminded me of the International Space Station and how it passes over head than a few seconds later it's gone. Only problem being it was daytime so it couldn't have been the ISS. I felt like it was at an altitude higher than a commercial airliner can fly. The speed it passed by it must have been going pretty fast depending on the altitude it was traveling at. Definitely was not an airplane. I've seen quite a few jets and this wasn't anything close to a commercial jet. The triangle light pattern was unmistakable.

Military, and civilian. 
 
I was Discharged “Honorably” as a Non commissioned officer. 
 
Because of my background, I’ve lived life with my eyes trained on the sky. 
 
Approximately two months ago while walking from my house to my vehicle. 
 
I looked up briefly and scanned the sky. Taking pause for a moment on a section between a cloud formation, and at A 20- 25,000ft range slightly southwest of my position. 
 
I immediately spotted a single black dot with absolutely no identifiable characteristics. Clearly this wasn’t any conventional aircraft I’m am familiar with. 
 
This dot caught my attention as it moved out from the cloud for 2 seconds, and then reversing course immediately going back into the cloud. 
 
The object continued with this behavior 3 times before a second object of the same size and shape followed it into the adjacent cloud formation. These radical movements simply could not have been accomplished by any aircraft I’m familiar with. The speed with which they moved at that altitude was astonishing. 
 
I honestly never thought I would see anything in the sky that I was unable to explain to some digress. 
 
I did however. 
 
I believe my military background, and experience Lends a great deal of credibility to my opinion.

I’m an amateur astrophotographer. I had just set up for another round of exposures on the Orion Nebula. I had stepped back from my imaging rig while it ran and was viewing Orion with a smaller hand held refractor. 5 relatively dim lights in an almost straight line passed into the view of my scope. It was odd, so I tracked it by hand all the way to the horizon where I lost sight of it. I spend at least a couple nights a week imaging deep sky objects. I’m used to seeing planes, satellites, meteors, and other normal things. This one was different. The lights were too dim to be a  normal plane, way dimmer than stars.  They were dim, but seemed large, like they were closer than a satellite would be.  They would have been too dim to see with the naked eye though.  They were not in a perfectly straight line, but stayed the same distance from each other. So I’m assuming they were part of the same object.  All five lights were the same size, shape, and brightness.  I woul! d describe them as a really dim orange or brown color. They traveled across the sky about as fast as a plane would. I am aware of Elon musk’s star link satellites, but I’m pretty sure that isn’t what I saw.

 I estimate the number of lights to be around 35.  The line was made up of dimmer white lights toward the front and 4 brighter white lights toward the back of the line. The dimmer lights had a small oval appearance. The larger 4 lights looked similar to that of a satellite. 
 
 While watching, I did not see any change in the number or color of lights.

While walking back to our beach house from a night of ghost crabbing I looked into the sky and saw a set of round orange lights floating in the air parallel to each other.  Naturally my first thought was “that’s neat they are now using orange for the headlights of airplanes”; this was cool enough to alert my friend.  When the lights disappeared I believed the “airplane” to have passed behind some low clouds.  Momentarily the lights came back on, now both of us being witness to the event; we were awe struck by the new orange plane lights.   
 
Suddenly three more sets of lights each identical to the first and parallel to the ocean, separated from the first set.  Now there are four sets of two lights each, each pair moving independently from the rest.  The sets of lights are identical to each other.   
 
Suddenly all four sets of lights disappeared at the exact same time leaving the night sky as pitch black as it was previously.

At about 3:00 am, 18 October 2011 I witnessed a blinking object above me.  I thought it was a high flying plane but then noticed it was stationary.  It stayed in the same place for about 12 minutes before I decided to video the object with my cell phone.  It would flash periodically, in a random sequeance.   
 
There were other lights around the object one flashing red the other a deep blue light.  
 
After filming I froze the video and extracted each frame where the object had flashed.   UFO is all I can think of.  
 
I have some VERY interesting pictures and video and would like it analyzed with better equipment.  The object has mass and is not a star or planet.  It is communicating with lights around it. The video is to big to send by email therefore I will send the extracted frames for you to anaylize.

But the sun was still up and it was still daylight for another hour.  I wondered what planet it was, as it was almost directly overhead.   
 
I took out the telescope and when focused, discovered it was moving very slowly.  It took about a minute to move across the lens frame.  I kept moving the telescope to keep it in sight.  It travelled very slowly in a southern path along the pacific coast.  It had to be at a very high orbit to move that slowly.  We watched it until dark, when it disappeared by getting smaller, presumably by gaining altitude.  The lights were not visible to the naked eye, because the object was too high.  The focused image in our small telescope appeared with the distinguished bright lights in an arc along the top, and dim along the bottom.  The image in the center changed form, but generally resembled a T.  The base of the T pointed in different directions, from straight down to about 4 o'clock.  The lights did not move at all, the sphere did not appear to rotate.  It was a perfect sphere shape, there were more details on the surface that were changing or indistinguishable, not drawn here.

On the evening of 11/16/13 at approximately 22:00 to 22:30 hours, I was sitting on my bench in my back yard with a friend of mine just hanging out and discussing life events.  The bench faces West, I was sitting on the South end facing north while he was on the North end facing south when I noticed something in the sky behind him, to the North.  It was a sphere shaped, bright orange glowing ball that moved rather slowly as compared to aircraft observed in the area.  I never wanted to post about this before, but since this is the third time I've seen this phenomena this year, I decided to research to see if I was the only one who is seeing these things and now I’m here telling my story, reluctantly due to my profession. 
 
My first sighting took place on New Year’s Eve of this year and there were six objects that night, of the same description as previously mentioned but they appeared to be traveling in formations of two.  The first two came from the south at a very high rate of speed, moving north; one behind the other, at the same speed then appeared to stop over us, at the same time, almost like they were attached.  When those two stopped, two more came from the south in the same manner, appeared to be the same distance apart from each other as the first two and actually moved on a slightly north, north westerly direction and slowed to a stop while the third set came from the south in the same manner as the other two sets but was even more slightly to the north westerly direction and slowed to a stop as well.  By this time I had everyone’s attention to them and the objects slowly disappeared over us, all at the same time.  It was witnessed by almost everyone at my house that night, approxim! ately 8 to 10 people and this whole incident occurred within approximately 30 seconds. 
 
The second sighting, I had only seen one of them but it was traveling south at a very high rate of speed and I watched it until it disappeared in the horizon.  I was the only one who observed that one and I didn't think anyone would believe me but this sighting only lasted approximately 3 to 5 seconds.  Please note that the directions listed are approximate or in that general direction.  I hope I didn't confuse anyone with the details.  I would also like to add that I did see a Chinese lantern one night a few months ago that someone launched from the next street over from me and the lights I saw did not resemble the characteristics of the lantern at all.  The lights I saw were much much brighter and didn't flicker like the lantern did. 
 
The only photo that we had was from a cell phone and was not very clear or showed anything more than a stationary light. 
 
I tried to include as much information as I could remember or even describe in this report.

I do not know if what I saw was from somewhere other than earth or not, I only know it was unidentifiable by me.  I have searched everywhere and cannot find an explination for it.   
 
My incident happened as follows:  I parked my car and got out to walk into work.  I immediately saw a very large, white static light coming out of the west.  Too large and bright for anything I had ever seen before.  I don't know how far away it was when I first saw it, but, I knew it was coming right at me.   
 
I kept walking through the parking lot towards the door because I was a little scared.  As it got closer I could see a slow blinking green light on the left (if I would have been in the craft it would have been on the right) and slow blinking white light on the right.  It then went directly over my head.  There were four large static bright round white lights underneath.  They almost looked as though each of the lights were made up of two half round lights.   
 
The lights were positioned like there would have been one in each corner of a rectangle.  I could not see the shape of the craft.  I was desperately trying to, but between the  bright lights from the craft and the light at the door I was standing at I couldn't see a shape.  Plus it was also completely cloudy that morning so there was no light above it.  There are large trees there, probably 60 to 70 feet tall.   
 
I estimate the craft to have been 700  to 800 feet up.  It was not flying high.  What freaked me out most was the lack of noise.  It was a very soft sound of air moving as it flew above me.  As it moved away, I saw a slow blinking red light.  It moved in a straight line towards the east.  It never made any erratic moves.   
 
That's what I saw and I would love to know what it was.  I can't stop thinking about  it. 
 
((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) 
 
Four large white lights on bottom flew directly overhead 
 
This is an addendum to the report I submitted around 10:15 this morning (1/28/16).  This was not a small object like a toy drone.  I estimate by the height it was flying and the space between the four lights that it had to be at least 50 feet long and 25 feet wide, at least where the lights were mounted.  How much bigger than that it was, I don't know because I couldn't see a shape.   
 
Please if you have any questions or  know what this was please email me.

I went outside on the deck to have a cigarette like I normally do at night.  I'm always looking into the sky in hopes of seeing a meteor which is quite common, sometimes several each night.  This night was different. 
 
Out of the corner of my right eye (north) I'm facing west, I see a blur.  I will do my best to describe it...it was circular in shape, very large and very high, no noise, and moved incredibly fast in a straight line.  The only thing I can think of is it had a type of cloaking device b/c basically, it looked like a very fast moving circular cloud.   
 
I tried to discount it as a comet, couldn't be-no tail, cloud remained in perfect shape as it sped from the north to the south across the sky and what looked like into space.  I believe it WAS in our atmosphere and than moved into space out of sight.  I've never seen anything move so fast in my life...and I was Air Force.

19 March, 2012  On the evening of March 18th I had just returned from Sunday night Mass.  I got home at approximately 1930 hours and decided to take my Boxer dog Raja for a walk.  We walk a big loop of about 1.25 miles.  Toward the end of our walk in Niceville Florida we were coming down the hill on 27th street just past the Mormon Church.  We were coming from the east and facing west. 
 
About one hundred yards before reaching the corner of 27th Street and South Cedar Street I suddenly saw a large ball of fire rise from the tree line.  I continued walking toward it assuming it was a small airplane from the aero club on Eglin AFB.  However, I began to notice it was just hovering there silently—perhaps about one thousand feet or so above the tree line.  It was amber in color and just a big ball of pulsating light. It didn’t blink in or out—but pulsed. 
 
I have worked on aircraft for 31 years for the federal government.  I also hold an FAA A&P mechanic’s license. I have seen many things in 31 years on flight lines all around the world. But I never saw anything like this. 
 
What struck me was that this thing rose suddenly out of the tree line and hovered for a minute. It was completely silent. It had no standard aircraft lighting, no wing tip lights, no anti-collision or beacon light, nothing but its pulsating amber color. 
 
After hovering for a minute it turned toward the north east and moved slightly faster than a small propeller aircraft, but much faster than a blimp could go. I believe it was between one or two thousand feet in altitude. As it moved north east it began to shrink down to about half its original size. I lost sight of it behind a large oak tree hanging over South Cedar Street a couple hundred yards to my right. I walked briskly in that direction but by the time I got there it had disappeared from the sky. 
 
It flew at about a 45 degree angle when it cut across south cedar heading north east. I know it went past the high school on John Sims Boulevard (Highway 20) before it disappeared. As bright as it was it seemed as if it held all its light internally. There was no light reflection on the pavement—even though at 22:00 hours it was completely dark outside. 
 
An elderly lady was sitting in a lawn chair on her porch at the corner of South Cedar and 27th Street. When I saw her I asked, “What is that?” She said I don’t know but it rose up from the tree line. I told her it’s not an aircraft because it’s completely silent. She said “maybe the base is experimenting with something.”  I said I don’t think so. I work out there and have never seen anything like that.” She then said, “Well two of us saw it.” That’s when I went north on South Cedar Street chasing after the silent light. When I came back the elderly women had gone inside. The object initially appeared about one third the size of a full moon. It hovered for about one minute and was visible for maybe one more minute after it shrunk to about half its original size and headed north east.",30.515,-86.4844,03,Spring

Pensacola, Florida, June 7,  201,8 1:45-1:55 am  I was at the intersection of US98 and S 72nd Ave, facing south at the traffic light. 
 
I saw a light behind the traffic light, and ignored it because it resembled a spot light on a helicopter, and there's much military and civilian air traffic due to nearby bases and airports. 
 
I looked again, while waiting for the green light, and noticed the distant object hadn't moved, and didn't have strobe or nav lights.  I squinted to see it better and realized it was a very strange object.  It was about 30° or less off of the horizon, and just west of due south from my location. 
 
I turned right instead, to get closer to the object. I pulled into a parking lot at 7575 W Hwy 98, and was directly north of the object.  The area it was over was mostly wooded, I was afraid if i drove any closer I might miss it. 
 
At this point it was nearly 45-60° overhead, and was extremely bright.  It was the size of a fingernail at arm's length, it was a clear sky and no reference point made it difficult to discern the size.  My best guess is that it was a 1-2 thousand feet away, and appeared to be between the size of a car and a bus, but i really don't know for sure.  It was ""smaller"" than a full moon, maybe 60% of that size. 
 
I jumped out of the car and immediately took a cell phone video, but could see the aperture was too small on the cheap camera and there wasn't enough light to see it on the screen.  I tried taking several unsuccessful still shots, but it was still too dim/small, and didn't show up.  I gave up after 3 shots, and focused instead on observing the object. 
 
It wobbled around, much like a top but very small movements.  It also seemed tethered because it stayed in one spot while wobbling. 
 
The colors were hard to determine because of the luminosity of the surface, and also there were dark areas that seemed to indicate it was rotating.  It was mostly yellow/orange/pink, the dark areas seemed blue or green, but they were distant and moving. 
 
It was shaped almost exactly like a queen's crown, it was rounded like a muffin on top, but had a ring underneath, like the headband on a crown.  There may have been something on top, like a point, or it may have been light glare from the object.  The dark areas were on the sides, like panels or windows. 
 
I considered it may have been a Chinese lantern, or maybe a quad copter, or some type of prank drone. 
 
It was totally silent, I have heard how noisy drones typically are. 
 
I started to shout at it after a minute or two, to see if it would do anything.  Maybe a minute later, a very bright red light just appeared on the 10:00 position of the object, it was a pinpoint of intense really red light.  Astonished, I began to flash my phone flashlight off and on at the object. 
 
The red light ""grew"" upwards into a equally bright red line, like a car antenna popping up.  The line was no bigger than the object itself.  It remained a line for maybe 30-60 seconds.  Afterwards, it retracted upwards to return to a single point of light, now with more space between the original object and the red light, but still very close. 
 
It remained stationary, when suddenly the objects drifted south.  As the objects started to move they looked like they went into a thick, invisible fog.  There was no cloud, they just vanished/faded into a smoky oblivion.  The entire process was about 10 minutes or less.",30.45103896353167,-87.24911285988483,06,Summer

Hello Peter, 
 
Your hunch probably is correct. 
 
The Sentinel 2A satellite was launched on a Vega rocket from the Guiana Space Center, last night at 9:52 PM EDT (Jun 23 
01:52 UTC). 
 
Coverage of the launch was here: 
 
http://spaceflightnow.com/2015/06/22/vv05-mission-status-center/ 
 
SeeSat-L received several reports of sightings near 23:49 EDT (3:49 UTC), of what appears to have been exhaust from the final burn of the Vega rocket's AVUM liquid fueled upper stage. That burn lowered the perigee to ensure that the object decays from orbit within a reasonable time, in order to curb the growth of space debris.

The first 6 objects were about the size of a tennis ball.  They would appear and disappear at the same spot above the horizon.  They would appear and disappear about 1 to 2 minutes apart and within 5 degrees of each other.  They did not rise and fall like throwing a ball into the air.   They appeared 7 different times.  The orange objects appeared to be very far away (50+ miles).   
 
During the middle of the appearances I heard and felt a sonic boom.  It shook our house.  That was the only noise I heard. 
 
The last time the bright orange light appeared it was much closer and 20 degrees above the horizon and moving slowly Southwest to Southeast.  It first appeared about 235 degrees in the southwest.  This time I could see behind the bright orange sphere a long tail of orange embers trailing behind.  The embers didn’t appear to be falling but they just trailed off directly behind the object sort of like a comet.  This time the light was pulsating for 10-12 seconds and then it went dark.  It was about the size of a basketball thus it appeared much closer and brighter than the first 6 sightings. 
 
I called the Iron County Sheriff’s office to report it and see if anyone else had seen it.   Apparently I’m the only one who observed it.

The object I observed not quite sure what it was it had red and white lights it was really bright white light with like a tail behind it like a comet and it stopped and just stood in place for a few seconds like a helicopter and all of a sudden it's shot back from the right to the left again for approximately I don't know I guess a few miles stop steel again and then shot straight up and disappeared at first I thought it was a falling star when I first seen it but a falling star does not stop in mid-air and start over I sent you three pictures I hope you got them was not the clearest pictures but one of them you can see the tail behind it again this was 15-20 miles west of Prescott Arkansas on Interstate 40 halfway between Little Rock and Memphis Tennessee I told the other guy that was running with me that start with me to send a report he said he would before the night was out I hope you can make heads or tails out of the pictures I tried to zoom in with his cell phone as good as I could but as I said I'm not the best with technology God bless you and have a great weekend oh I meant to say when it stopped it kind of had a reddish tint to it like a reddish light then turn to bright white light like somebody turned a spotlight on you but it was a long ways away of course it was just not right on top of me but it was a distance and you can tell it was close enough I got that photo",33.8034,-93.36809999999998,11,Fall

One single flying object approached myself (a non local) and another local hunter immediately after leaving hunting stands in the dark around 17:00 while we were returning to ranch in UTV with lights on in 40,000 acre tract. Object approached very close with extremely bright white lights and hovered for some time without any hearable noise. We were startled at first wondering what it was and then stopped to watch the object as it approached. Once we stopped, it hovered nearby in silence with extreme bright white light lighting up the sky and ground. Other individual looked at object with binoculars and described it as triangular with three bright lights. I had already packed my binoculars and phone for the trip back to ranch in UTV and was unable to look closely or take pictures. All occurred in just a few minutes and when I attempted to unpack phone camera the object rose and moved directly south of us at a high rate of speed without any noise.

Three dim orange circles, flying in the formation of a triangle, were observed overhead.  The three circles appeared to be 3 times the size of a star as they were flying lower than a plane or other aircraft would.  The three circles were also moving approximately 3 times faster than the speed of an aircraft and were only observed for 4-5 seconds before disappearing into the dark sky.  The middle circle moved independently of the others so I speculate that the three circles were three different objects.

I was about to walk in the front door of my house in Newnan, GA, at 6:30pm on November 19, 2011, when I just happened to look up at the sky and see five or six (I was so surprised that I didn’t think to count the exact number) glowing orange fireballs in the sky.   
 
They were moving from North to South in a long formation that was almost single file.  They were almost flickering like a fire seen from a distance, but they maintained a constant orange color throughout my observation.  
 
I watched them move silently at a moderate speed to the south.  As they passed behind my house, I thought that I saw one of them make some erratic movements, but it might have simply been a distortion effect as there were some thin tree branches in the way on that side of the house.  They made no sound throughout the event.  
 
An airliner passed to the west at about 15,000ft, maybe 20 miles away, and I would think that the crew probably would have seen it well if they had been looking in this direction, but during the busy time of an approach, they may not have noticed.  
 
My house lies right under the arrival corridor for aircraft coming in to ATL from the Southwest, which is a very busy arrival, so there may have been other aircraft in the vicinity that I didn’t notice.

I was located on the roof deck bar of the Salem hotel.  I arrived there approximately at 21:15 hrs with my wife and a friend.  Upon settling in at the bar and waiting for our first order of drinks of the night.  I noticed 5 lights off in the distance.  They were rounding a telecommunications tower off in the distance.  At first I thought it might have been aircraft lining up going towards Logan international airport, but after observing them for sometime the lights were just hanging there not moving, and after several mins they began to move.  I asked several people there that night if that was a normal occurrence.  The two bar tenders and waiting staff replied no, it was the first time they had ever seen something like that.  The lights began to move off in another direction and towards the ground were they were not visible anymore.  If this was a flight pattern for landing air craft there should have been more coming in intervals, but have after these lights were g! one there were no more lights that came.  From my vantage point I believe the lights were near Swampscott, Ma, and the Salem, Ma. 
 
Roughly seven mins after being there I took a picture of these lights, and then they began to move, but they were going very slow, not like an ordinary planes flight path that should have looked quicker even at the distance that I was at.  This stuck with me and I wanted to check and see if there were any other reports of these lights and I came across your website. 
 
I have seen many things, I am month away from my contract ending with the military and I am Staff Sergeant I’m the Army.  I am aware of the way aircraft work and act during observation Wether fixed wing or rotary.  I also should mention there were no visible indication lights, the normal red-green blinking lights, nor were there any landing lights. What I am describing can be viewed on any aircraft.

Red/orange on top and bottom w/green lights in the middle.  Steady, then moved, then shot up and away. 
 
There were several people (friends and family) outside at several stages of inhibriation remaining from the 4th of July fireworks that ended 1/2hr prior.  The sky was overcast with some bright stars and, I believe, the constellation Sagitarius visible directly above.  I'm not sure of exactly which one, whatever, but I then looked NW along the ridge line, we live along the Kanawha River Valley, and saw the UFO. 
 
It was a bright red and orange egg-shaped object, no more than 2-5mi away, in a stationary position and that is when I went for my iPhone 5s and started to record video after all were in agreement that it was what I was seeing.  In the video you will hear a female voice describe its movement, but it remained in a still position for a few minutes and then headed along the ridge line toward us.  As it came closer I was able to notice the lights in the middle and they were a greenish color, the lights were extremely bright so it was hard to be certain of the middle color, but from there it appeared as if the top and bottom were disjointed leaving me to believe that it was also ""wobbling"" as it was in motion. 
 
After the motion it once again stopped for a few moments and I got a straight on look at it once again. It was now in a steady position as if it were ""checkin us out,"" and from there it headed straight upwards.  Now to explain the ""vanishing"" is kind of hard to detail due to it being night and also being unaware of the specific cloud cover, but I can only give two theories as to what I saw from there.  Regardless of clouds the lights were so bright that it would have been hard for the clouds to hide so much of it so easily right away.   
 
What I saw is it looked like it dissipated as if it went through a ""worm-hole"" kind of like Einstein explained in his Theory of Relativity and the 4th plane or dimension.

The one highest up then shot off and, in order, they sequentially shot off and disappeared. We thought maybe they were planes, but they hovered in place perfectly for way too long to be a plane and were very bright (we initially thought they were stars). They also moved much too quickly to be any known man-powered craft. We also used a constellation app on the phone to try to determine if it was a constellation, but the app was unable to detect any major stars or planets where the anomaly appeared in the sky.

I would like to preface this report by giving a little bit of back ground.  I formerly was enlisted in the United States Navy and was attached to an Intruder squadron.  I have seen almost all types of military and civilian aircraft and am familiar with flight mechanics.  Also I was not under any influence of any drugs or alcohol.  I am normal and healthy with no history of mental illness. 
 
November, 7th 2010/6:50am  I was returning home from work traveling East on Hwy 14 near Eagle Lake, MN.  Upon clearing a crest in the hill I noticed a bright blinding light to the East about 300 to 400 feet in the air.  Having experience in the aviation field my first thought was that it had to be landing lights of an airplane since there was a local airport only a couple miles away.  The object was at the time was between 1 and 1.5 miles away. 
 
After traveling 30-40 seconds the light neither moved in altitude or distance.  It appeared to be stationary. I started approaching the object driving about 55 MPH.  As I got closer I was able to start to distinguish the shape of the object.  Initially it looked just like a ball of light.  As I could start to make out features it looked like a shiny metallic surface with intense light shining from the underside of the object.  At this point I was able to eliminate airplanes, jets, and helicopters as possible objects. 
 
Not being able to Identify it as any aircraft I know.  I attempted to turn to a second line of reasoning. The object looked similar to a giant Mylar foil balloon.  Based on the size of the tree's below the object it was about the size of a normal 3 bedroom home.  My thought at the time was perhaps they were trying out a new type of weather balloon or I also heard that the military was trying out new dirigibles to patrol the boarders between the United States and Canada.  Perhaps it could have been one of those.  As I approached, the object started moving west the same direction I was heading.  ((sic.  Witness was going east.  Please see below.  PD))  I was traveling at the posted rate of speed 55 yet the object was pulling away quickly.  Having no cars in front of me and knowing the road was straight I accelerated to about 85mph in an effort to get closer. *never will I condone breaking the law but something was obviously not right.  At this point the object swiftly pulled away veered North and shot across the sky at an extreme rate of speed.  After about 8 to 12 seconds it was out of my visual range. Total elapsed time from first sighting, until loss of visual was about 7 minutes. 
 
Since I was in my car driving at highway speeds I was unable to hear any type of engine noise.  There were no vapor trails.  To reference how fast this object was moving..  I have seen F-14's flying at full speed.  This object was moving at least twice that speed.  And I also know that any soft surface of a dirigible would not be able to hold up at those speeds therefore the surface had to be solid.  I cannot tell you what this was.  I can tell you what it was not.  I told my now ex-wife about it and she seemed quite skeptical..  The only other person I have told about this is my sister.  And It sounds crazy..  If I heard someone telling it I would think they sounded crazy..  But I cannot forget about it.  And the least I can do is report it. 
 
 
((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) 
 
I just noticed I switched my east and west up in the second to last paragraph.. I was heading east.  I was never heading west. I always took Hwy 14 west in to work, and Hwy 14 east from work.  I was returning home.  A misprint on my part spell check did not catch it.",44.1585,-93.8708,11,Fall

I’ve never seen that kind of pattern in the sky before and quickly pointed to them to the driver.  He began looking and noticed they were moving.  We pulled off of the main road and got out and watched the “stars”.  They were moving in a line but what was really cool was the fact that the “star” in the front of the line would quickly disappear and then another would appear at the end of the line.  The way they were moving was like a large ship with lights on the side and the ship was rotating.  This went on for about 3-4 minutes and then one by one, each moving light disappeared.

On the night of the 11th of August, four friends and myself went out to the country to watch the meteor shower.  Around 11:30 we noticed a blinking star. Brighter than all the others. We watched it for a bit then noticed different colors being displayed.  We recorded red, blue, orange, green and white. It would dim down then get extremely bright.  As it got brighter it would shoot down about two or three inches then proceed to do what I can only describe as loop-de-loops.  We watched this object for a good 4 hours before we left. We also noticed that there were moments when the object would become red, extremley bright, and then turn into three in the shape of a triangle.  The two extra lights would then be sucked into the one, then proceed to dim down again.  The object acts as if it were a star when any aircraft passed in its direction by dimming down, not blinking and being stationary. The five of us then left to drop of the other three observers that were pres! ent.  The driver and I then went to a friends house to tell him we had seen something strange but needed him to come with us to justify our experience.  We then took him out to where we were and told him to just look at the 'star'. He then asked myself and the driver if it was moving.  We asked what he saw and he described to us everything that we had observed earlier.  Might I note that no druga or alchohol were involved.

Looking over, I noticed lights in the sky, moving at the same speed and parallel with each other. 
 
Upon seeing them, it turned out there were two more sets of lights.  One of the sets of lights, reminded me of a colon symbol from the keyboard, moving straight over my house and over the trees.  Following the same path was another set of lights only the looked as if a colon was on it's side. 
 
The third set of lights, broke the formation by going diagonally across the sky.  It seemed to have started off with them but ended up breaking away, still staying parallel with itself.  It was almost as if the sets of lights were attached in the pairs by a bar. 
 
These lights didn't blink, and they weren't slow like a plane. They also seemed to be flying too low for them to be a plane as well. I'm pretty sure they were actually in the atmosphere. 
 
As I watched them, I had three thoughts cross my mind.  One was just surprise, but the other two thoughts stood out.  These thoughts were ""get inside"" and ""what are you looking for?"".  Of course, I had stayed rooted to the spot until they were out of site, before my friend and I said goodbye.

This sighting happened in broad daylight blue skies.  Two huge yellow gold objects were hovering side by side about 30 feet away from each other.  The sighting was already in progress when I arrived.  I watched these 2 huge star like objects for about 7 to 10 minutes until one of them ""turned off"" and the other continued to hover.

Want to report this sighting that occurred last night in December the 26th, 2019.  We (me and my 11 year old son) was walking to the Walgreens nearest to our home when suddenly out of nowhere I felt that of a strange headache along with a metallic state to my mouth.  It struck me extremely odd when my son said to me suddenly, moments after I began feeling the symptoms, that his mouth tasted as if he had a penny in his mouth! As my son said this he placed both his hands over his head, clearly a sign that he, as well, was feeling that of the same symptoms as me!  This was at night however , for that of a split second the  lighting of the sky appeared that of an orange/purplish light color ... resembling that of a sunrise!  We both exchanged a nonverbal look, a look that gave me a chill up my spine, as it had confirmed to me that indeed, my son as well had seen the same strange phenomenon. It is then that my son looked up & his eyes widened so large it frightened me!  My son pulled, rather tugged me inside the Walgreens and had stated to me that he had seen that of a wide large light greyish object that was not to far above from us... only a few feet up above the Walgreens.  At this point in time I did not see what he had just described, just te sky within a split of a second turning into that of a sunrise color.  I calmed him down while we was in the Walgreens photo section and reassured him that due to the sky turning a different color, perhaps as it subsided he thought he had seen what he just described.  When we got home, I went to the back last room of our house, which is one of my eldest son’s room. To my utter shock and disbelief, the metallic taste in my mouth along with the headache, which I had experienced along with my son and had left once we saw that ‘strange sunrise’ just a mere 20 to 30 minutes earlier by the Walgreens.  I was in quite a stage of shock!  Due to the notion that my son has 3 windows parallel to one another, I quickly gave a fast glimpse, expecting to see that ‘strange sunrise’ , if you will... except, this time,   i had witnessed was definitely out of this world!  A long, grey rectangle.. or should I say ship looking object slowly past the 2 front windows first ... in that of a slow motion, making a left to the 3rd window!  I quickly looked at my son’s closet mirror, which allows me to see 2 of the windows of his room to see if what i had just seen was there or what in the world was going on?!  Next thing I know I was awakened by my son asking me if my migraine (I am a chronic migraine sufferer) has subsided .... I quickly jumped up from the bed and just couldn’t believe what was happening!  It was as if one minute I was staring into the mirror and the next being awakened, mind you, tucked in, in my son’s bed!",40.72474261083744,-74.06297906403941,12,Winter

North Bothell, WA... Between 4:50-4:55 PM my wife and I were sitting on our front porch which faces East.  I know this to be the exact time because we called my sister and cell phone shows called made at 4:52. As we talked on speaker phone, my eye caught something moving north-to-south (from Mill Creek to Bothell) straight across the sky. It was hard to determine elevation and size but likely at a thousand feet or so and small, round shape (?). It was shiny and appeared reflective so hard to determine the exact shape. I saw it first and asked. ""what's that?"" My wife looks up and immediately says, ""a bird"". I continued looking to make sure it wasn't a sea gull or white bird flapping wings, and beyond a doubt it was not a bird. I said, no way that is a bird. That looks really strange. She could tell it wasn't a bird either and then replied, ""a mylar balloon"". Ok, now a balloon caught in a wind current is a possibility and fits som! e of the description. I am rational and reasonable and this could explain it. However, something just seemed off about that explanation.  I tried to get my brain to see it as a mylar balloon but the size, speed and way it moved could not reconcile. I would not waste my time reporting this if I was confident it was just a balloon or a drone. We continued to watch it as continued out of view... no other changes as it went out of sight.

On the night of January 1, 2011 I picked up my girlfriend from her place of work, off of S. Clinton St. across from the Doylestown train station.  The time was approximately 10:25pm EST.  We proceeded to drive south on Clinton street making our way towards Hart Ave.  While continuing down the hill I noticed numerous bright objects in the eastern sky.  It was immediately evident that this was at the least something uncommon or unusual.  We made a left turn at Hart ave. and pulled into a parking lot behind a bank.  At this point we both exited the vehicle and stood in the parking lot to get a better look.  The time at this point must have been about 10:27pm EST. 
 
 Initially we saw about twenty of these objects moving relatively slow from south to north across the eastern sky.  They were following a semi circular trajectory, appearing out of the dark in the southeastern sky, moving towards our position slightly while continuing north.  After covering much the length of the sky, they began gaining altitude and moving away from us before disappearing again into the darkness.  They continued in a constant stream like this for about ten minutes, with new ones appearing in the south east as they disappeared to the northeast.  For the most part, at any point in time there was somewhere between 15-20 of these in the sky at once.  They all followed the same general trajectory but individualy they carried there own paths(almost as though they were travelling in formation and connected by a string).  As they made their way across the sky, most of them maintained their relative positions to each other.  However some of them were bobbing around.  ! They all seemed to maintain a constant speed the entire time.  At 10:36 a placed a phone call to mother for her to meet me in town and bring a camera.  At about this time the lights started to appear in fewer numbers.  Eventually dwindling to about 2 or 3.  Finally the last one went across at about 10:40.  Of interested note, shortly before the last one went across the sky my girlfriend and I heard the sound of a jet, but did not visualize any planes. 
 
At no point in time did the objects make any type of noise, additionally, they moved unlike any aerial manned objects I have ever seen. 
 
 The objects themselves looked like balls of fire.  Some were slightly larger and brighter than others.  They ranged in color from a deep red to bright yellowish-orange.  However all had an appearance similar to that of a campfire at a distance.  They almost looked like bioluminescent deep sea creatures moving in the pitch dark of the ocean. 
 
 It is difficult for me to judge the altitude of these objects, I can say they appeared to be flying much lower than a typical commercial liner. 
 
Initially when we first exited the vehicle, I freaked out on my girlfriend because she didn't know how to use her crummy camera phone(blackberry), however we did get it working and managed to snap a couple pictures.  The pictures by no means do justice to what we saw, and the actual objects appeared much brigher, larger, and in greater numbers. 
 
 I have read stories and seen videos of the chinese lanterns, and though they look similar, I stuggle to understand how they would appear/disappear, change color/size, and follow a semi cirular trajectory.  I am also unaware of any local group that releases such lanterns. 
 
 Additionally, there was some light fog with an overcast sky.  It was difficult for me to tell how low the cloud cover was.  About 30 minutes after arriving back home it began to rain.

On November 7th, my boyfriend and I were driving down FM 518 towards Friendswood, TX, from League City, TX, around 6:15pm.  My boyfriend was driving our truck and I was sitting in the passenger seat looking out the window.  As we crossed a bridge over Chigger Creek in Friendswood, on FM 518, I saw two glowing orange/red dots outside my window that looked to be hovering in the direction of League City and/or Dickinson, TX.  The dots were sitting at a low enough altitude that we could  not see the orange/red dots in the sky from street level in Friendswood - due to the trees.  We tried driving elsewhere to a clearing in which we could spot them again, originally I had seen them when we crossed a bridge, which provided us visibility from the surrounding tree line - but, we were unable to locate the orange/red dots again after the initial sighting.  The dots did not really depict a shape from where I saw them, it more so looked like a straight line. 
 
When I described what I saw to my boyfriend, while we were crossing the bridge, he immediately said, ""it sounds like what was recorded in Dickinson the other night.""  He pulled up the Talk of Dickinson Facebook page and showed me a video that was shared on the page.  Sure enough, the same exact lights had been spotted and recorded two days prior - on November 5th.  The video depicts 3 orange/red dots that are in the sky.  Only two lights are visible on each side... if there is a shape.  If you watch the video, it looks like there are only two orange/red dots in the sky, however as the driver continues driving you will see the third dot (maybe as he got closer to the object/dots?).  The dots appear to make a triangular shape... possibly a square shape in the sky.  As the video continues, the dots dissipate or the tree line cuts off the dots... to me it seemed like the dots were dissipating. 
 
I wanted to share, because it reminded me of the orange/red lights recorded over Las Vegas a while ago.  They also did not seem to be flares since there were multiple dots in which seemed to be sitting relatively symmetrically from one another in the sky.  They were hovering - however, the sighting time/duration is unknown as I saw them while we were driving and they may have moved out of my visibility due to where we were.  The duration of the actual event may have been longer if you were closer to the lights.  Additionally, the duration of the lights may have been longer than the shared video recorded.",29.4578,-95.0342,11,Fall

After just turning eastbound on Idaho 74 from Mt. Olympus Way, I witnessed an awesome display of fourteen or fifteen diamond shaped lights.  The lights were amber in color and were slowly rising into the night sky, climbing out over the fields, heading towards the southeast. 
 
Lights were grouped into a loose formation, several in front, a large group in the middle, followed by several in the rear.  I watched the formation from the driver’s seat of the truck. They couldn’t have been more than 3,000 feet in front of me, and 300 feet or less in altitude and climbing. 
 
I’d say they were all about the same size, fifteen or so feet in the middle and a little higher length-wise.  Many of them were a translucent amber color in the midsection, tapering to a hazy brighter white color at the edges. 
 
In all my years driving 74, hauling scrap from the shop, I’ve never seen anything like them.  Watching them drift away, it was as if I had startled them.  All of a sudden, they were just there, like they had just risen from the ground.

We were at the U2 concert at Soldier Field.  It started to sprinkle a few drops so I looked up to see what the clouds looked like.  When I looked up I saw three white strobing lights heading East to West.  They were in a perfect triangle with what would appear to be the flat side facing forward in the direction of flight.  I am assuming that the three lights were on an object, I could not make out any structure between the lights. 
 
The object was passing in and out of the bottom of the clouds, although it never became fully obscured.  The MDW TAF says that there is a broken cloud layer at 5000 and a scattered layer at 12000, although the sighting was two hours previous to me checking the TAF. 
 
What I thought was odd was that the craft didn't have any beacons or navigation lights.  All I could see was the three simultaneously strobing white lights. There were other aircraft in the sky, there were two helicopters circling almost constantly.

Driving home, I turned into my drive way (150 ft) to my rural home.  Half way down the drive way, I noticed a bright yellow light in the sky which quickly turned into two lights. Then to the right of the lights another one appeared, then two or three more on the right side.  The lights were almost in a hooking pattern like they were around a disc-shaped aircraft.  Quickly, almost the exact same thing happened to the right of the first set of lights.  One light turned into two then quickly into five or six. It was way too big to be a plane.  The lights were not as high up in the sky as a plane would be. The lights were also too far apart to be anything like a plane.  It was like they were lights on a disc-shaped aircraft.  I immediately picked up my phone and tried to call someone else who lives in my house (this is how I know it was at 10:43pm), then panicked and drove my car as fast as I could down my drive-way and into my garage, jumped out of my car without even! turning my lights off and ran inside to wake someone up. I was terrified.  I was so scared that I couldn't speak for two or three minutes. I ran back outside to look back up into the sky and they were gone.  I was shaking bad for about thirty minutes. I continued to shake the rest of the night and had goose bumps for hours afterward.  I have never believed in this sort of thing and it really shook me up.  I have never been anything even close to as scared as I was for that night.  I was shaking the rest of the night and ended up sleeping with my lights on, afraid to go back outside. 
 
I know there is no way this could have been any sort of star (they was too close and were bright yellow), aircraft (they were too close and appeared out of nowhere), or any thing else that I've ever seen in the sky.  It was too far up to be any kind of animal and too close and big to be any type of aircraft I have ever seen.",40.5594,-90.0237,05,Spring

On January 5th, 2019, at 8:30 pm my 15 year old son and I were staying overnight at our hunting club in Taylor County, Ga.  The area is very rural and at least 10 to 12 miles from the nearest towns located between Talbotton, Ga, and Butler, Ga.  There was no light pollution whatsoever and a clear night. 
 
Our tent had gotten wet inside due to a lot of rain the past few weeks, so we ended up sleeping in our truck parked in a small field at our hunting club.  While sitting in the truck wasting time surfing the internet on our cell phones my son noticed a bright object far up in the sky and asked me what it was.  At first I thought it was a planet or star just brighter and standing out from the other stars.  The object then began moving from side to side, up and down, circular motions and straight lines.  At this time, we both became excited and curious as to what this thing was. 
 
We began filming the object with our cell phones the best we could.  As the object moved around it appeared to change shape from a ball of white light to a bluish color, then yellowish and red colors. + At times the outer edges of the circular object would look fuzzy and flash from dim to bright and change shapes as it moved. 
 
We continued to watch this thing for at least 30 minutes while we talked back and forth about what it could be and if anyone would believe us even though we have video of it on our cell phones. 
 
The object simply disappeared in less than a blink of an eye as 3 to 4 Airplanes were approaching in its direction.  Needless to say it took us a long time to fall asleep that night and overslept the next morning till 11:00 a.m. when we were supposed to be in our deer stands by daybreak.  I've never seen anything like it in my life and I've been in Law Enforcement for 34 years .",32.6824,-84.5496,01,Winter

I was staring out my window at some lights from a ranch and then I got my binoculars to make sure they were nothing more.   As I’m staring at them I noticed to my left was an object flashing red, blue and white.   
 
My first initial thought was an airplane because it was moving from left to right just like one.  I go back to staring at the lights at the ranch looking for any awkward movements.  
 
I set my binoculars down to look for the airplane and to my surprise it was in the same spot that I had seen it last, so now I look at it more careful and I noticed that it was flashing more like strobe light and not like an airplane, and that’s when realized this is not airplane.   
 
I then looked at it with the binoculars and noticed it would get smaller and then bigger, I also saw it moving up and down left and right but not in that sequence.  
 
So then I decide to tell my girlfriend I’m looking at a UFO, she didn’t believe me and demand that I went back to bed.  I didn’t know wha! t else to do so I called 911, after that my girlfriend is now interested knowing more about this object.
