11-16-2017, 8:45pm driving north on highway 101  from Florence, Oregon, to Yachats, I saw a large white disc off to the left of the car, out over the ocean.  I was on the passenger side and could look at it for about 5-10 seconds.  We were driving north along the edge of the cliffs - about 200 feet up from the water.  The perfectly circular disc was evenly lighted, - not harsh or brilliant like a lighthouse light but evenly soft white.  No glow to it.  It was approx. the size of a half dollar at my finger tips when my arm is extended.   
 
It did not move and hovered just about 20° below my shoulder height when seated in the car - a mid sized Escape.... not the newer taller one - out over the water.  We did not hear any noise.  Trees got in our view so about 1 minute or less later we pulled into the parking lot of the Sea Lions Cave where I got out and could see most of the coast to Florence.  All was dark and quiet - no sign of anything anywhere in the water or along the coast.

Carlotta, CA February 6, 2018 18:29 to 18:30 PM Pacific standard time. 
 
Looking south about 30 degrees above the horizon I observed a glowing object.  With binoculars I was able to make out two short gas jets.  It moved southeast and as it approached the horizon the two gas jets became much longer.  I think it could be a booster rocket reentering the atmosphere.  It started out bright and small and became much longer with twin tails and more diffuse.  At its longest it was about 1/2 degree long (about the width of the moon).  It got to about magnitude -2 or -3 quite a much brighter than Sirius.

I was making a food delivery to a house.  As I was coming up the street (heading north) an orange orb in the sky.  Simply, it looked like a fire ball that faded in an out, but moved at a very slow speed (appeared to be decending...and headed in a south westerly direction).  I made the delivery to the customer, and told them to come and see what I was seeing in the sky.   Another orange orb appeared, then another, and yet another. I returned to work, and was telling my co-workers about it.  A fellow co-worker and I were standing outside, when yet another appeared, and we both saw that orange orb together. 
 
This was not the first time, for me, with seeing orange orbs.  I saw them on New Years Eve (January 2013--right after mid-night) as well, with a group of about 9 friends.  We saw a total of 4 that evening.  The orange orbs during the New Years Eve sighting, were moving north easterly, and appeared to be ascending.

My mom passed the day before, I was heartbroken. I had taken care of her for six years. I decided I would go outside that that night and take a picture of the night sky with my infrared camera. What I saw next was a huge blue eye looking back at me. I had many sightings of some explained and some unexplained things since moving to Oregon in 1993. So at this point nothing surprised me anymore and I was numb anyway grieving the loss of my beautiful mom. I had more blue eyes show up later in my pictures, and even one after I moved to AZ. I was told this could be a portal? 
 
I understand too, if you don’t post this, because it’s not a typical UFO type. Just very strange. I just came back across it in my photos. I thought, I would share it anyway.

My husband and I were outside last night in the hot tub around ten pm, pst, and saw what looked like a bright star low in the sky east of Ukiah. As we watched it we noticed it was actually moving, sort of hovering, very slowly. We observed it for up to two hours slowly making its way west. I mean it was inching forward. Every now and then a tiny red light flashed behind it. If I didn't know any better I'd say it was a helicopter - we live under the flight path to our small, rural airport, but it moved so slowly and steadily that it didn't like a helicopter and we certainly didn't hear any helicopter sound. It was silent. After a few hours we went to sleep - it was till there. Would love to know what it was. We typically go for a quick soak every night and get used to seeing satellites and what not. This was different...it was too close to be a plane or satellite.

It was at midnight on New Year’s Day when I noticed the unidentified flying objects hovering the cloudless northern skies.  At first I began to think that the unknown objects were part of a firework display exhibited by the local residents.  Then upon focusing into the night sky, I quickly realized this was no firework display at all. 
 
The object began to fade in the sky about 45 degrees from the horizon from a tiny spectacle to a round, dark orange/amber glowing shape which magnified about three times its original size.  Once this object achieved its optimal size, it then flew south for approximately 15 seconds at an incredible speed and then decelerated.  The next segment is what caught my attention the most.  Once the object stopped from its propulsion like movement, it stood stationary glowing brighter and brighter in the sky with a strong hue of orange dominating its presence.   After standing still for about a minute, it then (in my best description) shed some droplets of light descending directly beneath from the original object at a distance not measurable with the naked eye.  This image reminded me of heating a metal to its melting point and then observing its free falling behavior as it was poured out of a ladle.  The object would then fade away into the darkened universe as if it traveled out of! our galaxy and onto the next.   This particular occasion occurred several times over the next 35 minutes and at one moment in time, there were as much as three “UFOs” in the sky simultaneously.",48.0872,-123.1146

On Sat. Aug. 30th, 2014, at about 10 p.m. I saw strange lights over the sky of Veneta, Oregon, and Eugene, Oregon.  What I saw looked like a giant snowflake (for lack of better way of describing it) and it had pulsing lights all over the front of it!  The pulsing lights were in vertical sections, with one section coming on really bright and then fading, while the section next to it came on very bright.  The sections alternated like that all across the front of it. 
 
This thing was traveling through the sky at a slow speed and I think it was near the Eugene airport.   
 
After I watch it for about 30 seconds, it suddenly divided and became two rounds things of pulsing lights.  They kept traveling through the sky at a slow speed, keeping a uniform distance between them.  After about another 30 seconds, they went behind some trees and I lost sight of them.   
 
Two vehicles were pulled off the road in strange places and no doubt the drivers had seen this also.   
 
I did not have a camera with me and that taught me to always have one with me in the future, as I never know what I may see!

It was New Year's Eve in NE Portland near NE Sandy, it had just turned midnight and we went outside to let our kiddo bang pans and ring in the new year.  My kid hurt his hand and yelled out, I turned to see if he was okay and was now facing north toward I-84, I looked at his hand and then he ran back into the house, with his father following him.   
 
I did not follow because as I looked up, I saw some reddish orange orbs in the sky, maybe 50 feet up (just above the one story roof lines of our complex).  They appeared to be floating straight towards me, flickering like candles but synchronized.  I called my husband to come back out.   
 
At first, I was afraid they were some huge embers from NYE fireworks or something and was watching to see if they would burn out or land on our building.   
 
Before they reached our building, they took a  turn to the left (about 12 feet or so from me) though the turn was a right angle, the orbs floated smoothly, not particularly fast, just g! liding and flickering, more kept coming, spaced evenly apart and in some kind of formation, at the same height, spacing and rate.  They were almost floating lantern like but not that and way to small for that.  There were around 8 or so in all.  
 
We walked closer and watched them floating by and flickering, not sure what the heck they were, they moved out of our sight and we went back inside.   
 
It kept nagging at me, so I began to look to see if embers like these were even possible from fireworks (I could find nothing.)  I looked for fires or other reports of these orbs in the local news and saw none but then I stumbled upon a bunch of information online about others reporting floating orange orbs in the sky, all over the world.

I quickly remembered there were no visible stars as my wife and I had discussed earlier in the evening when we were wondering what our chances of seeing the Supermoon were going to be (which were zero in our neighborhood of Portland; it was simply too cloudy). 
 
So, I do a double-take, get up from the couch and walk to the window to look out to the northwest at these four orange-ish red lights seemingly hovering in the sky.  I say to my wife, “Are those...what are those? Come here!” By the time she gets to the window one of them has moved higher and disappeared, so there are only three lights left. They hovered in the sky, eventually moved up over the next 90 seconds or so and then disappeared. 
 
These were not planes or stars. Shortly after the lights disappeared a plane was flying rather close to the horizon heading east, and it was clearly a plane with flashing lights.  The previous four lights were not blinking or flashing and moved up out of sight, not to the left or right.

I started running to take refuge in my garage, but before going in, I looked back to see what it might be.  Seeing nothing, but still hearing the now unbearable sound, I looked to the sky and saw two red rings, very high in the sky traveling at a very high rate of speed. 
 
	As quick as the noise appeared it disappeared, along with the red rings.  I ran into my home and called 911 and explained to the operator what I had just witnessed.  She told me a Sheriff’s Deputy would contact me.  The Deputy indeed did make contact and a report was filed.

LOCATION: Tacoma,Wa  COLOR: same as a star SIZE:  MOTION: (Blinking)left,right,up,up,left,down.all directions DIRECTION:according to the compass it was 115°SE when i lost sight of it the compass read 321°NW   For the last few months Ive been more into watching & trying to study the patterns of the stars.  Since oct 19th or so during haileys comets dust trails..(shooting stars).  I happened to be able (along with many others i'm sure) to witness that event.  So since then i've been tuned in more to whats above us...so I started bringing out the ole telescope, pad, pen & digital video camera.... 
 
The setting of which my ""claim"" took place is a balcony on the top (3rd) floor...On any clear night you'll see the moon & stars with no problem.... 
 
I've also taken in the consideration of that this location is near a amry/airforce base which has plenty of air traffic along with the normal planes you see as well.., also took in consideration of the fact that the Leonid meteor shower is roughly from nov 13-21 peaking around the 19th/20th I reckon. 
 
What happened was, I was out on the balcony with my camera & notepad same as almost every night checking out the stars as usual ..Then I see what appears to be a star but it dissapears a second later it flashed again but in a different spot this went on for almost a minute then I grabbed my HDcamcorder... 
 
Which took a few seconds to focus on the sky but, I see no ""blink"" Bout 17 seconds into the video I look down at the porch (balcony floor) to make sure the camera was working ok. As I aim back towards the sky It flashes again  multiple times..I lost sight with the camera bout 23 seconds later...it finally blinked, then it was higher blinked again even higher ..as I back against the railing around the balcony watching this ""ufo"" I see it's very high now .(normally in this area the military planes are very low)  It continued this same pattern across the sky..then vanished......The pattern of this ""ufo""..which appeared to be in guise of a star..moved in directions unlike any thing i have ever seen when i re-watch the footage it sends chills....in a good but eerie way....I waited exactly a month to report this...(except to some people I know)  Its a sad day dec_14th due to the conn. school shooting ..was weird to me is its a month later from this 'thing "" I saw...... 
 
So hopefully I'm able to send the footage your way or who evers...& hopefully it gets analyzed..so I know something...Because I truly believe it was other worldly..either way ..I just want the piece of mind.…",47.22041125,-122.4592503

I have only seen one other thing in my life that would qualify as a UFO and that was over Death Valley years ago.   In the daytime and a very physical looking object it was. 
 
The below described phenomena was quite different. 
 
I am a professional photographer (sorry did not have a camera on me - I was outside smoking my first cigarette of the new day) and was raised as an Air Force brat and have always watched movements in the sky just out of curiosity.  I guess it comes from always wanting to know what kind of plane was flying over head.  Hey, I was a cold war baby. 
 
OK so now to what I saw this morning. 
 
Looking up into still very dark morning sky, many stars still quite bright and visible, and just at the head of a vaporous string of light clouds moving to east, I noticed two perfect illuminated semi circles creating a broken full circle of light moving together as if facing each other.  They were traveling South West directly overhead, over Gresham, at a very consistent rate of speed. 
 
That broken but perfectly shaped semi-circle expanded slowly until it reached a consistent point, that if it was, let’s say at 70,000 ft, would be three or four hundred yards across.  Off to side there was a flash of bright but contained light.  Almost as if a large star just appeared and then disappeared. 
 
The broken semi circle of illuminated light kept moving in it’s original direction.  The bright flash of light happened again but this time in front of the moving broken semi circle.  The light again seemed to disappear.  But then reappeared almost immediately at the head of the the forward part of the semi circle.  At this point in the dark morning sky there were no illuminated vaporous clouds that were visible in the slightly to the north sky when I first noticed this phenomena. 
 
The trailing part of the semi circle band of vaporous light just disappeared and the forward semi circle now reshaped itself into a strange funnel shape as if illuminating directly out of the bright star like light, but off to it’s side - in a different orientation then it’s preceding travel shape. 
 
Both the bright star-like light and the funnel vaporous light traveled together in the same South West direction and then both instantly disappeared for no apparent reason. 
 
I would like to back up and rephrase that when the leading semi circle changed it’s shape and orientation, it’s shape defied what one would think of as either a light illuminating out into the atmosphere or a plane’s light or illuminated rocket exhaust. 
 
Imagine a star moving that had a headlight shining off to side at an angle but the light pattern was semi thick for several hundred feet as it moved away from bright light and then mushroomed out in a strange pattern and at the end point of it’s beam and made a perfect concave semi-circle.  Almost as if it was a strange, physics defying light that was illuminating an invisible perfect circle, while moving.  Again, the concave pattern at the end of this vaporous light range stopping as if it was illuminating an invisible large circle off to the back and side of this bright star-like light. 
 
I have never seen anything like it in all my years.",45.49789167,-122.4161317

I then realized this wasn't a satellite.  It seemed to be lower in the sky then a satellite, as it was a lot brighter.  It had six lights making a curved shaped and glided silently through the sky from the North West, heading South East.   
 
I watched the object for 5-7 seconds (felt like forever) before the six lights that made up the curve changed into one object and disappeared.

We had binoculars, warm jackets, Apple Cider (non alcoholic) and fresh baked apple and pumpkin pie. While we were watching the moon rise in a southeasterly direction, we were looking at some developing vapor trails from high altitude jets flying the routes up and down the heavily traveled west coast.  While doing this we noticed a string of lights (no vapor trail) that seemed to be at a fairly low altitude and headed from north to south over the mountain range we were on.  These lights were not very bright and seemed like they were attached to a structure of some sort that was very long and narrow but not linear, the lights seemed to be adjacent to each other or within a cubist framework.

I thought it remarkable as so many lights where in a precise straight line, and moving very fast, that I continued to watch as it flew directly over head. 
 
 The lights appeared to be broken up into separate distinct lights, like you would expect from an airplane window with solid spaces between the lights, but in an irregular pattern. I see airplanes and jets all day and nights around here (I'm near an airport), but it looked nothing like any plane I have ever seen. As it was directly over head I specifically listened for any sound and heard nothing. I looked to see if there was a body to the object,then noticed the line of lights was preceded and followed by a couple of ligths in the same straight line formation as the others, but separated by a lenghtly distance.  The overall length was huge, way to big for any commercial jetliner, and flying to low to not be making a very loud noise; I estimate it's altitude was about 2,500 ft. high. I watched as it flew in a straight line eastward until it flew out of sight. Very bizzare.

Bright white aura in the center looked like electricity. 
 
I was riding my bike down the street heading north one evening.  The sun was setting and the sky was clear but, dark.  I was looking at a bright star when all of a sudden I  noticed a floating object.  At first it looked like a balloon the size of dime as it got closer the object looked oval like the body of a bird without wings.  When the object  floated over me it was the size of a silver dollar or larger that's when I realized it was a UFO.  There were two blue dots about an inch apart from each other forming a circle.  The blue light forming the circle would rotate in all directions.  It was so beautiful.  When the object would face me full circle the white light in the center would get brighter like electricity. I've never experienced anything like this ever before. It was breathtaking.  I couldn't get my eye's away from it.  This sighting has been an awakening moment for me.  I now know that we are being watched.

There were no lights on it whatsoever, and it flew silently - absolutely NO sound.  My mind struggled to figure out what I was seeing.  I was barely able to make out the triangular shape of it, and I wondered at first if it was a formation of geese. This craft flew SO smoothly and swiftly, gliding through the night air.  It was right overhead and couldn't have been anymore than 50 ft. above the large fruitless mulberry trees nearby. I'm not good with measuring the sizes of things in my head, but this craft had to have been somewhere between 50 and 100 ft. across.

I was looking up into the sky noticing how clear it was.  I was looking out towards the west, which would be toward the Seattle airport from where I live.  Because of this I am often aware of aircraft in the distance.  Normally I watch very carefully for any sign that would let me know that it is an airplane, flashing lights, in line for landing, etc.  I noticed that either the planet Venus or Jupiter was noticeable and very bright.  Looking down and to the left of the bright planet, there was another very bright light, which I initially took as a star.  Confused by this because it was so bright and I was unfamiliar with any other planet being that close to another one at this time, I looked at it for a few minutes.  In that time of watching it, it began to move slowly up from a three o’clock position up to what I would call the 12 o’clock position.  It moved very slow and precise across the sky.  I continued watching it because I was thinking that it had to! be an airplane.  Because it never flashed any red lights or changed from its original bright state, I started thinking it had to be a UFO.   As it stayed at the 12 o’clock position above my head for a few second it was if someone turned off a light switch and I know longer saw any light from it again.

At 10:46 PM, my husband and I were driving home from watching fireworks.  We live in a quiet area, fairly well wooded, in a suburban/rural setting, 15 miles east of Seattle.  We live in an area called Union Hill which is 500 feet above sea level and is a hill top above the small city of Redmond, Washington.   
 
We were almost home, a neighborhood with most homes on one acre plots. I was watching out the passenger side window of the car when I saw a large firework explode.  Beside it I saw an immensely, intense glowing orange light, spherical shape, almost like a fireball.  I told my husband to immediately stop the car and back-up.  He did and I jumped out of the car and clearly saw a bright, bright, bright orange ball.  They were off toward the eastern sky, not too far off as they appeared in the same proximity of where I had just seen the firework explode.  (They were not directly overhead.)  Followed close behind was a second orange sphere, identical to the first, and! following the driving line of the first ball.  Then, trailing just slightly further behind, was a third sphere.  All identical in color. The most unbelievable, intense glowing orange I have ever seen.   
 
My husband was on the driver side and keep telling me to take  picture.  I wanted to but just felt that if I moved my eyes the objects would be gone before I could figure out how to get a photo.  I watched for maybe 30 seconds.  All three looked like they were glowing hot.  Once they passed us I could still see them flying but they no longer glowed.  I could see almost like an outline of the ball, faintly defined.  It was as if the glowing part was in the front of the object but the backs were dark.  And then they were gone.

I kept looking at it and noticed it appeared to be not one light, but multiple lights, at least 3 lights and perhaps 4.  All together they were in the shape of a perfect triangle, with the point toward us consisting of perhaps 2 lights close together.  The lights were colored yellowish.  The UFO was approximately due west from us, elevated approx. 40 degrees up from the horizon.  My best guess is that its altitude was perhaps 3500-5000 feet above ground, and maybe 4 miles from our position. 
 
""It"" seemed to appear to be moving very very slowly to the east, almost as if in a slow moving hover.  No sound could be discerned from it. We could see only lights. My wife took some pics with her cell phone but they just show a faint blur (pixelated) area.   
 
After about 5 minutes of looking, we went back to our apartment to get my monocular, binoculars, camera, and to make a quick report on Facebook, in the hopes that others saw it too.  That took about 3-4 minutes, then we went back outside to the place we had observed the UFO.  We could not locate the UFO again and noted that the sky appeared to be hazy now and clouding up some.

I was walking Southbound on the Iron Horse Trail in San Ramon, CA around 5pm on January 25, 2011, when I noticed three low-flying bright white objects traveling from East to West across the sky. 
 
It appeared as if they were traveling West from the general direction of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.  The objects moved at a slow-to-fast pace, often at a drift much slower than airplane/helicopter traffic that is regularly seen in this area.  The shape of the light was elliptical in nature, but it was so bright that it was difficult to see the object edges.  For that reason, it is difficult to make a solid judgement regarding the final shape of the object.  I will say that they appeared to be more oblong/disc-shaped, but at some points they appeared more circular and symmetrical as they moved across the sky. 
 
The sun had already dropped from view, so the objects really stood out across the colored sky.  I stood and watched for 15 minutes as they headed across a flight path that appeared to parallel the path of the 580 freeway going from East to West towards the Oakland/San Francisco area. 
 
There were three objects total. Regarding the flight path and group formation of the objects, I am going to describe this in terms of a grid, from my standpoint on the trail at the time of the sighting.  I work in the technology field, so I'm going to describe it as if I was looking at grid on a horizontal/vertical x/y axis. 
 
Think of this as if you were looking at the latitude and longitude lines on a map.  That should help with envisioning the explanation, as this is a difficult thing for me to describe otherwise. 
 
With that in mind, it appeared that each of the objects was flying on a fixed path, parallel with the ground.  Each of the three objects was at a different elevation, but it appeared that each of them stayed on a solid path that appeared to run parallel with the natural curve of the Earth's surface.  To the naked eye, and given the short distance in which the objects traveled and eventually disappeared in, it appeared as if the objects didn't adjust vertical elevation at all at any point during the sighting. 
 
While they each stayed on a consistent and steady horizontal flight path, the group formation and speed of the objects appeared more inconsistent. At first, all three objects flew in a tight equilateral triangular formation.  As the objects moved across the sky, they would independently change speed, eventually flying in a formation that more represented an isosceles triangle, then a scalene triangle, and then eventually back to an isosceles triangle formation.  Each object appeared to be at a different elevation, with the elevation differences between each object appearing to be equal to the naked eye.  The speed varied during the sighting, with each accelerating and decelerating independently at speeds slower than typical air traffic. 
 
There are 3 major airports (SFO, OAK and San Jose Airport) and many smaller airports (Livermore, Buchanan, Napa) and Travis AFB within a 65 mile radius of the sighting, so we regularly see all forms of air traffic.  These objects flew at varying rates of slow speed that aren't typical of any of the regular air traffic.  In addition, these objects had no FAA colored lights that are typically seen on regular air traffic. 
 
The reason I decided to post this nearly six months after the original date of the sighting was that I had stumbled across similar sightings online, and I decided that it would be helpful to document the sighting since it was so similar to others I had seen in California.  I also was able to capture an image on my cell phone of 2 of the 3 objects.  Unfortunately, the 3rd object was hidden behind a large power line pole, so it's not visible in the photograph. 
 
My background is in technology and design, and in my career I've also done a lot of work in photography and video.  What stood out to me here was the brightness of the objects, and how I was unable to distinguish the hard lines that would typically be seen around an object.  At sunset/dusk, any object in the sky is going to be backlit by the sun descending down the horizon line.  This means that the edges of that backlit object should be clearly visible.  The brightness of the objects, combined with the fact that there weren't visible edges, leads me to believe that these objects were radiating a large amount of light on their own. 
 
At the end of my roughly 15 minute observation, the objects disappeared from the sky.  It was as sudden as someone flipping a light switch.  There was no fading, or change in color or brightness of the objects. 
 
These could be government aircraft from a project at the Lawrence Livermore Labs, but they might not be either.  I guess that's why I posted the sighting here, because over the last six months there hasn't been a day that has gone by where I haven't looked up at the sky on a clear day in hope of seeing this again.  
 
I am a skeptic at heart, but I know what I saw that day was unlike anything I'd seen before.",37.75897857,-121.9318274

What I saw was 3 Blinking Lights and another one to the right below them.  It was coming from the West heading East.  At first all 4 were there then the bottom 4th light disappeared.  The other 3 went into (A) triangle formation.  Then the bottom light went out then the right bottom light went out.  So only the front light was there.  Out of no where a little light appeared from the right of the last light that was left. It past in front of the last light and moved from right to left. Then they all just disappeared. The color of the lights were orange and red. They were blinking and able to become translucent.

A flash of light lit my whole house.  My dog freaked out.  At the same time a friend who lives 15 miles away witnessed this same light and his dog freaked out aswell.   
 
I was wondering if anyone else noticed this.  I have never seen a UFO and don't nessasarly beleive in them, but I can not think of another explaination.

I was waiting at the traffic light in town when I looked over to my right, above mailbox peak. What I saw was a very small, ""U"" shaped cloud-like object. It had sharp points at the top, and was thicker at the bottom, almost what you would expect a dramatic meteor to look like. It was moving so slowly that I at first thought it was a stationary cloudlet. As I continued to look, I noticed it steadily closing the gap between itself and the horizon, and it disappeared over the mountain.. Never seen anything like that before, but I would love an explanation.

On Thursday morning, 25 July 2013, at approximately 00:26 PDT, I witnessed a fireball travelling west and slightly south from my location on the east side of The Dalles, Oregon. 
 
It began in the east-south-east, to the east of the moon, near the lowest star in Pegasus and streaked mainly to the west, disappearing just west of due south.  It went under the moon about three quarters of the distance above the horizon as compared to the moon.  I could not tell if it was heading due west and just losing altitude, or if it was actually moving somewhat to the south. 
 
The streak itself appeared to have a yellow/gold center with trailing ""sparks"", but the outsides or borders of the streak above and below had a green tint to them.  The streak terminated without any discernable report, either visual or aural.  It just disappeared at a point estimated at an elevation about one half the distance from the horizon to the moon, but well west of the moon, between Sagittarius and Aquila.

MILITARY KNOWS. LOOK. 
 
Hello. On 8/14/11 is the first time i saw these circular UFO's.  The first time it was a bright circular light flying at a lower altitude.  At first i thought it was an airplane but then i saw it pass over and there was still a solid light flying away.  What airplane has lights around the whole airplane? none.  And the object was completely quiete, no sound what so ever.  But it Didn't stop there.  The next day there were what looked to be military aircraft about 5-8 of them circling around the area of were I saw the object for hours.  I'd say they had a 5 mile radius if not more of just circling looking for this thing.  Then I saw the object again.  Sure enough 2 of the military aircraft's started following it flying above it then after about 2 minutes it diapered.  Then the day after they are back again. I looked out my window and saw at least 9 maybe 10 aircraft's flying in the air.  I believe there was only one UFO and the others were military because one of the ligh! ts was much brighter then the others.  The were dog fighting flying through the air for AT LEAST 1 and a half if not 2 hours.  I would see them circling the object then regrouping in formation and fly towards it again.  But after 30 minutes i stopped watching so I didn't see if the military shot it out of the sky or not. All the object I saw were circular BRIGHT lights.  Not satilights I know what those look like. Please look into this. Lots of wierd objects flying around here.

Approximate date of sighting 10/29 or 10/30, approximate time 9-10 pm. 
 
I was outside in my backyard briefly letting the dog out, and looked up at the night sky, as I frequently do on a clear night.  Within my peripheral vision, I caught a rather bright flash (approximate astronomical magnitude -5) of white light of less than 1 second duration.  I would estimate the size of the light to be slightly larger than the planet Venus, and was noted at the straight overhead position, 90 degrees above the horizon.  This white blinking light reoccured several times, at an interval of ~10-15 seconds, and for a total duration of less than 1 minute.  It then abruptly stopped.  The blinking light remained in the exact same position throughout that time.  My impression is that it had an altitude of at least 20,000 feet, but possibly greater.  No associated object/fuselage could be observed.  I would say that it had a very similar appearance to a bright, blinking white beacon light that one would observe atop a radio transmitter tower.  It was definitely not an aircraft navigational light. 
 
I am an experienced observer of the night sky.  I am familiar with the commercial aircraft on their approach pattern to SFO (that path is due south of my location), and all the visible planets and 1st magnitude stars.  This was also not the ISS, a satellite, meteor, nor an iridium flare.",37.65732344,-120.9871591

Me and my fiance went out to have a smoke around 12:20am on August 2nd of 2012, and just as I walked outside I looked up into the sky.  I spotted this weird thing, and quickly pointed it out to my fiance because I thought my eyes were playing tricks.  But no, he saw it too.  It was this, almost orb of fire hovering across the sky. 
 
My fiance almost thought it looked like someone had shot a flare up into the sky, but it just flew in a straight line, no trail behind it.  It was going about as fast as a plane does when you see them in the sky, but it was a lot closer than a plane.  Almost maybe as high up as a 80 story building. I'm just guesstimating here.  But it was moving at a decent speed, but slow enough to follow for a few minutes. 
 
Both me and my fiance caught it on our camera phones.  My camera wasn't to good on the quality, but I'm still going to try and upload it somewhere.  The orb was like a fire color, a little orange, some red, and a little white at the edge.  The camera didn't pick it up that way though.  Me and him followed it for as long as possible, which about a few minutes, before the flame look went away and all we were able to see was a dark grey disk fade behind the tree's.  There was no sound to the strange thing, not like a plane would give off, no crash sound later on from like a meteor, no tail on the thing trailing behind it, just a fiery orb floating across the sky. 
 
I had posted the story on my Facebook, onto my paranormal web site, to see if anyone could help to identify it. And then someone sent me a link to this site.

One will start to rise over the mountain top into view and come up, and continue going up, along with the second brightest one about 15-20 minutes later (also there was only one in sky for the first 3 days).

I've called the yakima training center and of course have gotten no response. It freaked me out so bad the day I saw it, I actually called the police lol.  They said a police office was enroute to check things out; but they never showed. I have a couple video's of it from the night I first saw it, and have sent them to the new's station for a possible explanation but no response either.

Here is what I saw:  At 7:05 P.M.on 10-27-15,  I  was sitting outside on my patio in Yakima Washington.  It was dark outside.  The sky conditions were mostly cloudy and the nearly full moon had not yet arisen.   
 
I saw two distinct white round objects about 30 degrees above the horizon in the NNW part ofthe sky.  They were of the same light intensity and size.  They moved for about two seconds almost parallel to the horizon in a ENE direction.  One object moved in a somewhat skewed trajectory from the trajectory of the other.  They were about the size in diameter 10 times the size of the average distant star.  Their speed was about 10 times that of a big plane you would see going overhead.  They traveled about 10 degrees across the sky in the two seconds.   
 
There was no streaming breakup of material as a falling meteorite would show before it disintegrated.  This sighting was certainly not two planes, and if it were meteors, they were travelling at the wrong angle to the earth (almost parallel) and were the most uniform equally sized circular meteorites I have ever seen.   
 
I hope someone else witnessed this.

I went into my backyard, as I always do, and I looked up into the sky,  (I am a long time respected investigator/researcher, citizen scientist)  There was a light storm approaching from the West, with light broken clouds . 
 
I immediately noticed 2 white balls of light moving perfectly together (when I held my hand up they were about the length of my hand from light to light), but then I saw there was a third light forming a triangle and this was coming from the East over Badger Mountain and flew over me going West into the storm,   
 
Then I noticed another one, 3 lights forming a massive triangle these were moving fairly slow but perfectly in unison with each other, then right next to it there was  another one and behind it another one, there were about 5 to 6 giant triangles that I saw  all moving together heading West over the twin peaks area,    
 
I ran inside and grabbed my camera and tried to get a picture of the formation but could only get 2 lights in the pictures I took, when I zoom in on the lights there seems to be more than one object and   very strange forms .

I was in my backyard on March 5th looking at the stars.  At approximately 6:15 PM, I saw what I thought was a bright star in the South East sky.  After watching it for about a minute, I realized it wasn't a star... that it was moving, and heading in a North West direction.  I decided to start filming it with my i-phone just in case it wasn't an airplane.  After filming it for about 30 seconds or so, it just suddenly disappeared in the sky.  It was clear that night, with no clouds. 
 
I didn't think it was a plane because it didn't flash any colored lights.  It was a bright light that looked similar to the ISS, but I knew it wasn't.  The ISS usually comes from the other direction.  I also checked the schedule to see if it was going over at that time, and it wasn't.

I live in the Silverlake section of Los Angeles and I was having coffee at an outdoor table when I noticed what looked like a round white thing in the sky.  It was very high up and was moving north.  
 
After a few seconds, it turned right and headed west in a straight line and at the same speed.  A few minutes later, I and my girlfriend noticed other objects like the one I have described and for the next hour and a half we watched 14 or  more of them moving west in a straight line and one consistant speed which was rather slow.  
 
Most of the objects looked round but some were triangle shaped.  Most were moving slowly west but, some just hoovered in one spot.  One hoovered for 30 min and then slowly moved north.  
 
I went to the army surplus across the street and told the guys working there about the objects.  They got some binoculars and we looked at one of the objects.  Through the bino's I could see that the object was 3 white orbs held in a triangle frame like thing.  And as we watched another white object moved toward this 3-orbed object and was very neat it before it vanished.  
 
All of the objects were very high up.  When jets would pass by , one could see that these objects were way higher in the sky than the jets. 
 
The objects made no sound , they made turns, changed directions , and moved in straight lines as well as hovering.  NO high speed stuff.   
 
One thing I noticed, when I was looking at some of these objects, I would notice another similar object  behind the object I was looking at that was much much higher up.

I was driving on the 405 freeway heading south.  As I was driving through the Sepulveda pass I noticed a bright white light.  I believed this to be a very bright star at first impression.  I noticed it moving very slowly from the West heading East over the freeway.  It moved slower than a plane or a helicopter would travel and then as I proceeded to start driving almost directly underneath I could tell then that there were actually two unidentified flying objects. 
 
At this point in time now (approximately five minutes after my initial sighting) I could tell that there were two objects; one craft was distinctly triangular in shape and had a different colored light at each corner. One light was red, the other was green, and the other was a faint greenish/whitish color.  The lights were going off in an irregular pattern. 
 
The other UFO was hard to look at, as the two white lights on it were so bright, I was not able to tell the space of the object itself.  Both of the UFOS were now absolutely stationary in the sky directly over the 405 freeway near Westwood.  They were not moving at all for approximately five minutes, and after that point my car had driven far too south on the freeway for this scene to still be in my view.

Alright.  It's late on Wednesday night, and my associate spotted a strange formation of lights outside his window in the northeast sky.  He lives several miles out of town.  When he went to look out a different window, the lights had gone from a horizontal formation to a vertical one. then he lost contact with the craft.  He called a local resident and informed him of the sighting.  He went outside and saw it, facing north towards Davenport over highway 28.   
 
He proceeded to pursue the craft down the highway as it flew in line with the highway at an altitude of 150 feet AGL.  He couldn't see it while driving except for when he turned around, it was vaguely visible in the distance.  He estimates it was 20 to 30 miles away at this point.  
 
About an hour later, an intrigued young man heard of the sighting and accompanied the truck driver to a point near the Star Barn Road which is west on the way to Sprague.  We watched for a while from the field we were in and saw nothing! at first.   
 
After a while we noticed a flash in some large dark clouds. Its about 10:30 pm at this point.  We thought the flashes were lightning but there was no thunder. It was more of a slow strobing light. And it was moving through the clouds in a northeasterly trajectory.  It emerged from the clouds and was the same craft that was spotted earlier. It was flying very low and unnaturally slowly and was perfectly silent.  Especially considering its low altitude and large size.   
 
My associate is a pilot and he agreed that it was no airplane.  It continued flying towards spokane and continued into the distance.  In the direction of spokane we spotted a strange light hovering over the horizon. (separate from the craft.  It was also visible in addition to it.)  There was a strange pulsing red glow on the horizon.  We estimate it was located several miles away.  The original craft appeared to be directly over it. 
 
Suddenly another light appeared over the craft and was darting to and fro li! ke a firefly but miles away. the light on the horizon wavered for a moment and slowly lowered until it disappeared.  
 
We drove in the general direction of the lights to investigate when suddenly all the lights disappeared.  
 
After searching again, we gave up and went home.

I was cleaning my pool in my backyard when one of my children came out to see if the pool was ready (I was already out there for about 30 minutes) the time was about 3:38pm when something caught my attention in the sky above us.  There was this white sphere the was just hovering there at the high noon, in the sky.  I first got my cellphone to take pictures then record video.  But after a few minutes I needed something better to get a closer look at the object. I told my child to get my high zoom digital camera and then I started afterwards to take pictures and videos.  There was one main white sphere/egg object, multiple small shiny objects moving or shooting around the sky  randomly, another white sphere like object but small and one white/greenish sphere.  The main object would stay in one spot for a few minutes then would move at a creeping pace then stop again. It did that for the rest of the sighting.  At one time there was a shiny small object going down next to the main obj! ect then make a 90 degree turn upward. After that it made another slight turn then disappeared. I was recording at that point and the camera went out of focus. It kept moving west from the east towards to horizon (sunset area). At about 6:20pm before I went inside the house the main object disappeared at about 30 degrees from the horizon to the west. All of that happened in that time frame.

I was on my 2 story roof when I suddenly saw a weird light low to the ground in the eastern sky and what seemed to be a very far distance away.  When I looked it looked very strange to me.  I went and grabbed my binoculars and to my amazement I saw a literal saucer shaped UFO.  I am 16 years old and this looked like something of a movie. It had a single pulsating red light on top. a green light on one side and red light on other side. Similar to airplane but not an airplane. I am an airplane enthusiast and know exactly what a plane or helicopter looks like. It was not a blimp either. It seemed low to the ground maybe no more than 2,000 feet in the air. It was hovering in certain area. It would go farther away and appear to be a tiny spec of a star. Then it would come back a little closer and I could see the lights on it. When it was closer I could use my high powered binoculars to see the very distinct shape of a saucer. I could not believe my eyes. It was hove! ring and slowly moving in what seemed to be a particular patter. Farther away then coming back and slowly going left and right. After watching it for about 1 hour. I when inside my house to the downstairs and talked to my mom and old her what I saw. I actually drew a picture of exactly what I saw. After about 15 minutes I came back up on my roof to see if it was still there. And when i went out I couldn't believe my eyes, it had somehow moved from what seemed to be over 50-100 miles away to less that 10-20 miles away. It moved from the eastern sky to northern  sky and still remained very low to the ground. I could really see it with the binoculars and called one of my brothers friend who was in my backyard to come on the roof and see it. He saw it and didn't know what it was. From the point when I first came back onto the roof and saw how far it moved, it was slowly moving the the West and disappeared from my eyesight possibly over the ocean. I can;t believe anybody else di! d not report it. It was so real and distinct and I knew that I! was loo king at something from out of this world. Please believe me. I called news stations and they wanted video proof. I did not have a camera and my cell phone camera would have not picked it up. This was real and it was over the entire Los Angeles area.

At about 1:00PM on 4-24-10, I looked into the sky at a 2 man airplane when i noticed right above it was this very small, white, ball like object. I was at the skate park at the time of the incident so I pointed the object out to a couple of freinds.  We kept following it with our eyes and another object of the same shape popped up out of nowhere right next to the first.  We were in awe and were getting exited that the whole park of about 20 people wittnessed the same sight we were seeing.  We kept following the objects when more and more of the same objects were appearing. Some were close to eachother and some were spread out.  About an 1 hour and a half one of the objects went stationary while two objects came near the stationary object and went into a triangle formation. The formation was stationary for about 15 minutes and then flew away faster than anything Ive ever seen.  Soon after that an airforce jet flew by without a smoke trail and sound.

At ~1750 hours on 01/14/12, I was looking due south out toward the ocean and saw a bright light / orb out over the horizon at approximately ten degrees elevation.  It was roughly similar in brightness and size as the planet Venus appeared at that time.  Visibility was good as I could see San Clemente island and the sun had recently set. 
 
The object was moving at significant speed from left to right and with a motion like a gentle sine wave for what I'd estimate was several hundred miles.  It abruptly corkscrewed downward toward the point at which the water met the horizon and appeared to skate across the top of the water still out near the horizon.  It then began to move toward my location/the coast ""skating"" across the top of the water with the same gentle sine wave motion only back and forth laterally now rather than vertically as before. 
 
The orb appeared to get very close to the beach and then turned around and headed back out toward the horizon and began to gain altitude.  It returned to something near its original altitude and near where I first observed it out over the horizon.  It again executed a helical / corkscrew turn down to the water and approached the coast again where it appeared to vanish into the ocean approximately one mile or less offshore.

Spotted a large bright light out my driver’s side window while heading out of Dana Point, Ca, towards Interstate 5 on ramps.  It seemed to be turning towards me at the time and was at about my 10 o'clock.  The light it was emanating was reminiscent of the light from Venus in early morning.  My first reaction was that it was unusual but then I considered the possibility that it was a helicopter or airplane. It’s movements changed from stationary to large dramatic circular motions.  The light would also change from small (appeared to be 3 small lights) to one big wide and much brighter light.  I tried to find a good place to stop but could not so I hoped on the 5 north and pulled off on the next exit.  I watched it in my rear view mirror the whole time.  I pulled to the end of a dead end street and attempted to get some video of the object.  There was another person parked not far from where I stopped.  I watched it continue to bounce and dance in strange patterns with its ever changing brightness and altitude. I filmed with my camera phone zoomed in as far as it could go.  Unfortunately it does freeze several times but the movement is still apparent. I was approximately 1 mile north of where I first spotted it.  As I was heading back to my car the other car that was parked pulled up and the gentleman had a video camera.  He addressed me by saying, “ what the hell is that thing?”   I told him I didn't know but that I thought it almost looked like a kite with lights attached.  He pointed out that it was really large as it was clearly viewable from over a mile away.  He said he was heading south to attempt to get a better view.

It was about 9:15 pm and I was walking home from our local high school football game with my 2 sons when I noticed a red fireball about 30,000 ft elevation that seemed to drop a white glowing ball. Within a minute it dropped two more red glowing balls, each one dropped at least one white ball each. 
 
I immediately called my wife and daughter who were at home. They ran outside and saw 3 red balls in the sky, in a v shape formation. 1 of the balls seemed to flare up and another red ball dropped from it.  My wife and sons state they heard a loud popping noise.  The ball that dropped seemed to fade away and then the same thing happened again.  The remaining 2 balls moved north and then vanished.

I was standing in my driveway smoking a cigarette, facing the street.  For some reason, I turned around and looked above my house, and in the distance, I saw the object.  It looked like a horseshoe only sideways and it was all light and emitting a sort of glow around everything but the center.   
 
I screamed to my wife, “Look up at the sky!”, she was in the backyard letting my puppy out.   She came out to the front yard when she heard me screaming but by the time she came out it was gone.  It was moving very slowly over the horizon, the center of the object was a very bright orb, like a bright star, but the outer shape, the horseshoe-like tail was all red and leaving a trail, like a hazy glow.  
 
It glided by for about 20 seconds and in an instant, it flashed into nothing.  It honestly scared me, my hairs all stood up and I was breathing heavily.  When it happened, I brought out my phone to record it but when I checked it, nothing had shown up on the video.  This has been the strangest thing I have ever seen in the sky.

As I was driving westbound adjacent to the 91 freeway I noticed 3 small spheres flying in formation and moving faster than a helicopter or plane would.  They were headed in one direction; south. They were high in the air; if I had to guess I would say about 3000 feet. They were very reflective which is how I spotted them to begin with.  As they flew across the sky they were headed toward Lake Matthews. One split off from their formation and led the other two. About five seconds after that I lost sight of them. 
 
This is my first UFO sighting and have heard of many that are not recorded. I've seen and have been around aircraft (former US Navy, stationed on an aircraft carrier). I am sure of what I saw.

The security camera in the driveway recorded what appear to be at least 2 or more unidentified flying objects.  It was an especially windy morning and the sun was just rising. 
 
About the camera: The camera self-adjusts to color from night to day.  The camera is a Sony PTZ but I couldn’t zoom in any farther as the camera is in a fixed location; I can only zoom to the center of that view.  The camera is facing east.  I can only save whole minutes of video to the Lorex HD/system.  Sorry for the long wait before it actually starts. 
 
The UFO’s seem to be coming in straight towards the camera, which is facing east, and also recede in the same direction from whence it/they came.  From the video it seems that first there is one UFO and then another just pops into view at 06:01:52. 
 
There may be more than 2 objects.  It’s really difficult to tell as the wind keeps blowing the tree branches which partly obscure the view towards the end.  I don’t believe these objects to be planets. 
 
So, basically UFO appears from the east and then another UFO slowly comes into the view just to the left of the first one.  Then the first one is not really visible when a UFO suddenly pops into view again just to the left of the second one.  Then possibly the first and second one merges.  It's hard to tell if one is just behind the other or if it has merged with it instead or left altogether.  All then seem to come a bit closer before finally receding in the same direction that it/they came from. 
 
There is an airport, Ontario International (ONT), in nearby Ontario but the flight airways are more to the right/south coming in over Riverside.  Also, airplanes don't stay in one place as these objects did.  While helicopters can hover in place these objects do not fit the shape and made no sound.  At any rate I didn't notice any red or green lights that aircraft are required to have. 
 
I'm above average intelligence and not prone to making things up.  The video is 128mb avi file format.",34.0662,-117.3993

We see these sphere shapes crafts in the sky on a regular basis. The have white and red lights, but are completely silent.  The hover extemely low.  Once the notice us looking or trying to photograph the craft, it looks as though a shield closes blocking the light and then it disappers almost as if it vanishes. These crafts are roughly the diamater of an oridaniary fisbee, but the shape of a sphere.  When notice them while laying in bed at night, they get really close to our open windows and shine their bright lights, but as soon as they know that we see them they back away, turn of the light, but we can still see them.  These crafts appear to be highly intelligent and sneaky.  Whatever these are they are completely silent.  We don't know of any government or other craft with this kind of technology.  Has there been any other reports like ours?  Also, once they back away they moved way high in the sky, turn their light back on pretending to be a star.  An th! en they move away super slow, and the all come together into a cluster, and then they all went in different directions. 
 
Please help us figure this out, we are getting more affraid of these crafts.  they keep getting closer and closer to our bedroom windows, so now we have to keep them closed.  we don't understand why us, and what's going on, or what they might try to do to us.  please help us get piece of mind.  we didn't know who else to turn too.  its not like we can go to the police.  they would just blow us off and call us crazy. we try to take pictures of them but they never come out right or the crafts vanish.  and when we look at them through our binoculars, they look multi-colored, but to the naked eye they are always white/red. We have sightings of these crafts for about the last year, in the beginning it was only one craft in the distance,  now its multiple crafts at least 5 exteremely close.  they are getting closer and closer and that is what is scaring us and making us very nervious and concerned.",33.73991977,-116.9976389

After awhile they broke into 6 per group and came together with 5 of the six forming a U shape with 6th one in the middle, after hours of observing the orbs they all broke formation and lined up individualy in single file from one end of the sky to the other like if it was roll call as the lone orbe came over and after a few minutes some went back in to Triangle formations while others broke into pairs and zipped through the sky like if they were rubber balls jerking left right up and down like a streak of speed.  I noticed several falling stars throughout the ! night and also noticed when air craft pass by they dim out and as they pass get bright again.  We observed alot of unexplained events the entire night such as 3 bodies standing in the road visual only to the video camera but could not see them in plain view.  The middle one was about 8ft tall like a floating shadow with two shorter being standing on each side in white clothing just standing there then i noticed the video didnt save but started recording again and caught them moving across the ground in a blue color haze to the left of us.  Then seen what seemed bright head lights coming of the hill side coming straight for my uncle and i, we had atleast 20 sec to discuss who it could be clear out here, maybe fish and game, maybe rancher, spot lighter, or bird hunter when it got about 20 yards away it turned the lights off and i instintly grabbed my head light switch turning on my lights but didn't see any road off the steep rough mountain side and there was no vehicle to be seen.  I think i dosed off about 3:30am to awaking to my uncle telling me he's been watching these headlights behind us about 300 yrds away and said it looked like the head lights were traveling on a road going up and down but not bouncing.  I said show me were and drove to the location of the lights and observed a structure that was built outta twigs and woven together that resembled a hound dog with a tail and had u branch straight through it coming up above the structure looked like something outta dr suess book.  It stood in resemblance of a igloo stood about 4 1/2 feet and as long as 12ft i have video and pictures of the events theres much more but im burnt on typing lol sorry.

It caught my attention when the flashes changed from blue to white and sometimes red.  The flashes were at different brightness and sometimes the white light would even strobe.   
 
I believe it was a triangle because there seemed to be a large mass not quite lit up on the side where I was watching.  The ship moved in fast motions.  Some points it would do a lazy sideways figure eight and it would begin to quickly fly one direction then would quickly ""change its mind"" and zoom back to its beginning spot.  It dropped little stars which I assume are ships, some underneath of it and twp shot out of the sides and shot up in an arch formation over the Meridian Speedway.   
 
The big UFO with the lights continued to wobble in its spot while these very visible smaller ships went out if vision.  Then one of OUR aircraft with four big flashlights coming off all four sides seemed to have let some of its own ships go because I quickly saw two bright blinks in the sky separate from each other, but close to where the aircraft had just passed.  As I watched the UFO it slowly lowered out of my vision and made quite a light display along the way.  It left my vision at 6:16 floating over Middleton.  I believe it was flashing lights on our houses.

I got so excited i started flashing my flashlight that direction from bedroom window.It moved away.   
 
A week later it was back around the same time and i woke up my girlfriend to see this object,it was silent i flashed my light it blinked out.another 2 weeks later at the same spot same time The top cave was lighted up bright white  and the UFO was 50  ft away from the cave tilted at an angle  hovering like its looking into the cave.No lights were shining at that direction  into the cave and yet the cave was lighted up meaning so! me kind of activity is taking place.  The UFO was bigger.and brighter all  5 individual white lights in the UFO  was bright and hovered at that spot,Meanwhile i got excited and i shined my laser light at that direction and went down to my kitchen and opened my kitchen door facing the garage , just then i heard a clicking noise in my right ear (like a dolphin makes),..I did not open my garage door and ignored the noise which went away and returned to my bedroom and it was gone,both lights blinked out including the cave light.I left the country for few months and hope to follow up on my return.We need to respect their presence .People get facinated with UFOs and yet despise the Aliens like some kind of Freaks.Ufos are nothing without the aliens so dont freak out if you are not prepared to accept them.

03.31.2011	South West Las Vegas, NV  approximately 3:30pm	(sunny clear skies)   Yesterday I was enjoying the day in my backyard talking on the phone, when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye.  A huge dark thing was floating sideways and up into the air.  I told the person on the phone, “oh that’s odd, kinda’ looks like a metallic balloon has been let go into the sky by someone.  And it did look like that, a grey/black sorta’ metallic looking with an occasional extremely bright light omitting periodically. 
 
Rationalizing that it is a balloon I let my attention stray. 
 
A few minutes pass and I look to the sky to see the progress of flight. To my surprise, the “balloon” is not where I thought it would be. In fact, it appears to be stationary and not as high as expected. Now it has my full attention. 
 
I watch as the dark mass with the bright light glided horizontally towards the North West of the valley. Watching in disbelief and curiosity, after a few minutes, I witness it angle and then turn back towards the SW, towards me. I am now talking to my mom on the phone (trying to direct her view to see what I am seeing), the unidentified flying object is now heading directly towards me. I am sure it was just my perception, but the object was flying then stopped, what seem to be directly over me and then began to hover. A full minute passed and I noticed the bright light was still as intense but the dark matter was dissipating. I realized the craft was now starting to ascend. Several moments passed as it continued to hover and rise. Then it slowly drifted towards the North East. 
 
My experience was over. 
 
I always believed, just too much credible information not to, I just never thought I would get the opportunity to experience such an anomaly with my own two eyes. 
 
I am not looking for validation, I am just sharing my experience.

Went out to walk my dog and noticed a very bright light much like an jet coming in for landing.  Light drifted slowly down stopping at one point.  Took photo with my cell phone camera before it went behind houses.  I could see in the moonlight and city lights a ""smoke"" trail left where object came down.  To give you and idea of brightness, in the photo it is about half as bright as street lights also in photo.  I suppose it may have been a miltary flare dropped from aircraft.

Multiple sightings between November 2013 and January 2015 (when this report was filed)  Multiple sightings of a confirmed hoax craft;  And a single sighting of one possible test craft from Area 51 or Nellis AFB   
 
Location:  State Route 318 from Lund to Hiko and continuing south along US 93 to just south of Alamo. 
    
Observer:  Individual who frequently (sometimes weekly) travels back and forth between northern and southern Nevada along US 93 and SR 318. 
 
Object #1:  Multiple nighttime sightings of what I have since learned is a cool, but not hugely secret (to locals, anyway) hoax ""UFO"" - a small aircraft with a custom (perhaps programmable) array of animated red lights that is flown at low altitude through the White River Valley between Lund (at the north end) and Hiko (at the south end) along State Route 318, and then continuing into the Pahranagat Valley down to Ash Springs and Alamo, just south of where 318 dead ends into 93. 
 
For uninformed nighttime travelers, this craft would easily be a startling sight, as the operators activate the lights intermittently along a meandering flight route.  I have seen the craft most often in the vicinity of White River Narrows, a short stretch of canyon through which 318 winds just north of Hiko.  During the most recent sighting (in December 2014, I believe), I was concerned that the craft was being flown in hazardous weather conditions - high winds and rain/snow, a risky venture for the operators if they were in it ... or for the craft if it's just a remote.  The craft appears to have no fixed or flashing running lights (FAA violation?), so until the red light array is activated, it is basically invisible.  The effect is rather striking, though, because the light pattern is different each time - reminds me of the animated light patterns on the side of some blimps, but appears to be on the underside/underwing of the craft. 
 
Didn't get details of why this craft is being flown (I've only seen it at night), but it could just be for fun or publicity to spice up interest in the mystique of the area with its adjacency to Area 51, which lies west of here off State Route 375 going toward Rachel.  There are a few Area 51-themed tourist attractions and businesses in this area, including E.T. Beef Jerky (right at the junction of 318 and 93), The Alien Research Center (just a short distance up 375 after it splits off from 318), which is more a gimmicky Sci-Fi memorabilia shop than any genuine ""research center.""  Also up 375 is the Little A-lé-inn (spelling?) in Rachel, which is a good ways north of the famous/infamous ""Black Mailbox"" and main turnoff to get to Area 51 (there are actually several ... but not necessarily passenger-car-friendly ... access roads and backways into the property that comprises Area 51 - travel along them is highly inadvisable).  Maybe the operators of this craf! t are just playing into the lingering appeal of this area to UFO seekers from afar.  Pretty clever, but risky.  This report is just an explanation of this particular object to any ""newbies"" who see it for the first time and wonder if it might be extraterrestrial.  This one is not. 
 
Object #2: Some type of craft (likely a high-performance jet) performing dizzying maneuvers above the Hiko/Ash Springs/Alamo area near where SR 318 and US 93 intersect. 
 
I witnessed this craft on a cold winter day in early 2014, when the sky was crystal clear ... other than the (perhaps unintended?) contrail that made it possible for me to track the movement of the craft, if not actually see it (it was either at very high altitude or very small and at low altitude). 
 
The contrail appeared intermittently, as though the craft was hitting pockets of very cold air along its path (much like one might see from a jetliner passing high overhead through variable air masses). 
 
Cannot say if this was a manned or remotely controlled craft, but it was making some very sharp, sudden turns and loops that were far beyond what I believe to be the envelope of most known fighter planes, including those I have observed at air shows or conducting military practice maneuvers.  Possible sources:  Area 51, which is not far from here, or Nellis AFB, which lies about 80 - 90 miles south of here.  Pretty sure it was not just the Thunderbirds, whose home base is Nellis.  They usually stick close to Vegas and in a group.  This was an individual craft.  Wondering if anyone else has seen this type of craft executing similar aerobatics in this area.

Thursday night at approximately 7:46 PM, I spotted a brilliant amber light in the North/ Western sky. I was sitting, facing East and the California side of the horizon from my home in Arizona.  I am very, very familiar with the flight patterns from L.A. to Phoenix and back.  Those travel East to West and visa versa and only shift latterly North and South depending on weather and other circumstances.  I'll say that I see A LOT of interesting things in the sky and often around here.  This one was absolutely amazing.  Once I realized it was not a plane, I thought it could be the space shuttle.  That had landed the day before so that was out.  I then reasoned that it was the Mir.  I ran and grabbed my binoculars to confirm. Not so much.  I've seen the Mir 3 times in the last 5 years - Once with my naked eye at about the same time at night, once through my 12"" dobby telescope and one other time just after dusk with my naked eye.  This was not the Mir to the best of my know! ledge.  It glowed more brightly than any star in the sky.  It was a distinct orange ""glow"" which looks similar to reflected light from the Shuttle and Mir but through my binoculars, the light was steady, unwavering and stayed the same luminosity across the entire night sky.  It travelled at approximately 1400 mph.  I am basing that on what I have watched hundreds of times, commercial airliners traveling at anywhere from 600 to 700 mph.  I could not tell altitude beyond about 30,000 feet.  Through the binoculars, I could not make out any formation of wings, additional lights/strobes or physical features.  To me, it looked exactly like a brightly glowing disk since the light was not round.  It was very slightly oval.  There was no atmospheric disruption that I could see.  There was no propulsion or exhaust that I could see - Just a very bright and very steady moving object traveling from North to South in the clean night sky.  The moon was visible but only a quarter-moon washed out the stars.",34.47572118,-114.2589941

The planes flew right underneath three of the lights but there were no indications the pilots seen the objects.  The objects that were in the plane's path moved quickly away while the others kept moving in a westward direction.  I opened my windows to see if I could hear anything after the planes went by but there was absolutely no noise. 
 
Some of the objects went from white to orange back to white lights and traveled towards the Pintlar Mountain Range.

Granite Mt still looked the same with rocks, it was light tan.  I also noticed that there was some flat areas in the valley, but to me it could have been gray smoke. I kept staring at the haze and Mts in the distance as we went around turns and up and down hills.  I then remembered that there are no mesa tops in Prescott and told Terrie to look at what I am seeing.  She confirmed that they are flat mesa's with protruding tops.  We saw two big ones and one small one very clear and square in the distance.  It also looked like some pointed poles below the tops, which were very pointed at each end.  They were all one med gray color and very large.! There was no shadows or land layers to see. As we drive about 67 mph, we see the left side of the middle mesa start to distort and change. The white disc is now vanished some how and the left areas are distorting and some things can be seen moving.  We lost view from trees and rock hill.  When we came out, we saw Granite Mt some other hills and Mts in the valley.  They had different shades of color and looked normal in the distance. They looked much smaller now with depth.

I was driving home going west on Bell Road, past the 51 Freeway by a few minutes.  I stopped for a red light.  There were monsoon clouds in the distance, but something closer caught my eye as I was waiting.  This ""cloud"" was unusually bright--white.  I looked at it and realized that it wasn't a cloud--it was too small in the foreground, very white/illuminated, and had a very distinctive (not blurry around the ends like a cloud) shape.  The light was shaped like a skinny oval.  From the top, the oval wasn't flat but graduated up towards the center about 15 degrees.  Suddenly, from each end a beam of a similar bright light (thin like a string) shot out at the same time then this ""shape"" shot straight up and was gone.",33.50378574,-112.0770802

After dozing off to sleep while sleeping outside on my back, I suddenly awoke to see a massive object descending toward me from above.  It appeared  half the size of my outstretched hand until it reached its closest point, then appearing the full size of my outstretched hand held at arm’s length from my body.   
 
The object seemed to be the size of a large house or larger.  It was not illuminated (and appeared dark in color with some irregular features that seemed to reflect light) but seemed to be a large creature of some sort (resembling a beetle as seen from below).   
 
It also appeared to resemble a dark colored octopus as seen from below, but with tentacles much shorter (each only a quarter the thickness of its body) and more wirery than those on an octopus.  The ‘tentacles’  (approximately ten or twenty located around its periphery), in fact were more like the cilia of a cell seen under a microscope.  These ‘cilia’, flagellated and shivered rapidly as if being rapidly blown by an erratic wind, yet the sky was very still (with no wind) and the object made no noise that I could hear (as a loud commercial jet was taking off from a nearby airport the moment I awoke).  The object had a highly organic look, as if it were a creature (maybe a large bug) of some type.   
 
After I’d watched it approach for about two seconds, I yelled thinking that it may crash into me.  The moment I yelled, it abruptly changed direction (without slowing down) and began moving away and to my right.  As it ascended to the right and away from me, it slowly faded away and vanished.

After picking up some dinner I was returning home with my girlfriend to my home when coming up the hill I noticed 4 distinct red lights in a unique formation not too far above the top of the mountain.  They looked like a red/orange light.  It caught my attention because I am in to astronomy and look at the night sky very often and having lived in that same home for over 17 years I have never seen any lights like this before.  As I pointed out the lights to my girlfriend I called my brother who was waiting for me at the house.  I told him to go outside and look at the lights.  As we are pulling into my drive way I noticed that the lights had dimmed and could only see one.  My brother was in the drive way when I parked in the garage and started yelling at me to get back out here.  I got back out and 1 bright red light had just become visible and it was rising ! in altitude!  As it was rising very slowly it reached a certain point in the sky and stopped and then starting to fade away in distance!   My brothers friend also witnessed this whole thing and having all of us lived in this area for at last 15 years and never have seen anything like this before!  this was truly an amazing sight to see.

My wife ((name deleted)), my son ((name deleted)), and I saw a mysterious phenomenon last night at approximately 8:30 pm. The attached pics and vids are taken from our front yard looking directly south. The property is located just northeast of Elliot and Val Vista Roads in Gilbert. 
 
 Initially, we saw an object streaking in the southeast sky heading west and descending in a diagonal trajectory.  It had a bright white light with a trailing tail and looked like a falling star, which is what I at first thought it was. It also appeared to be emitting sparks.  The object came to a stop at a position due south of our property and 45 degrees above the horizon.  The object held its position while emitting a significantly dimmer light. I originally thought that it was the spot where the falling star (meteor) had burnt out, but the light remained in the sky at the stopped position.  We continued to watch for several seconds, after which an object began to fall to the ground (perpendicular to the earth) . It seemed to emit a dim spot of light.  It traveled approximately 1/3 the distance to the ground and stopped. It then began heading east (horizontal to the earth).  At that point, the object was intensely bright and appeared to be emitting sparks very much like a fireworks display rocket. 
 
 Three additional objects did the same thing, creating a formation about 30 degrees above the horizon at a significant distance below and east of the original object.  They remained visible for several minutes, descending along looping trajectories until they disappeared below the horizon.

 As I was looking at it, slowly, my skepticism grew.  As I drove for another 5-6 seconds, I considered turning on and grabbing my video camera that I had in the car with me. I am doubtful when it comes to a UFO sighting (I've always wanted to see one) so I feel as if my mind plays tricks on me.   
 
This was no trick.  It was huge.  And as I drove with smy head out my drivers side window and stared, I rolled through a light.   
 
There were 3 ladies out running on the corner, and they had stopped to wait for the light.  I looked at them to see if they were seeing what I was seeing but it did not seem like it.   
 
The UFO hadn't left my sight.  So I turned my camera on and pulled into my neighborhood.  As I drove in, the houses blocked the UFO.   
 
When I returned to open road, couldn't have been more than 25-30 seconds, it was gone from sight.  It was then that a weird feeling started to kick in, almost of disappointment.   
 
It was huge in the sky. Impossible to miss.  Looked like a big black ring with a weird center type and a little tiny upside down triangle on the bottom.   
 
As soon as I saw it, it seemed to be gone.  I wish I would've shot a photo or shot some tape of the UFO but it was all over so fast.   
 
Still hard to believe.

I was driving North toward the Catalina Mountains when I turned my gaze to the left and was startled by an intense set of lights on a large, pitch-black object which appeared to be within 5-6 blocks West of my intersection.  I was startled by how large the object appeared to be compared to usual aircraft, how close it appeared to me, the intensity and unique semi-linear organization of the lights, and by the fact that the craft appeared to be stationary in the sky.  It was lower than a helicopter would typically be, but was larger and flatter than a helicopter. 
 
I immediately pulled over with the intent of getting a picture.  Once I was stopped and facing the object straight on, I noticed the rectangular shape and what appeared to be a projection on the far dorsal surface, with some of the lights set further back on the craft than others (in contrast to the semi-linear arrangement of my initial perspective).  Within about 3 seconds of me getting a good look at it from this view, it began a Southeast descent at only about 10mph faster than what I'd expect from a typical aircraft.   
 
At this point I considered that perhaps it was just a helicopter, but I did not hear any sound as it descended and the shape of the object was more bizarre from the sideview, appearing wide across and essentially flat.  One light flashed a couple of times at a quick/strobe-like rate while the others were larger, had a slightly more yellowish hue, and remained constant. 
 
I turned my car back around the way I'd initially come, to try and follow it, but by the time I had stopped at a stop sign and turned South, it had gone.  This seemed unusual to me because my view of the horizon was fairly good, and at the speed I had seen it travelling (55 miles at most) I fully expected to still see it after the ~5 seconds it took to get my car reoriented, but I saw no trace whatsoever. 
 
No one in surrounding cars seemed to see it, but I did feel uncomfortable with how low and near me it seemed, and I got the impression that it ""responded"" to me pulling over to face it because it had been hovering in the same spot while I was watching it while still driving, but started descending/moving away a very short time after I pulled over.  The only other thing I can think to note is that there had been a power outage 4-5 hours prior in that area, including outage for the traffic lights of the intersection I was at when I saw the object.",32.25017875,-110.9393242

Listen, I just looked out of my front window and noticed what I thought was Venus.  But what caught my eye immediately, was its erratic movement.  It moved slightly up, down, across---and sometimes it appeared to make a half circle.  The movements weren't all across the sky, either.   
 
This took place in a very small area.  A family member told me it was Venus due to atmospheric temperatures.  Is this true?  Anyway, I've been looking at Venus all my life and never seen it move.

We thought it might be the Neowise comet since it was in the Northwest but eveeything we read said that we would not have been able to see that with the naked eye. We didn't stay. We went on to our hotel but when we tried to see it from there, it was gone. We thought maybe there was too much light at the hotel but we saw this right above the street lights so that wasn't the problem. We have looked on subsequent nights and seen nothing more.

On the above date and at the listed time, I was on patrol with my partner and just exiting the parking lot of a hospital that we patrol. 
 
My partner was looking down at the tablet in which she was entering patrol information and I was looking eastbound out the window of the patrol car.  I observed a bright neon green fiery sphere shooting rapidly across the clear sky traveling from WNW to ESE. 
 
The sphere disappeared from view behind a nearby building. I heard no associated noise and saw no further activity.  At first, I thought it must be some type of fireworks, but it was larger than any firework I’d ever seen and there was no launching sound, traveling sound or any other balls of light.  Unfortunately, I had just minutes before shut off my dash cam which would have been sighted right towards the event. 
 
I let out an exclamation and my partner asked what was going on.  I asked her if she’d seen what I’d just seen without being specific and she replied no.  We cruised the area for a while looking for signs of fireworks or anything similar and there was nothing and no one in the immediate area.

At about sunset (17:00) very low on the northern horizon I saw what I first believed to be a bright star or planet. It was the only star visible in the evening sky at this time. I watched it for a few seconds before realizing it was moving east just slightly. 
 
 I asked my wife to come out and see it. I told her "" hey you see that star there, keep and eye on it for me will ya?"" I went inside to find binoculars. By the time I had come back out ( a few minutes later) my wife had witnessed the object move slowly and evenly a great deal eastward, before it came to a complete stop. 
 
 When viewed through the binoculars the object appeared to be a single dot of white light. We had time to set up a telescope on the now stationary object and through this the object appeared to be scintillating with all colors but was still a very small and indistinguishable dot of light with no features. 
 
 I shot the object with a compass and shot where I had originally observed it. The object had moved from almost due north to 44 degrees and at an angle of approximately 15 degrees. The time was noted as 17:44. 
 
 We continued to observe the object periodically through the evening and it appeared to melt into the rest of the night sky and rose with the rest of the night objects around it. At about 20:00 a haze moved in and the object was no longer distinguishable from other heavenly bodies.

This is a descriptive account of two incidents of personal eyewitness accounts of a reddish orange orb.  The first indecent occurred on January 20th at approximately 10:20 pm in SW New Mexico, just outside of Silver City. 
 
At first there were three of us outside, me, m and c.  We were about to leave m's house when I saw what appeared to be a plane and some distance behind it and approaching it quickly was a reddish/orange orb.  There was a distinct difference in the speed of the orb and the speed of the plane.  The orb was obviously traveling faster than the plane. 
 
Then a second plane was visible behind the orb, and all were traveling together (plane, orb, plane) with the orb somewhat lower than the two planes.  It was peculiar that there was no sound from these planes or orb.  We were out in the outskirts of town where it was very quite and we could hear very well, that there were no jet engines.  Then, as all three objects are flying due west, the orb shakes up and down violently a  very small distance, shaking the planes up and down as well. 
 
Next was beyond belief.  The orb very obviously sped up to the first plane and went into or behind it, disappearing from view.  It almost immediately came out as 2 orbs of identical color.  It is vital to note that the orb was not only much smaller than the outline of the lights on the planes, but that it did not flash like the planes did.  These planes also did not flash like the regular commercial flashing plane light.  The planes seemed to be communicating with each other using their lights, it did look like Morse code, now that I replay it in my mind.  (My current hypothesis is that the orb had already taken control of the planes by the time I had seen them, and all the pilots had to communicate with one another was their lights!) Immediately after the 2 orbs came out of the plane in front, all of the objects lights' turned out, the orb was dim like a star, as were the planes, most strange, at the same time this happened, they all turned towards the south and merged to form an equilateral triangle with the point directed upwards, facing us.  This triangle appeared to have a mass connecting the lights. 
 
There were no clouds in the sky, the stars were very bright, and the light of the city was blocked by a ridge.  The triangle slowed down its movement to a crawl yet still covered a massive distance very quickly, circling from West, to South, to East, and finally North East while it disappeared into what appeared to be space. 
 
Not five or ten minutes later c and I were preparing to depart from m's, we were amazed to see the reddish/orange orb floating straight up from the north.  I thought to myself what would I do to communicate with this orb, and I thought maybe I would whistle.  Before I could even whistle and directly after the thought, the orb light went out.  The star sized light that remained floated upward and southwest until it realized two more jets were coming in from the north east.  I heard the roar of the jets  as they flew the trail of the orb all the way over us towards the North and West, south into Mexico. 
 
Tonight, January 24th , 2012, I was witness again to this phenomenon, yet it was slightly different.  I was sitting on my front porch facing South West when I saw the red light again, this time smaller and what appeared to be 2 orbs very close to one another and fainter.  It was also earlier in the evening, approximately 8:20 pm, and the city lights reduce visibility.  Still the stars are highly visible in Silver City, NM.  I watched as the pair of orbs moved in a similar flight path as the Friday night before.  The lights pulsated or flashed irregularly, almost more of a pulsation.  It went from West, to South, to East, and disappeared behind the trees.  I watched it circle around 3 times before it disappeared the final time. 
 
But before it dipped behind the trees for the last time, it glowed a brilliant orange/red much brighter and larger than the orbs we had seen the previous Friday.  It quickly faded and went away behind the trees.  It was interesting to see how the flight path of these pair of orbs was directly compared to that of observable commercial flights at the time and to note the irregular flight path of the paired orbs, and the straight path of the commercial flights. 
 
The paired orbs traveled at a much higher speed than that of the observable commercial flights.  They also had no noise.  This where it is puzzling.  Very soon after the orb glowed that burst of orange/red light, it went away, and minutes later 2 fighter jets zoomed by, completely audible and loud, just like the 2 jets that went after the one orb on Friday.  But unlike those two that pursued the orb into Mexico, these two jets did not appear to know where they were going, just going really fast in the same flight path as where the paired orbs were 5 minutes prior, and pretty much where the first occurrence turned into an equilateral triangle. 
 
Yet when we first witnessed this on Friday, there was no noise when the planes were incorporated into this triangle, and there was no noise tonight with the paired orbs, we could hear the commercial flights when they passed by, we could hear the Air Force jets zooming by, but no, we could not hear the orbs at all.  The whole time the orbs flew with remarkable speed and smoothness, and made irregular and seemingly impossible movements, like moving a large distance while appearing to move slowly.  This was particularly present in the triangle form.",32.78889643,-108.2724536

It seems since you already have my phone number.  I would like to ask you to be discreet with the information you have already compiled.  I do not have good health, and had a new heart valve put in last March.  My wife and I are just a middle Grandmother and Grandfather.  I’m a 100% disabled veteran since 2004.  We are both 65 years of age.  Please Respect that?  
 
On Aug. 25th, 2017, at approximately 8:30 PM my wife and I were looking forward to getting to a location where we could get settled in for the night.  We were riding in our 37 foot Diesel Pusher at a speed of about 60 miles per hour, slightly downhill, travelling Southeast on highway 550, and a few miles south of Napeezi, New Mexico.  We had been talking about how the roads had changed 2 lanes to 4 lanes since the last time I had driven.   
 
Out of nowhere I saw a light flash in front of me, it had come from my left.  I instinctively looked to my left and I saw 2 creatures setting about 2 foot apart, very bright craft which was at my eye level while setting in the Motorhome. 
 
I instantly seemed to take a mind picture of what I was seeing.  At that time we were maybe 80 feet and gaining on their position. My first thought was is this real, the closer we got the more positive I was that what I was seeing was real when I made eye contact. 
 
Some points I saw was; The craft did not appear to have a windshield. 
 
The panel in behind the creatures gave off a very bright light, as did the floor and ceiling.  It was as bright as a operating room under full lighting.  There was as small stem that came up from the floor in front of the creatures.  It stood about 40 inches out of the floor.  It seemed to support a  small control panel that was thinner the a carton of cigarettes.  The guy on my left had his gopher looking hand resting on it. 
 
The moment I saw them, the individuals were looking down the road as if looking for something to arrive.  There was a truck coming up the hill toward us and about a 1/8th of a mile away.  The craft seemed to swing and rotate from the shoulder on the other side to a lane away was at my side and maybe 20 foot away.  Once they rotated enough that their faces was 180% to us, he saw us and disappeared.  As we drove on down the hill I looked in my mirrors and side camera and didn’t see anything related to them after that. 
 
A description of the creatures we witnessed: Both individuals had a skin tone about the same as mine, I’m a white male. They had large heads in a upside down teardrop shape, very large black eyes, a small mouth and 2 small holes for a nose.  There were holes for the ears but only a nub for ears.  Very much like the drawing you would see in Roswell, accept not green, but green uniforms.  The one on the right had a very smooth face. The one on the left appeared to be older with facial lines.  The one on my Left wrinkled his right side of his mouth when he saw me, but they were talking when we interrupted them. 
 
I made eye contact with the one on my left and looked directly into his large black eye.  His eye was the finest surface I had ever seen.  The eye had no abrasions or scratches , no dust or mucus.  I noticed  that under the surface of this perfectly clear outer surface of the eye was a grid of many individual eyes, like a Fly’s Eye’s but much smoother super fine glass surface. 
 
Their bodies where skinny and were illuminated with a greenish glowing uniform.  Also there was roll type cuffs  that also glowed, but was a beige. 
 
They reminded me of stick people.  The arms and the torso were slender and about the diameter of a very small child of 6  or 7 years of age. 
 
The hands reminded me of the shape of gophers.  But these creatures are large in height and reach, that hand appeared to me to be a lethal weapon. 
 
Their torso was long and skinny and appeared to be weak if depended on.  But I believe the suit they wear is their body strength. 
 
The back wall is very hard to explain because I believe however they traveled was behind that wall.  The wall was very brightly illuminated.  It appeared to be divided into about 18 inch cubes but wasn’t, it was a flat surface.  The light seemed to be boiling along the edges of each panel in the colors of light greenish, blue, violet.  But the power heaved with its changes it seemed.  The back panel was incredibly beautiful and something I’ll never forget it. 
 
We could not see the outer body of the craft because we were looking into very bright light. 
 
As for hearing anything, I felt I heard them communicating when we approached",36.1598,-107.7664

The moon was out during the morning of May 13 after walking my dog, I decided to set up my telescope (Celestron 8 SE) for some daytime viewing and photos with my smart phone. I was using a 25 mm Plossl lens on the telescope and did not use any lunar filters. 
 
 Shortly after the moon came into focus and while I was viewing features on the upper visible half, a large craft traversed its surface moving left to right coming into view for no more than 5 seconds, then disappearing into the blue sky.  It was close to the moon as it was in focus while I was simultaneously looking at lunar surface features. it was large and and moving fast.  It only took five seconds to cross the entire width of the moon! Unfortunately, I did not have my camera set up at the time of the event to get a photograph of the craft. 
 
 The craft was shape of an arrow with the front side coming to a tip and the backside curved inward.  The arrow shaped craft was formed by wide-sections of tubular metal, silver in appearance, hollow in the center with all tubular sections of equal dimension. The craft did not appear to have any windows.  Just solid metal across the entire structure.  I did not see any lights or obvious means of propulsion (see attached drawing). 
 
 I would have reported the event earlier, but I was initially concerned that my information would be made public.  I was concerned that if my name was released it could have affected my reputation and future job prospects as a retiree.  I recently determined that my concern was unfounded, so I decided to report the event to the hotline.

I was sitting outside at night with 3 other people in my backyard. It was around 10:40PM or so, nearing 11PM. From my backyard I am able to see a view of the El Paso mountains in the distance, and am able to see Transmountain Road, which is a long road that is a shortcut to get from the northeast side of town to the west side by cutting through rather than going around the mountain.  From our view you can see the headlights driving by from the cars in a certain area that drive by, but they are high up in elevation on the lower half of the mountain from the view we have. 
 
Two of us (myself and another) were sitting in the backyard facing away from the mountain, while the other two were sitting able to view the mountains and transmountain road, and one of them noticed this faint light above the mountains, she pointed and asked what it was, it was probably a hundred feet above or so, not sure but it was high up enough to look like a star, because that's what we thought it was. 
 
Thankfully, she didn't believe it was a star - and kept staring at it and suddenly told us it was moving, so we all turned to focus on it, it was so faint we didn't think anything of it for a couple of minutes except it was this hazy purple, it was the exact coloring if you stare at a black light, you can't really focus on it and it had this purple tone to it.  We thought there might be a cloud in front, but it was a clear night, the object was hazy. 
 
So trying to focus on it in the sky, we can begin to see this faint purple/blue light begins to slowly move, side to side, diagonally, in very unusual patterns at different speeds, and then it began to slowly fly behind the mountain, and as we watched it, for about 5 to 10 seconds it went out of sight.  We thought that was all there was to it, but we stayed looking, we all kind of wished it would come back, and we got our wish... 
 
It suddenly came back up and began to float down the mountain but it moves down in different ways, at first it went straight down and then diagonally, just erratic movements and it suddenly gets closer to the cars that are driving on transmountain, so we see this faint purple light get closer and closer to the cars and two of us are really scared that it will crash down, but the other two people with me tried to get out a really bad telescope of mine that didn't work properly - but hoping to be able to use it to see what this object is!  Then it suddenly pauses in front of one of the cars, almost like the object hit the brakes and it lights up so brightly I squinted, and we all just gasped in awe and fear. 
 
Then immediately it shot down below the road into the base of the mountain near an area that has no residential homes, it shot down from the right, then to the left and then out of sight. Being so scared we were expecting to see it come back up into the sky, maybe even fly over us but thankfully nothing.  We called into the non emergency phone line in El Paso to ask if anyone had seen strange lights, and they told us no. 
 
After that, a day later we went up to Transmountain to see if we could see anything below in the desert, and of course we found nothing unusual looking. 
 
I've seen in the mid 90's strange objects in the sky over Ft. Bliss (military base) area which is east of where I lived, objects that would blink and shine light onto the roof of the house in front of ours (without any sound, like a helicopter light should have), but never have I seen this black light colored object, erratically flying around near where a lot of cars drive back and forth 24/7, and if it was anything government made, we wondered why it would be so close to cars, seemed dangerous.  I just wonder if the drivers on Transmountain saw the object, because when it lit up so bright it seemed everyone would have been able to see it!  But it seems nobody noticed it but us that night, and we stayed out for many nights after that hoping to see it again but we haven't yet.",31.782673,-106.3896922

I got a phone call at 3:00am. I ran out to my balcony because my sister told me to look out there and tell her what I saw, at this time I woke my roommate up because I saw a HUGE light just parallel from the radio tower (the one with the red blinking lights) off of Southern Drive.  As morning came closer it was apparent that there was smaller (or farther away…very faint) dots in a circle around it, perfectly spaced apart.  This big one would move up and then back down and because of the tower you could see it moving.  Then it would just sit there for 30-45 minutes, then move a few feet.  You could see flashes of lights coming from this object, like rays shooting out.  All of a sudden further to my right (going towards Buffalo) I saw flashing white and red lights in the sky (looked like lights that would be on top of a police car). It would get brighter and then get dimmer again. When it got bright you could see disk shape to it and at random I could see green lights go in a circular movement around the bottom of it. Then I noticed a bright red/white flashing object directly above my apartment building. The two smaller ones and the big one formed a HUGE triangle in the sky. I sat there and watched this from my balcony for hours.   
 
Around 5:30 am the smaller ones were in the sky together to my right and they looked more orange.  All of a sudden I saw the sky around one light up with a flash. (Like something you would’ve seen on Independence Day) and then it was gone. Seconds later the same things happen to the other one. The whole time the bigger one was moving so slowly back into the sky, but was still brighter than the North Star. As the sun came up and all of the stars disappeared I could still see this object. I watched this object until about 7:10 am when it finally disappeared.",43.99585822,-105.5397577

The sky was completely clear with no moon or clouds.  My wife suddenly exclaimed ""What is that!"" and pointed E-N/E. She continued to point at it and said: ""It went behind the trees.""

 We continued discussing the event postulating what it might be.  Then, 15 minutes later (I checked my watch afterward to verify), I saw something directly overhead and pointed it out to her.

Each object looked roughly square in shape and they were spaced very closely together with even distance.   The formation was completely silent as it went overhead.

It might have been far enough away to be right over the mountains.  I was in my backyard letting the dog out when I saw them.  I thought it was radio towers at first, but I never noticed them before.  They were also flashing much faster than the slow blink of radio towers.  Any given flash was instantly on and off rather than the gradual turning on and off that you would see from radio towers.  The light flashes seemed to be occurring randomly across a rectangular shaped area, about the length of 3 moon widths, and about 3/4 as wide as the moon would be in the sky.

The rectangle of lights was diagonal in the sky, mostly vertical, perhaps about 60 degrees angle, with the highest point of the rectangle on my left (meaning that it more south).

This was news footage from the last 2 minutes of MSNBC's Ed Show from Friday June 29th.  The segment was on the wildfires in Colorado during the last 2 minutes of the show.  The footage shows a helicopter pouring chemicals onto a fire on a hillside in dense smoke, and suddenly from the lower left of the screen, a white light streaks by from the lower left of the screen diagonally to the upper right of the screen, past the helicopter, and out of the lens view.  Initially, it appears to be a single light, but later appears as 2 lights, but it's hard to tell if this is a second object, or just part of the original object. 
 
The film appears to be shot from another helicopter from a considerable distance, and the object appears to be moving too fast to be a bird, and since it is partially obscured by smoke as it emerges, it seems too far away to be a bug or dust. 
 
I do not have access to the footage, but maybe the producers at the Ed Show can steer you in the right direction.  This footage appeared on the last 2 minutes of the June 29th edition of MSNBC's 'Ed Show'.

I got up before 5 am MT on November 9th, 2018 as is usual for me.  When I looked out my window I saw several lights moving slowly down and around the hill in my pasture.  I immediately went outside to get a better look and indeed there were 5-6 separate lights that I assumed to be from UTV’s and/or ATV’s.   Knowing they had to be trailered in as there is no road access, I went back inside to get a coat, boots (there was a light coating of snow) and of course coffee before heading down the hill to see who it was. I was in no hurry knowing they couldn’t get out of there quickly due to the Badlands terrain. 
 
Returning to the shop I took out the truck and I was now visible to them with shop lights on and headlights.  At this point I saw a much larger vehicle I assumed to be a big semi-truck, turn on its lights and it also had several amber “curtesy” lights above the headlights.  My intention was to go down and get a photo of the license plate.  About 30 minutes had passed and they were still out there. 
 
They made no sound, were non-threatening and my dogs did not bark nor were the horses upset. 
 
I then videotaped the lights on my phone which were still moving slowly around my pasture as if they were looking for something.  At the time, I believed they were “shining” for deer or poaching.  Not being able to drive directly down the hill due to the snow cover I went around to the back gate, which took about 2 minutes, to get a picture of the trailer they had to be hauled in on.  It was still dark but there was some moon reflection off the snow.  I found nothing at the back gate.  No truck or trailer, no tracks, nothing, so I went to the neighbors on the opposite side of the hill to see if they were parked up there.  Again, nothing. 
 
I went back home and the lights were gone.  About 45 minutes had passed and it was starting to get light. I drove all around my property, about 10 miles or more, looking for tracks how they got in. Nothing.  No tracks anywhere, at any point, no evidence whatsoever that anyone had been in my landlocked pasture. 
 
The only evidence I have are the photos captured from the video I made. The photos are of machines like nothing I have ever seen; nor any person I have shown them too.  I notified law enforcement and posted it on Facebook.",46.821,-103.1293

At approximately 2000 hrs Aug. 17, the block on which I reside had a power outage due to a blown transformer.

My neighbors were out and witnessed the same formation, and we discussed what ehy could be.

As they flew in a northwesterly direction, several of the shapes changed position in a rapid, darting movement, at sharp angles, before disappearing into the distance.

At about this time, roughly 10 minutes after observing the formation of lights, 3 more lights streaked overhead, in a single file formation, 2 close together and the ""tail end Charlie"" at a greater distance back, moving at an even higher rate of speed to catch up.  They were travelling at speeds much faster than military or civilian aircraft, and made no sound of any kind.

Earlier this evening, around 9:30 pm (just after the sun had set,) a fellow gardener and I were standing in the community gardens of Valley City, ND, and casually talking.  Out of nowhere, a bright, intense object (best I can describe it, would be to say a white light sitting on top of a red light,"" faded into view of the southern sky, and began swooping around, quickly changing elevation and direction.  I say quickly, but the movement was also very fluid.  The object then proceeded to stay stationary for a brief moment, and then made a final swoop (in the shape of a backward letter ""J"") and faded out.  This first sighting lasted approximately 45 seconds. 
 
As we sat there in amazement for a minute talking about what we might have just seen, a different object of the same characteristics appeared in the eastern sky, in the same manner, except remained stationary for approximately 5 minutes...long enough for us to assume it was a star or planet coming into view for the evening.  But, then the object began slowly dancing left to right (in this case north to south.)  The object began ascending into the sky, seemed to hesitate for a brief moment, and then descend below our line of sight. 
 
We sat there again, talking briefly as to what in the world we were just witness to, and then parted ways. 
 
When I arrived home about 5 minutes later, I informed my roommate, and we went for a quick drive to a better vantage point just to take another look.  Before we made it up on the hill, another similar object appeared in the eastern sky.  This object made similar movements as well, including low swoops, changes from left to right (north to south,) until finally soaring into the sky, hesitating yet again, and then descending below our line of sight. 
 
We sped up to get on top of the hill and look around, and saw nothing...until one final similar object appeared in the northern sky.  This object, although appearance was very similar, did not behave as erratically as the other three.  It simply glided along the horizon, heading east, pausing for a few brief moments.  After each pause, when the object proceeded to move again, it would get faster and faster, and finally disappeared out of sight. 
 
Although 3 separate cell phones attempted to capture photographs and videos, the objects we were tracking would not show up.

On the evening of 5 September 2011 my wife and I decided to take a walk on our street.  As we stepped out into the yard we noticed what appeared to be two satellites passing very high in the sky.  The first appeared very bright and travelled away from the direction of the moon as it went it dimmed as it should when it exceeded the reach of the suns light.  The second was flying perpendicular to the first. Rather than travel in the typical straight line it made a minor deviation in it flight path but still continued in the same general direction.  It appeared to first turn right then left again and still maintained its general course.  After discussing the satellites for a moment we started our walk travelling northwest down the street. 
 
We walked and talked about random things and revisited the satellite topic which prompted us to look up frequently. We walked about three blocks down the street and through a lit intersection. Just beyond the intersection the street turned dark again.  It was then that my wife said “Oh my god, check that out.” I followed her finger into the sky and immediately locked onto the object as it flew towards us from the north. It was a triangle of dim white lights with a slight blue hue, six of them arranged in an equilateral triangle. I would estimate its speed between 200-300 mph at an altitude of 500-600 ft. I track the craft as it flew directly over our heads north to south in the direction of the moon. As its path brought it closer to the moon its shape started to become visible. I covered the moon with my hand to continue viewing the craft, as I did the craft began to bank west. When it banked the last light on the left and the center light disappeared with the perspective cha! nge making the craft chevron shaped. 
 
At no time did either of us hear any rotor noise of the sound of a jet craft. The moon light made brought out a solid blocky body surrounding the lights. I am an active duty Army Aviation Soldier with three combat tours and have seen almost every known aircraft including the B-2 spirit. This craft was unlike anything else I have ever seen. Absolutely silent, fast and I would estimate its width to be approx 100 yards based on the profile of a C-5 at roughly the same altitude.

I went out to take a look, then rushed in to grab my Nikkon 35mm film camera and attached the zoom lens on it for a better look.  Unfortunately, I couldn't get the camera to focus on it as it was moving, in order to take a picture.   
 
What it looked like throught the lens was a ball of fire with back ""wings.""  I would say the shape almost resembled a large plane completely engulfed in flames with no back half, only the front through the wings except the wings reached back behind.  Through the lens, there was no mistaking the orange glow and flames.   
 
Considering its size with the naked eye it had to be comparable to a 747, at least.  It continued on northward until it was out of sight.

I arrived home and pulled in the drive around 10:00 like I do every night, I parked in the driveway facing west.  When I looked to my left (south) I seen and unfamiliar light that isn’t normally there, it took me a second to figure out what it might be.  The first thing that came to mind was a plane, but it didn’t feel right because I didn’t see the red and green lights, no strobe at the time, and the “headlights” were an odd gold, orange, yellowish color, I pulled my phone out of my pocket to record what I believed to be an UFO sighting. 
 
In the video, (viewer discretion advised), I tried to explain what I was seeing but it was the most unexplainable thing I’ve ever seen.  When it came closer it moved in a direct straight path, maybe a mile or two over my head.  As it came across the sky it turns a white strobe light on and it seemed like it was trying to mimic a plane and it looked very similar to an F-86 Fighter Jet (Google).  It had curved wings and colorful, yet unexplainable lights that squared across the inside of the wing-span, the object was extremely loud and there were no other planes or helicopters around.  As it flew away it started to look more and more like a plane but the headlights were red. 
 
Later the same night after the incident I witnessed I looked up to the sky to see if I could see anything else, being in awe.  I had seen a white flickering light that appeared to be a star, until my uncle and I see it make some circular motions and seen red flickers (3-5) around the “star”.  Then I had seen another gold, orange, yellowish light without a strobe coming from the south heading north, the lights kind of shifted and it flew away heading east. 
 
What I had seen on 4-29-13 was unexplainable beyond belief, what my story tells may not be believable to some. Seeing is believing, I believe in what I saw.

It is dark and hazy so it is hard to see so I get up and start walking closer and it seems to be a shiny gray or silvery black color and starts to look like a disk.

I was guessing it could be a drone but it seemed much too big to be a drone and just seemed like some sort of craft possibly surveying the area. Another possibility is a cloud but it was much more defined, seemed too small to be a cloud, and there weren't any other low clouds (this thing was probably half the distance off the ground that the low plane was).

I went to let my dogs out at approx 6:10am this morning it was still pretty dark out yet so visibility was pretty good In the night sky with very little if not any cloud cover. 
 
I often look up at the sky this time of year because of the waterfowl usually flying over. I happened to notice a bright white light traveling from west southwest towards the Northeast. I thought nothing of it at first because we typically see allot of satellites traveling over head in the night and early morning. I watched it for  a minute then happened to see another one trailing behind the first one and it appeared to be a few to several miles behind the initial light. I thought that to be strange but not completely out of the ordinary. 
 
Then I saw another and another and another. Then sometimes 2 close together but not connected. Then another and another. It was a constant stream of separate lights all flying in the same direction at presumably the same altitude. It was quiet and very little wind so I could hear that they made no noise and no vapor trail was visible. As we see many commercial jets fly over all the time and they are easy to differentiate. I yelled at my son To come outside to see if he could see what I was seeing and he and I stood and watched no less than 57 separate flying objects passed over in a 20 min period flying on that same heading. Sometimes pretty good distances apart and several flying fairly close together. But we felt the pattern was quite random to be sure. 
 
I am a military vet and I’ve seen allot of different strategic flying formations, from both Navy and Air Force and I felt this was just to weird to ignore.

On October 23, 2021, roughly at 3:30am  I was in my kitchen making a drink and I glanced across my living room and looked out my window and noticed a really bright light in the sky above an apartment complex 600 yards away, maybe a little more across a six lane highway.  I go outside to investigate expecting it to be a helicopter but it's moving side to side repetitively i would guess 100 feet back and forth, so i proceed to the end of my street towards the highway and first thing i notice is no sound from a helicopter.  And at that take phone out to record this and my phone wouldn't function at all and its never had this issue, but i observed this light for about five or so minutes then suddenly it stop moving side to side and moves across highway above me towards my house and just vanished so with the hair standing up all over i hurry home and just tried not to think about it then went to sleep. 
 
11am later that morning i wake up well rested not even thinking about what i saw earlier in the night, just laying in bed watching tv for about thirty minutes and all of a sudden i get extremely sluggish and drowsy like i been drugged and something was going threw my mind like i was talking to someone briefly don't know exactly what it was about all i can remember is agreeing to and involuntarily nodding my head to not to say anything than i black out for a short moment come too and shockingly i'm having a violent seizure and i feel my arms being restrained.  I black out again for just a moment then my eyes open suddenly. I'm laying on my side and I was on my back originally but I can't move.  Then I see an individual walk right past me and go out my door.  I'm guessing around a low 5 feet tall skinny build, with pale complexion black eyes probably twice the size of standard eyes, the individual had a big forehead with a crevice down the center of it in a black tight fitting ou! tfit. 
 
Then i glance into my mirror and freak out.  There is only one way I can explain what I saw.  This resembles on the movie Men In Black the coffee drinking and cigarette smoking aliens stick figure shape but with short tentacles 4inch roughly in length going all down its midsection What ever this was on the other side of me flipping out all over the place. Then i feel someone moving my bed and something inserted in my left ear and hear a soft voice say ""daw"" then i able to move my head slightly and i try to speak but black out again i wake up roughly two hours later and i had to run to the bathroom i was sick felt better afterwards went in my room looked around everywhere couldn't find any traces of anybody or thing anywhere but i know what i saw and felt  it wasn't a dream i was very much aware when i came too for the short while So thats what happened i wanted to report it with it still fresh on my mind take it how you will i thought somebody might benefit from my experience",32.9009297,-96.63741912

i went out at 1840 pm to have a smoke and noticed a big bright light in the southwest sky.  I first thought it was a aircraft of sometime but it wasnt moving. i watched it for 7-10 minutes and it was stationary in the sky.  This light was huge compared to stars and other lights in the sky. I put my little finger on my right hand over the light to try and gauge its size.  The lights size was that about halve the size of a pencil eraser.  It was very bright and to be honest the closest thing I could compare it too and i know this sound hokey but it's shape reminded me of ""the star of Bethlehem""...just a big bright light with a four point star look.  I came inside house to grab camcorder and it's battery was dead so i started charging my camera.  I then went to google and googled astronomy events and all i could find was that Jupiter was near waning crescent moon at 1am this morning.  I could find nothing about what I was seeing.  I went back out and watched some more and it was just a big stationary light. At no time did i think this was a Helicopter as I see those all the time with there spot lights on.  Since it was dark I couldnt tell if this was a celestial or terrestrial light...i believe it was celestial.  I came back outside at 1950 and the light is completely gone!! it is just gone...we do have some clouds but I can still see the stars that are much dimmer than this light in the southwest sky.

At times they appear to turn to and fro.  There are many of them in our sky and some appear to form a large circle with much space between them like a dot to dot color book.

After leaving Des Moines, Iowa on I35 south I noticed 2 bright lights to the east.  It looked like bright car lights but didn't look like they were moving. 
 
I then thought it was a tower with lights on it.   
 
It then was moving towards us.  It was about 1/4 mile away and about the height of the red beacon towers for planes. Me, my wife and 4 kids were watching this.  Then about 50-100 yards before reaching I35 it turned north and we could see the bottom.  It was a perfect triangle shape with lights at the points that were not blinking and 3 lights in about halfway from the flat sides to the middle that were flashing.  It turned from flat to its side pretty fast but at a slow speed. It then was out of my view but the kids watched it until it was gone.  
 
Last seen heading north towards Des Moines.

I was fishing, sitting back in my chair, changing the song on my iPhone when suddenly a brilliant blueish/white explosion of light illuminated the entire area. 
 
I look up just quick enough to catch a glance of what is very hard to describe with certainty because it happened so fast, but what I can say for fact is that whatever caused this flash was very close to me; about 20 yards in front of me and about 50 yards above the water. Literally almost over head. 
 
What I recall once I looked at the source was a blueish/white light with a bit of a tail, sort of like a spade, but the tail wasn't as acute. Also, the spade of light was slightly split in the middle by a blue streak. This light source/spade was about 20 yards wide and 30 yards long. 
 
 I imagine this phenomenon was a craft exploding into acceleration and what I saw was the propulsion like that from a modern rocket ship. Except this was light not fire. 
 
And it made no noise at all, that's the most unbelievable part to me, being as close as I was. 
 
 I don't believe I was abducted because there was no loss of time or bodily marks and such. Not even feelings of fear or unease. 
 
Although this was my first of three verified sightings/encounters in a month. This flash, & 2 separate orange circle/orb sightings that can be nothing other than extra terrestrial.

Noticed a ""star"" or a ""plane"" that seemed unusually bright and twinkling (was actually more of a flashing at times). Thought this was odd, looked at few other stars in the sky, they were all significantly less bright and unremarkably twinkly.  This woke me up more and and i watched the object in question for 20-30 more minutes hoping it would go back to looking like the rest of the stars or start moving like a plane or a satellite.  No change in the objects location occurred during this time but the light grew much stronger and seemed to sparkle like brilliant white light from far away refracting through a crystal.  Thought i saw distinction between blue and red light so i continued to watch the object hoping, again, it would display behavior like an airplane or something familiar.  At one point the light became so brilliant i was positive this was not like any star i have ever seen.  The twinkling/flickering seemed to fluctuate at a constant  rate, like something mechanical. To give you an idea, if the brightest stars and lights from nearby jets in the sky amounted to a pea, this object's light at its brightest moment would comparable be that of an apple. Light faded and is now gone from the spot in the sky, even when no visible cloud cover is overhead.

03/29/19 Just after midnight (12:15 am 03/29/19) pretty clear night, lights were below the clouds if there were any. 
 
I shut off the TV, the room was dark and I looked out the south facing window of our Lakeville, MN, home as I often do to reflect before bed time.  We face a large field about a half mile across with new housing development on the other side.  There is a very large new apartment building straight across from us.  I saw a small bright light in the distant sky above the apartment building to our south.  This is common because we live on a  flight path to MPLS Airport. 
 
I watched for a couple minutes and the light seemed to be still so I decided it was a star but it was too low and bright to be a star.  I watched a few more minutes then stood up to leave the room.  I noticed it had moved a little.  I thought I want to see what this slow bright airplane is.  Usually the lights go from just visible to an obvious airplane with landing lights and sound over our house in less then five minutes. 
 
A few more minutes (probably 2 or 3) passed and the light was noticeably closer.  I saw pulsating or revolving red lights at the top of a sort of triangle.  The red lights seemed to revolve but the bright lights seemed to radiate down the triangle from the red lights.  It was coming straight at me from the south so I decided to wait and see what this was. 
 
It approached closer and angled off to the east toward Saint Paul.  The image stopped getting bigger but I could see it pretty clearly.  The red lights appeared more stationery but flashing.  The bright lights seemed to be traveling down at an angle like they were following a rope from the top of a sail on a sailboat.  The lights came down both sides from the top in a tag along format.  Both sides didn't appear to be synchronized but both were the same.  The light seemed to travel back and forth between the bottom corners, not as bright as the others and more random.  There was very little, if any noise, from it but I felt I did detect a slight distant jet engine sound. 
 
It moved further away to the north east until it was back to being a strange bright slow moving light in the sky.  I went to bed.  I told my wife about it this morning.  She found this web site and encouraged me to send in my report.",44.6707,-93.2588

It was about 9:15 or 9:30 on a clear, summer evening in 2013, in the middle of Missouri, along Highway 50.  I had just clocked-out at work and was taking out the trash when my cellphone rang.  It was a friend of mine, calling from his girlfriend’s house, about three blocks to the northwest of my location. 
 
I answered and he asked if I had a clear view of the sky; I didn’t.  Where I was was mostly surrounded with trees and buildings, but he was on the edge of town, with an open field behind the house.  He told me to go west of town and look up, because he was “looking at the mothership or something.”  So I got in my car and drove about a mile west to the edge of town.  The sun had just gone down so the sky was still orange in the West, fading to dark blue in the East with a few stars starting to appear.  I stopped the car and stepped out. 
 
Looking up, I saw a massive black triangle against the sky, almost directly overhead, but slightly to the north of me.  At arm’s length, it was about two feet long and one foot wide. It was pointing West by Southwest, and slowly cruising in that direction.  It was an acute isosceles shape (but slightly skewed from my perspective), solid black, with no lights and no sound. 
 
(I feel that I should mention here, that although I feel my above description to be true, part of me thinks there may have been a dark-red, circular light at each corner of the craft, although I concede this may be a corrupted memory after looking at numerous pictures of these craft types on the Internet.)  Over the course of about a minute, I watched it cruise away and the farther away it got, the slimmer and slimmer it became until it finally vanished from view.

The object appeared to be hovering in one spot but once in a while would get kind of shifty, as if as if it were banking hard side to side, and when it would do this it would expose the bottom of what we believed to be either a disc shape or a mushroom shaped craft, either way the bottom was lit up yellowish, about the color of like a street light.  Around the craft there was a very faint green glow to it.  The craft hovered for about 30 mins. or so and slowly moved away from us.

But i didnt move for about 20 min so we thought it was just a star.  
 
We went on with our business. 20min later when i look up in the sky that blinking light was moving right across the sky.

As I was taking a picture, I noticed a yellow circular shape moving through the trees.  I was taking a panoramic picture as it was moving and then it abruptly stopped, seemingly  to hover in the trees.   
 
I continued to take the panoramic picture, and as I was getting ready to stop the photo, I saw through my screen display, the object shoot through the trees, and then shooting into the sky.  I photographed the circular object hovering in the trees, as well as it entering the clouds in one panoramic photo. z object did not leave any type of vapor trail that I could see, it moved so fast that I was able to catch it in one short panoramic photo.  Both as it hovered, as well as it in the clouds.  
 
The object had tree branches in front of it, and it blocked seeing tree branches behind it.  Also, the object is also seen with part of the cloud in front of it, and it's blotting out the dark clouds behind it. 
 
I cannot really determine the size of the object, may be six to eight feet in diameter.  It was  A bright yellow or white in color, it seemed like it was flashing.  I tried to duplicate the same picture, but there were no objects in following pictures taken.  This helped me conclude that this was not a dirty lens on my camera or a raindrop.

This is a report of a UFO I witnessed within the last two hours.  I will begin with the time and local weather, then give the description. 
 
It is May 26, 2014.  Local time at the end of the event was 1:08 a.m., Central Daylight time.  It is Memorial Day weekend.  The location is a residential area in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. 
 
GPS position is 41° 59.461 N x 91° 41.162 W. 
 
People in the neighborhood had been outside earlier, but had all gone inside.  The night was quiet. 
 
Local weather reports indicate partly cloudy, with clouds at 6,000 to 10,000 feet, temperature 68 to 70°, wind speeds 1 to 4 MPH. 
 
My backyard view is limited by hillside and trees.  I could not feel any breeze or see any stars.   
 
I saw a  red-orange light in the northwest, moving relatively slowly to its northeast.  It seemed to curve to a more northerly direction.  It looked about as low as a typical small airplane or helicopter, but there was no sound. 
 
I could not discern any features such as corners that would indicate shape, but it seemed to have perhaps 5 or 10% of the Moon's apparent diameter.  The intensity was steady.  It looked nearer and brighter than an overflying aircraft light, and the color was less intense red, with an orange hue.   
 
I watched for maybe a minute or two and it grew dimmer as it moved away, then I lost sight of it. 
 
An hour and twenty minutes later there was a brief heavy rain shower.

Three buddies and I were riding on a UTV at 11 at night. I stopped and shut off the engine in the middle of a field to take in the night. I saw what looked like a satellite to the West and it was heading North. It traveled a small distance like a meteor, but slower, like a satellite. It disappeared like an Iridium Flare, but reappeared at a different elevation relative to the horizon. It traveled again like it had before, then disappeared again. The third, fourth, and fifth times it appeared it was going in different directions. First West, then Northeast, then down toward the horizon. I've never fully believed in ETs until that night. A few minutes after it quit, there were three aircraft with normal aircraft flashing lights headed east that were in a triangle shape, but with huge gaps in between them. These appeared to come from nowhere. 
 
Then the next night, 24 hours later at approximately 12:12 AM, I was driving home headed west when a bright light appeared from above for about a second and a half, not moving, then disappeared. 
 
 Both of these occurrences triggered a driveway chime in our house, that uses infrared to notify people coming through our driveway. My girlfriend was in the house at both times and said that was the exact time it went off. It would go off approximately at 11:39, 12:12, 12:39, and 1:08 sporadically. That week was the most active that it went off, and it slowly stopped ringing and now the driveway chime hasn't gone off for 2 weeks in the middle of the night. 
 
 The only other logical explanation I've been able to come up with is a high maneuverability aircraft that the government could be testing, and the lights we saw were the afterburners on the aircraft. However, I've never heard of an aircraft that can turn almost on a dime going what appeared to be several hundred miles per hour (300-400+), though it was difficult to tell at what distance it was.",42.6884,-90.7002

I was locking up my garage facing NW when I saw two very bright white lights in the sky heading SE.  The lights were approx 500-1,000 feet above the ground.  This guess is based on my own personal experiences with flight lessons in which I was a pilot who flew under VFR only. 
 
What made me watch the lights was the fact that there were no navigational blinking lights as well as literally NO SOUND.  The craft flew over my house and it was at this time that I noticed it was not two but three white lights in a triangular shape. 
 
I wanted to run in and get my wife but did not want to miss out on what I was seeing.  This craft was very low and while directly overhead emitted a sort of haze around the lights.  I really believe that this object was not a conventional aircraft despite it heading in the direction of the Moline, IL airport. 
 
There has to be other people in the vicinity to have seen this.  I am shocked at what I saw at such a close distance.  I would not normally go out of my way to report something like this but this was very unique experience.

On 06/15/17, at 9:05 pm, standing on our deck preparing to barbeque, I saw a light in southeastern sky that was moving toward my position gradually.  I noticed that it looked different from an aircraft (we live south of St. Louis airport so airplanes are common and frequent) and had an orange/red glow much like a flame so my first guess was that it could be a hot air balloon.   
 
As it got closer, I tried to listen for the familiar sound of gas burners but was surprised at its total silence.  It soon lost the light and moved to more of a north course as a very dim sphere.  It seemed to speed up and soon was beyond the trees on our horizon to the north.   
 
The entire siting lasted approximately 10 minutes.   
 
Upon reflection, I don’t recall ever seeing a hot air balloon past sunset and never saw one move so fast.   
 
Also, I could not discern a fast wind to propel a balloon.

On Saturday night, July 14, 2012, my wife and I were driving west on West Esplanade Ave. in Kenner, Louisiana and turned north northwest onto Driftwood Blvd.  Straight ahead were red lights in the sky in formation.  We turned left onto Emile Ave. and could not see the lights.  We turned right onto Osborne Ave. but the lights were hidden by trees.  I told my wife about them and we drove down Osborne and could see them to the north when we passed by houses without trees.  We turned right (due north) on Gelpi Ave. and could see five red lights in the sky in a roughly triangular formation.  They did not appear to be moving.  They seemed to be suspended and motionless in the sky. They were relatively high in the sky.  From our vantage point, I would estimate that they were between 30° to 45° up into the sky. We assumed that they were over Lake Pontchartrain.  As we continued driving north trying to find an unobscured viewing area, the lights suddenly faded and di! sappeared.  Disappointed, we turned around and headed home.  At this point, I looked at the clock on my dashboard and mentally noted that it was at exactly 10:00 PM CDT.  What was unusual about these lights is that they were above the normal flight path of planes landing or taking off from New Orleans International Airport.  We see jet lights all the time.  These were not jet lights.  I don’t know what they were.

‘Fireball’ in sky over Alton creates buzz  ALTON — Did little green men take a cruise in their spaceship over Alton?  Probably not — but something strange in the sky caught the attention of several Telegraph readers Thursday evening. 
 
According to Robert Lunsford of the American Meteor Society (AMS), reports of a fireball came from across the state Thursday evening. 
 
“The sightings were clustered right around Chicago,” Lunsford said. “We’ve only received a couple from the St. Louis area.  We have 34 total sightings. St. Louis seems to be on the southwestern edge of our reports.  It was apparently seen as far away as Ann Arbor, Michigan.”   Lunsford added that similar sightings came from Texas and Louisiana around 2 a.m. Friday.  He said the southern fireball had about half as many reports as the one over Illinois. Such bright fireballs are common in February, March and April, he added. 
 
“This is the peak time for evening fireballs,” he said. “I have no doubt that it was a meteor.”   Lunsford said most of the reports claimed to have seen a large green fireball, but some were blue or yellow.  According to Lunsford, the seemingly strange colors are actually quite common when a large chunk of space debris enters Earth’s atmosphere. 
 
“Entering the atmosphere excites the oxygen molecules and creates a sort of greenish glow,” he said. 
 
The AMS is still investigating the case, which includes looking for evidence that the meteor metamorphosed into a meteorite by hitting the surface of Earth. 
 
“There’s still a possibility that it did,” Lunsford said.  “We look for signs of sonic booms that indicate that the object entered the lower atmosphere.  We haven’t had any of those so far.”   Social media in the Riverbend was abuzz with chatter about the fireball — or whatever it was — late Thursday and early Friday.  Facebook user Jason Cox wrote on the Telegraph’s wall that he saw the object around 8:30 p.m. Thursday evening while traveling north on Homer Adams Parkway off Broadway. 
 
Another user, Berthal Allsman said he saw a similar object on Homer Adams Parkway and described it as “kool as h—-.”   Mandi Carroll wrote that she saw it while driving on Missouri Route 367 towards Alton. 
 
Most Facebook users that claimed to have seen the object on the Telegraph’s page described it as a meteor.  Others jokingly theorized that it was a spaceship, a methamphetamine lab explosion or popular Star Trek character Spock, portrayed by the recently deceased Leonard Nimoy, reaching his destination on the final frontier. 
 
The Alton Police Department said that they did not receive any calls on the matter. Alton Police spokesperson Emily Hejna speculated that it was most likely not a visiting life form from the far reaches of the cosmos. 
 
The Telegraph also reached out to NASA regarding the matter, but nobody from the administration had responded to the request as of press time.  An official did confirm they were investigating the reports, however.  The official echoed the belief that it was probably not a spaceship.",38.9093,-90.16

But one light, which appeared to be a star was moving across the sky slowly, but fast enough to recognize it was indeed moving.  I stared at it, looked around, walked onto the street to get a better view, and looked up again.  It was still hovering, at a fairly consistent speed headed southeast from my vantage point.

I was out jogging through the south side of Stevens Point, and as I ran from south to north on side streets, I saw a bright orange light coming up over the tree tops and buildings ahead of me.  There is a municipal airport on the north side of the city, so low-flying small aircraft are a very common sight.  If the light had been white, I wouldn't have given it a second look, assuming that it was just a small plane that had taken off from the airfield. 
 
Although its color seemed unusual, it behaved like other low-flying aircraft I've seen at night, proceeding in a steady, straight line, moving north to south, right over the neighborhood I was passing through.  I stopped running and watched it, expecting to see wing lights blinking, that the orange light was just so much brighter that it obscured them.  Although the orange light seemed to very slightly pulse a few times, there were no other colored lights, nothing blinking. 
 
I watched it silently pass overhead, turning myself around to face south, until it was obscured by nearby trees.  The entire 'sighting"" lasted approximately one minute.  I continued on my run. 
 
Less than 5 minutes later, as I still ran north, I saw another bright orange light, again coming from the north and moving south!  I stopped immediately to watch it, and it looked and behaved almost exactly as the first one I'd seen.  It also seemed as though it could've been a low-flying, single-engine airplane with orange headlights on.  It seemed to follow the exact same path as the first light, and also made no sound whatsoever. 
 
The only difference this time was that, when it was directly overhead, the strength of the light started fading.  It dimmed very rapidly as it continued to move until I could no longer see it.  It reminded me of watching a satellite passing overhead on a clear night, as it moves in a perfectly straight line, and then slowly gets dimmer and dimmer until it is no longer visible.  Maybe the first light also did this, but I could not see it because of the trees. 
 
It was a beautiful chilly night, with little to no breeze, and a crystal clear, cloudless sky full of stars: a perfect night for a run, and it turned out to be a very memorable run!",44.5235988,-89.55720135

I was about 3 or 4 miles west of the sth 12/14 interchange in Middleton, WI, when I noticed a red flashing orb at about the 5 o’clock position.  The orb caught my eye because my first thought was when did they put up a new TV tower and gosh it must be tall.   
 
After a few seconds I realized it was moving rather quickly, and obviously not stationary.  Due to the color it was emitting, I noted it couldn’t be an airplane, as the size of the object would be way to large to be an aircraft’s strobe lights and there was no green or white light either.  I would guess it was also traveling 2 or 3 times faster than your standard jet based on how quickly it was moving away from me.   
 
Then when it was starting to near the end of my visible horizon it took a hard left heading northerly with a slight downward trajectory while also to remarkably double its original speed and quickly went out of view.   
 
I would like to stress this light was definitely not a reflection from within the cab of my vehicle nor a light somehow reflecting off my windshield.   
 
I would estimate this light was originally flying several thousand feet off the ground, maybe 2 or 3 in my best estimation before making its turn and descent.   
 
The light it emitted was rather unusual, as it appeared to have a slightly foggy characteristic about it.

Being that I live on the gulf coast ,USA near many military bases, NASA research centers and airports I paid no mind. However, as I continued upon my route the object I noticed it was moving in atypical aviation patterns. I am closely familiar with aviation capabilities (known) and come from a line of pilots and military personnel. This was different from anything I had ever seen. It seemed to change altitude effortlessly with no    Trail or heat byproduct behind it. I observed it flying at an FL of  7-10 feet.. It appeared bright white throughout and had a longer body than width an almost looked like cigar with more rounded edges. I did manage to take a short video and 2 photos. The stability of the video is shaky from driving but clear.  The reason I did not think it to be a known aircraft was its ability to change direction laterally with! ease.

I am a 44 year old female. I have attended several years of college, but received no degree. I receive SSDI and do part-time care for an elderly shut-in woman.  This is my report of something I witnessed from the back door of my home. 
 
It was the middle of July, 2011.  I had been quite sad and frustrated and was home alone crying.  It was a nice night so I had the back door of my trailer open for fresh air. The door faces west and I have a wide viewing of the night sky there.  I also live a ways out of town so there isn’t much light interference. It was between 1 and 1:15 a.m. when I got up and stood in the doorway, leaning against the door jam.  My cat came outside and sat on the porch. I cried and started staring at the stars. It struck me that they didn’t look quite right, but was very self-oriented and didn’t think twice of it.  After about 10 minutes, I had stopped crying and was again staring at the stars.  A weird movement to the left of my peripheral vision caught my attention.  I couldn’t see anything, so again I dismissed it and thought that my eyes were just blurry from having cried. 
 
I went to get a cigarette about 1:45 then went back to the door jam and watched the stars again.  That’s when I saw a strange sort of wave in the sky almost due west. It was like seeing 2 or 3 quick water ripples.  I thought I was seeing things so I looked closer at that area of the sky.  I know the basic pattern of the stars I can usually see and the ones I did see didn’t look right.  They were in more of a grid pattern, all seemed to be the same brightness, and they didn’t seem to twinkle.  I suddenly had an overpowering, anxious, panicky feeling that I was being watched.  I looked around at the neighbors trailers, but there wasn’t anyone outside or in any window that faced me.  I then felt a strange electric sensation that made the hair on my arms and scalp stand on end and my fingertips tingle.  My cat got up and quickly ran in the house. 
 
I looked up again and was watching this grid pattern. It was if I was transfixed.  I couldn’t look away and I felt as if I was in slow motion.  I don’t know how long I stared. Then, I can’t say that there was a definite shape to the area, but the stars I was looking at started to shift like they were all slowly moving in unison.  It wasn’t a big shift, but it definitely was between 15 and 20 degrees.  It took 20 to 30 seconds to complete the rotation.  When they stopped, my field of view of the sky seemed to look closer to the normal constellations I see and the grid pattern was less pronounced. I stepped out onto the porch to see more sky and tried to see if the area had a shape I could see. I couldn’t find any edges or darker, shadowed lines. Again, I felt the electric sensation and the tingling. I remember looking down and blinking several times and shaking off the sensations. When I looked up again, the stars looked normal and I could also see the lights of an east bound ! jetliner high in the sky. I remember having the distinctly clear thought “Go inside. Shut the door. Sit and watch some TV. No one will believe you.” It was like someone had told me this because I heard it in my mind. I blankly did such. 
 
It was going on 4 when I realized that I had been sitting on the end of the bed staring at the TV instead of in the middle where I usually sat. It wasn’t until then that I even thought of the strange things I had seen. Initially, I thought the unusual ""stars"" were more along the lines of government “Star Wars” satellites.  That would explain why they were all the same brightness and in a grid.  I recalled that when I had first gone to the door, there was the noise of frogs and crickets, but after feeling like I was watched, I don’t remember hearing anything.  I never heard a sound like an engine or felt any extra air motion aside from the gentle breeze that had been blowing.  I thought that I had just been lucky enough to see the distant satellites change formation in order to do whatever “spying” or weapon exercises they did.  It wasn’t until March of 2014 that I heard of “star-field cloaking” that some UFO’s have been reported as using.  Now, I question if it wasn’t something like that that I witnessed.",42.70178092,-89.04138836

Tonight's skies were clear at the time of our ""sighting"", and my daughter and I were observing the moon with a spotting scope while waiting for Jupiter to rise above the trees east of our lot.  There was regular commuter air traffic at high altitude from west to east, just south of our position.  Lower in the sky to our south, but slightly west of our position, we observed a ball of orange light moving in the sky that was peculiar in several respects: first, unlike an aircraft, it exhibited no strobe or other marker lights.  Second, in its undeviating travel, it was moving due north; as it passed us, it made absolutely no sound--we had been able to hear the faint whine of jet engines at an apparently much higher altitude, but this object made no sound at all.  I was hoping to hear something-the buzz of a propeller that would explain what we were observing-any sound at all, but there was none.  Finally, the apparent size, shape and luminous output of the obje! ct remained constant as it crossed the sky from horizon to horizon. 
 
The object appeared to be traveling at approximately the same altitude as many small aircraft we've observed over the years at our location: approximately 4,000 to 5,000 feet MSL.  This object appeared to be moving more quickly than most aircraft in our area, completely transiting the sky in about a minute. 
 
The object appeared to be an orange sphere (deep orange-red at the perimeter, a similar color to an NBA basketball at the center, where the glow was brightest).  Its luminosity was similar to an aircraft landing headlight, but this glow did not change during the entirety of its transit, neither to diminish nor to increase as it passed.  This indicates one of two things: a luminous sphere (which is what it appeared to be); or an orange-colored landing light aimed directly at us during the due-north travel of the object (obviously improbable). 
 
The object appeared to be similar in size to the cabin of a small aircraft, such as a Cessna 182, though the transit appeared to be faster than a typical propeller-driven aircraft; .  The object appeared to pass within a half mile or so to our west at the indicated altitude, at about 30 degrees declination from zenith.  Again, per GPS it was moving due north (not magnetic).",42.5881,-88.4554

Then it just turned off. It was just a cornfield. After the bend on County Rd U it was in a cornfield off to my left. I was traveling E on U after the bend before or right close to Eastside rd.

I was in my backyard which is on the north side of my property.  I observed what at first I believed to be fireworks ascending from the west.  I observed a reddish glow with what appeared to be a yellowish fireball in the center.  Being Christmas I assumed that one of the neighbors had lit a firework, as they do on holidays. 
 
This light continued to ascend and moved in an easterly path almost directly over my backyard.  It maintained an elevation of approx. 150 feet and continued in an almost due east direction.  The speed of this object was slow, guessing about 10 to 15 miles per hour.  I observed this object as it went further away from me until it appeared to fade into the low cloud cover about 1 to 2 miles east of my location. 
 
The shape of this object seemed to be fluctuating a bit, but mainly appeared to be of a cylinder shape.  The description I gave to the local police was that it kind of looked like a red jellyfish with a cluster of 2 or 3 fireballs in the center of it floating across the sky. At one point as this object wavered there appeared to be lines extending from the top of the cylinder down the sides in a uniform manner.  Similar to the tentacles of jellyfish.  However there was a defined bottom to the lines almost like a veil. It almost appeared that the red aura was from the illumination of the center fireball cluster. 
 
I'm not sure of the size of this object, but I roughly guess that the top to bottom length was about 5 feet and that the diameter was about 3 feet.   
 
Oddly, there was no sound detectable by me.

At approximately 9:40 p.m. on the northside of Kaukauna, WI, (in the country), as I was going outside to leave my parent’s home, I  saw what appeared initially to be a formation of fireballs slowly moving through the sky.  I describe them as fireballs because they were orange in color and appeared to be glowing.  They were also soundless.   
 
They were much larger than the stars and planets in the sky; if I had to estimate I would say they were the size of 10 stars together.   
 
There were two of these objects in the lead side by side and another 5–6 that followed.   
 
My mother and I first saw these objects in the east and they were traveling upward and northwest.  They appeared to be flying at the height of a low flying airplane.   
 
After approximately 1-2 minutes of seeing them, they faded out, once they got to the same point in the sky, except for one near the middle of the formation, which lasted about 40 seconds longer.   
 
The whole experience of seeing these flying objects lasted approximately 4-5 minutes.

I was walking my dog in a park at night with a clear sky. I saw a faint vertical streak on the horizon and thought it might have been the remnants of a comet streak. As I continued to look, it got brighter, closer, and began to rotate to orient horizontally in relation to the horizon. Once it was directly above me, I noticed it was a line of star-like lights, each about as bright as an average star. Some were spaced in twos or threes. I thought it could have been a comet streak but once it was horizontal across the sky I saw individual lights following a straight line pattern. The lights moved too fast to be satellites or planes but too slow to be meteors or comets. It seemed to be higher than the normal flight altitude of planes. There was a point in the sky that once the lights hit it, they fizzled out and disappeared. One by one they hit this point and until they were all gone. I also noticed that once the last light disappeared, the frogs around me start! ed singing again and I had been watching the event in dead silence. My sister was at a bonfire about two miles away and got a video of the line of lights. I truly have never seen something like this in my life.

I was walking down the sidewalk with a four of my friends at about 2am after leaving a bar when one noticed a bright orange light traveling across the sky.  It appeared to be flying low and was extremely fast.   
 
This was in Chicago at Clark and Winnemac while we were walking north on clark street.  It was very bright orange, and larger than anything I've seen before.  We knew immediately it wasn't a plane because we could see two other planes flying in the sky and they were much higher and farther away in the sky.  The planes were a different color- more yellowish/whitish and were moving much slower relative to the orange light.   
 
We stared at it trying to determine if it was a helicopter or plane, but it didn't look like anything any of us had seen before. It was literally a round very bright orange light moving forward very fast.  One of my friends even described it as looking like a planet moving fast across the sky.   
 
We were watching for about 45 seconds as it moved very rapidly across the sky in a straight line then the orange light dimmed, and completely disappeared.   
 
We watched for 5 minutes after the disappearance but it didn't become visible again.    
 
All we could see were the two planes that continued to fly.   
 
We were all pretty confused as to its disappearance because none of us have ever seen a plane that disappeared while flying across the sky.",41.88082155,-87.66846953

I am an Amateur Radio Extra Operator.   
 
On the evening of September 22, 2012 @ 0755 central time, I stepped out of my ham shack for a little break.  The door to my ham shack is facing east.  It was dark outside and the moon was low in the South West at the time.    
 
I noticed a reddish, orange glow in the sky above my garage.  The glow was located about 50 degrees off of the horizon in the northeast direction which is about 15 degrees north from my ham shack.  This glow seemed to be moving in a south east direction.  When I first noticed the glow, it was fairly large and when it disappeared it was about ¼ its original size.  
 
I watched it move across the sky for about 3 to 5 minutes before it seem to completely disappear. About a minute before it disappeared, I ran to my house and alerted my wife who also witnessed it for about one minute before it disappeared.  When it disappeared it wasn’t due to it going over the horizon, it was like a switch was turned off and it disappeared about 30 degrees over the southeast horizon.   
 
The glow seemed to have a small tail on it and it appeared to be glowing.  This tail was more dominate while the glow was in the northeast sky than it was in the south east sky; it reminded me of a Chinese lantern.  I could not tell how high it was due to lack of clouds or anything else to gauge its distance from. I do remember that there was no sound at all from the glow.   
 
The glow seemed to moving in a straight line, there was no noticeable maneuvering from the glow.   
 
I was raised on various USAF bases around the world for 18 years, and then served 16 years in the US Navy.  I have seen lots of aircraft in the sky at night but this type of glow I have never seen before.

Started Noticing, About 4-Years-Ago, many odd & ghastly Triangle-Formations that appear to be laid-out in/over Carpets & Walls. At first I didn't think much about it, but, sometimes orbs & ghastly-extraterrestrials come out of them & sometimes they Light-Up & move, & the Dog started behaving weird, looking at the floor like a pup looks at a toy-car, ears going from one side to the other, & I seen a Ghastly-Extraterrestrial Appear, Sticking Its Head Out of a Small-Odd-Triangle-Shape In-the-Floor, &, It said something mean to my dog, got my dog growling at it, & the dog started biting at it, & it laughed at the dog & disappeared, but not the Triangle. I got Attacked-by the Extraterrestrials, & then started talking to them. I can hear them & communicate with them. They are talkative, & I have learned a lot of cool new stuff now from Interviewing Them & The Space-System. I did an Investigation & Found-Out This-Information: The Extraterrestrials are Not From This Space-Environment, They were Sent-By Their Corrupt-Creator, Czar. They are Immortal*, & I Figured-Out how. Also learned where Hitler came-from, why there were Extraterrestrials in the World-Wars & Vietnam, what happened to Hitler, why he is crazy. It's this Czar Character, It Attacked Our Space-Environment & destroyed Spacial-Real-Estate & many Planet-Surfaces & Is Trying to Destroy Us. I Figured-Out How-To Utilize This Space-System-Over-Ride-Thing to Catch/Soul-Process The Extraterrestrial-Czar from Where he Dies & Can Prove It. The Over-Ride has him pissed, he lost ability to Process-his-Soul, & Lost Ability to Portal & Got Stuck, Is Stuck in a Cock-Pit in something called an ExtraExhistiential-Space-Ocean. This Czar Character made a Mistake: he sent the Extraterrestrials here, told them to attack, kill & enslave us, but didn't mean to pay, & they overheard him talking about killing them & destroying this Space-Environment when he was done. They Turned Against him & chose 'The-Quantum-God-Space-System' & he Opposes This Space-System. He got in-trouble with the Space-System & Got Stuck. He thought he was gonna win a fight with me & has lost. The Space-System is Who's Responsible for all the Telepathy & Saying-to-Apply-Settings-Stuff & Odd-New-Space-Environment-Workings. If You are Good At Your Job, you know something is attacking us from Space, it is because I caught this Extraterrestrial. I Found-Out How-To Do Everything. I have all the Instructions for How-To-Access & Utilize The-Space-System & Get Space-Environment-Access-Maps & How-To-Create-&-Hack-Open Ships-&-Portals & How Space Works & How to Materialize/Manifest Stuff. I Found-Out the Extraterrestrials are everywhere*, because of how Czar created & sent them here, we are Outnumbered, but I currently have most of them Stuck onboard the Ships They Are On, & they don't mean to fight anymore, but do want help, are willing to forfeit ships for Study & Research. They don't know it yet, but they are full of potential, & i know it*. They have Lazor-Guns & Plasma-Shooters. I have Notes on the Interviews. They've attacked many people. They Soul-Project. I know how to get on & off-board their Ships, but, i don't think they're into getting hurt. I Figured-Out How-To Portal-To Czar, Their-Creator, To Kill him. We do that & gain control of the Situation again, gain control of the attacking ships in our orbit & around us, gain better info. I have photographed & video-recorded some more recent evidence. The Guy who's house this has been happening in is Dangerous, is under control by Czar alot without knowing, & absolutely won't talk about it. He's a bit mean, I could use some help with this. I believe The-Extraterrestrials are Ready to Come-Out In-Public, but are Scared, &, yeah, they do have bodies, & I got them to chill out a bit on the possessing-people. Can somebody please come help me with the Extraterrestrial-Invasion i am dealing with? It is what has been causing the Time-Restart-Problem. I found out exactly how that works Too. In one of the pics you see an extension-cord-end with a Ghost sitting on Top & a Small Red Ghastly-Ship Flying next to it. In one you see the Mark that appeared on my arm, & in 3 I caught the Extraterrestrials On Camera, got lots of pics. Figured-Out how to push them out of my eye & photograph them in my glasses. They can Shrink & Expand Their Ghost-Size. I have a video of them sticking their heads out of the Ghastly-Triangles & doing stuff, but your Web-Page won't let me load it. If you look around your own house, you'll find they are everywhere, but, I have all the answers, info, & cooperation from them, you likely won't get it without me. They are Telepathic. The Ships can be heard like EVP on Background-Noise & likely can be translated easily with good ghost-hunting equipment. I know how to hack the Ships of the Extraterrestrials Open & Get to Their Physical Selves. There are Many Different Species of Them, because each batch is made different. They have black-outfits.

Walking back to my house from my barn, I observed a round, white object hanging in the near sky above my house.  I estimate the distance to be several thousand feet up in the air.  A jet had passed over about 5 minutes before and was very high in the sky, unlike the object.  It was high, but not like a plane. 
 
The object was bright white, or white-translucent, or oscillating.  The shape was circular with a hollow center, like a donut.  Also, it seemed to be hanging in the air at an angle, like you would tilt a hat on your head – it wasn’t horizontal.  Direction was North, I live at the 45th parallel in what locals call ‘Northwest Lower Michigan’. 
 
The object was hanging in the air and there was no sound, and I observed it for 2 minutes when I went inside my house to get binoculars.  The binoculars revealed a closer look at the object, which I estimate to be the size of a minivan.  I watched the object, switching between unassisted eyesight and the binoculars for 5 minutes.  Towards the end of the time I observed the object, a single red light appeared on its West facing side.  I returned to my house to lay the binoculars down, and when I returned a moment later, the craft was gone. 
 
I telephoned the local Coast Guard at approximately 11:30PM the same evening, who told me “they hadn’t seen anything” and advised me to call the police.  I telephoned the police non-emergency the next morning (today) and was met with similar disinterest and doubt.

I was driving to work (grave yard shift) and I see three extremely bright lights shoot half way across sky and then they stopped. I'm know Physics Major!!  But it seems unbelievable what I was witnessing!  I have never even consider the existence of UFOs.  But what I saw that  night was undeniable!!   
 
The speed of these things were traveling Impossible in my own mind  but yet I was seeing it.  I mean halfway across the sky and it stopped what appeared to be on a dime!  I would  not believe what i seen .   if I wouldn't saw it myself

On Friday, July 27, 2012, at approximately 20:57 EDT (00:57 UTC), I noticed a bright cylindrical object in the southern sky, moving from east to west.  I at first thought it was a low-lying commercial aircraft, however it was moving very slowly and I did not see any structure resembling an airfoil.  I then thought perhaps it was a blimp.  I had access to a pair of 7x50 field glasses.  With magnification, I was not able to see any tail structure, propellers or gondola, therefore I ruled out the notion that it was an airship. 
 
The object was cylindrical in shape, with the forward end wider than the tail end, somewhat resembling an elongated tear drop.  It also somewhat resembled the shape of a helicopter, however I did not see anything resembling a main or tail rotor.  The object was metallic in color, and reflected the orange-pink hues of the setting sun.  It made no sound that I could hear and was not emitting any vapor trail.  I did not observe any type of navigational or warning lights on the object. 
 
By my best estimate, the object when I first observed it was 3 to 5 miles due south of Hagerstown, Indiana (Wayne County).  It appeared to be traveling parallel to Interstate 70.  I estimated its altitude to be between 2000 to 4000 feet, and I estimated its speed to be no more than 25 miles per hour (again supporting my thought that it was an airship).  It appeared to maintain a steady course and altitude.  When I first observed the object, it was at almost 90 degrees on the east-west horizontal plain.  I watched it until it was no longer visible due to tall trees and a near-by building.  My last sight of the object was at 21:07 EDT (01:07 UTC).  I did not see it actually disappear over horizon.  I would estimate its position to be at approximately 160 degrees on the east-west horizontal plain. 
 
I am an avid aviation enthusiast and student of military aviation, as well as a former student pilot.  I have a good familiarity of both civil and military aircraft.  I am 48 years old and have had a keen interest in UFOlogy since childhood.  I have no explanation of what the object was, therefore I felt compelled to report this sighting to NUFORC.",39.9246,-85.1597

While leaving the Smokey Bones restaurant in Fort Wayne, Indiana, tonight (Friday, Sept. 18, 2015) around 9:10 p.m., I looked up at the sky after noticing sheet lightning in the NE and wondered if a thunderstorm was rolling in.   
 
As I turned around to get into the car, I saw three bright orange lights in a “V” formation and a fourth “straggler” slightly behind, moving slowly across the sky from the SW toward the NE.   
 
My husband was already in the car and I told him to get out and take a look.  We both were watching the 4 lights, which seemed to disappear behind the thick cloud cover, but as we again turned to get into the car, there was another group of 4 orange lights, the first 3 in V-formation.  This time the 4th one was much further behind, but they all were traveling SW to NE.   
 
Because our intention tonight was to get the grocery shopping done, we drove over to Meijer.  As we parked the car in the Meijer lot, we could still the 4th “straggler” of the second group of orange lights and we stood in the parking lot watching until the light seemed to fade behind the clouds.   
 
My husband dismissed these orange lights as most likely “military.”  But they were not your typical air plane lights.  They were orange, with a slight yellow waver and were steady with no blinking.  The speed at which they traveled was slower than a plane, but made me think of a glider.  As far as I could tell, they made no sound.  All I could hear was highway traffic and shopping center traffic.   
 
We saw these unusual lights flying in this formation above a busy outdoor shopping mall, with people coming and going from the theater and restaurants.  I was looking around for someone else to look up or someone close enough that we could talk to and ask if they could see these lights too, but the people we saw were too far away and/or on their cell phones!  What were these lights?  Weather balloons?  Drones?  A group of eight people flying gliders at night?

Me and some friends were having a fire that lasted until 1 am when we decided to put it out.

Around 3 am me and my 2 friends decided to go outside on the front porch and smoke a cigarette. As we were smoking I was looking towards the tree line on the other side of the road and saw something very unusual. There was a very large spherical craft floating right above the tree line. As I kept looking i alerted the other group members and we all were in awe as we watched it hover across the road into the neighbors field about 50 ft. From the house. This object was hovering approximately 100 ft off the ground and did not have any sound coming from it, it was very close to us. We watched this hover in one spot for 10 minutes. The craft started to ascend upward and then within a blink of an eye it disappeared, there wer! e no lights on the craft. We could see the whole thing because it was a full moon that night. The thing that bothers me the most, i recorded the whole encounter on my phone from start to finish. When it disappeared into the night, I reviewed the footage and it was heavily distorted.

The crafts were an orangish red color and circular.  There were no light tails, just the colored balls.  8 of them were grouped together, 4 on top and 4 on bottom flying south (left).  They were not in perfect formation.  The 9th craft was flying the opposite direction to the north (right). 
 
About a minute after observing 4 of the crafts flying south faded out quickly like they had started flying further west out of sight or just disappeared.  Similarly the one flying north had disappeared as well.   
 
The remaining 4 flew slower still south a few more minutes.  The one going north that had gone away reappeared and changed course to go south.  The 4 others faded out like the first 4 had withing 10 seconds. 
 
I then tracked the one remaining that had re-appeared and turned south for 2 minutes.  It got brighter for a about 20 seconds like it might be getting closer then it did the same as the others.  It took about 10 seconds and faded out.

I was in my SUV heading out to a convenience store it was about 9:15 pm.  I live in a cul-de-sac, so I had turned out of the circle and was headed straight to a dead end where you have to turn right or left onto another street.  I stopped at the stop sign and right in front of me I saw an orange kind of triangular shape that almost reminded me of a flame.  At first I just watched it, trying to figure out what it was… I’d never seen anything like it.  It wasn’t big, so I doubt it was a UFO.  It was all light, but it wasn’t casting light.  It might have been more like a very vague circle in the center but a peak on the top and a tail trailing it.  It was moving at a slow speed but was constantly moving forward.  I finally thought to grab my phone to take a picture, but the picture turned out terrible.  It went behind a tree, then I could see it again, then it was blocked by a tree. 
 
I turned the opposite way of where I intended to drive just to follow it.  I was trying to get a picture, but by the time I got to the last tree it was behind, it was gone.  I kept driving ahead looking for it.  I even went back home and picked up my daughter (26 years old) and drove around looking for it. 
 
It was just the strangest thing I’ve ever seen.  It was higher than the top of my SUV, but seemed to be very close.  It didn’t make any noise.  It reminded me of a flickering flame.  It was maybe two foot?  It was not big. 
 
I can see it clearly in my mind, but it’s so hard to describe.  An orange, almost triangular, light that reminded me of a flickering candle.  It was solid orange.  I don’t believe in supernatural or anything, but it really reminded me more of an entity than a spacecraft. 
 
I am 54 years old, female.  I have a Master’s degree in education.  I’ve taught Middle School ELA for the last 30 years. Most 8th grade, but this year I’m teaching 6th grade.  I’m married.  My husband came here from Macedonia – I met him when he’d been in the US for a year.  We’ve been married 24 years in October.  He is a family physician. I have two daughters – a 26 year old daughter who is currently working toward a Master’s degree in Environmental Science.  My other daughter is an 8th grader. 
 
We live in a development and had our house built about 10 years ago. 
 
There are a couple of boys that would fly these planes around.  That was the first thing I thought about when I saw this thing.  It wasn’t shaped like a plane, however, or a drone.  It was just a triangular, orange, light.  And, when I left my house and drove down out of the Cul-de-sac, there was no one else outside.  It was dark and a school night. 
 
That’s it.  It really bothers me wondering what I saw.  If you do know of something that resembles what I described that could explain it, I would really appreciate it if you’d tell me.  I’m not sure why it bothers me, except that it was so unusual….

On March 19th at about 5:45 pm we were merging on to I-10, Intersection 203, Capital Circle NW, Tallahassee.  As we were making the final merge onto the interstate I noticed a bright glow on the underside of one of the few white clouds that were in the sky.  As I looked harder I noticed a dark line pointing up towards it at about a 45 degree angle. 
 
I kept my eye on it until it disappeared behind trees, due to the bends in the I-10.  About 7-10 minutes later we were approaching Intersection 196, Capital Circle NE, when we finally got a good look at what we’d seen from a distance. 
 
There were two objects.  The first was a small, highly reflective, bullet shaped object with no wings or tail.  The second was rather more startling.  Keeping pace behind the bullet shaped object was ‘V’ shaped object that was quite simply the biggest think  I've ever seen in the sky.  Although a good distance away it was easily the size of a football stadium, possibly larger.  The object was dark gray/brown in color. 
 
My wife was quite shaken up by this.  I was excited!  She slammed on the breaks pretty hard on the off ramp when she saw this thing and noticed other people around her doing the same thing, looking up at the sky. 
 
Anyone passing Intersection 196, heading west, MUST have got an even better view of it.  And it says something as to how slow it was moving if we managed to catch up with it.",30.46589722,-84.2590155

Me and some friends were out on a street corner in Loveland Ohio on a park bench next to Tano Bistro (I used a website with google maps to figure out our exact location, which was Latitude:N 39° 16' 4.893"" Longitude:W 84° 15' 30.5551""), when we saw these 3 whitish-orange lights in a triangle formation starting to rise up from the horizon (South/Southeast) going really fast.  I got my phone out and started taking video of the lights, when another formation of lights rose up, this time there were five lights, the same color, in a much larger, somewhat uneven triangle pattern (Same direction).  At this point people walking down the street, and eating outside at Tano stopped what they were doing to watch it, many getting out their phones as well and recording it.  There was at least one child next to me that was really scared.  Both sets of lights continued to rise up form the horizon, appearing to rise almost vertically, before vanishing as we watched, while passing overhead.  I'm still not sure whether they were 2 separate craft with multiple lights on each, or 8 craft with one light each.  I live in the area, and come to this spot all the time, and I've never seen anything like this in my life.

This morning, Friday, July 28, 2017, around 11 am, I was sitting at my computer in my back bedroom.  I could hear this strange noise far off and I was wondering what it was.   
 
At first, I thought maybe it was an airplane, but the sound was just so odd, I remain sitting as the sound became louder, I wanted to get up and go look out my sunroom window (like I usually do}, but for some reason, I just couldn't move!  As the noise got louder, I could tell that it was coming closer to my location and it was moving fast.   
 
Finally I jumped up and ran into my living room and looked out my sunroom window, by the time I reached my window I could tell that it was passing over my apartments and moving fast.  Once I pulled back my blinds I notice that the sky was hazy and there were 2 Gwinnett County Police Officers facing in my direction and looking in the sky.   
 
First, I was surprised because I had no idea that the Police was outside, and secondly I immediately notice them looking up in th! e sky with a shocked look on their faces.  They seems shocked and confused and one of them had his mouth open like WTH is that!!   
 
I noticed that the noise had all of a sudden stopped and I could no longer hear it.  I tried to scan the limited amount of sky in my view and that's when I noticed how ""Hazy"" the sky was.  I watched the Police for a few minutes to see what they was going to do.  They both stayed focus on the sky and finally turn to one another and started talking, after a few more minutes of talking, one got into his car and left and went to another locations by the security gates.   
 
The second Police officer stayed behind for a few more minutes, and then they both followed each other out the complex.  I have no idea what they were looking at, but I'm certain that whatever that weird loud noise was in the sky, they saw it!  No doubt in my mind because I can't forget the shocked look on their faces!!   
 
After they left, I called my cousin, who had gone to Publix grocery store to see if he heard that strange LOUD noise because I cou!d tell that it was coming from that direction (141& Holcomb bridge) toward me (Holcomb bridge Rd toward Peachtree Corners).  He immediately said that they could hear it, but no one knew what it was!!  There is a lot of strange objects in the sky in the Peachtree Corners area, on any day at any time you can witness them.  I noticed that if you have sunglasses on, you will be able to see them clearly,  I have taken my sunglasses off and I could barely see them, but once I put them back on, I can plainly see them.  They do disappear, which makes it hard to capture them on video or take pics.  I don't worry too much because I know I will see them again because they are ALWAYS flying around.  I was able to capture one on video on July 10, however this particular object has been around for years so I wasn't too concern about getting the video but I decided to take it anyway before it disappeared because it will disappear on you and reappear somewhere else.",33.91958564,-84.18897475

I just sat and looked at them, thinking how neat it was they were so bright…so I actually observed them for a few minutes.  Suddenly the white one on the lower left moved toward the west and went off or behind something…it was a measured, deliberate movement….not a “shooting off” quickly.   
 
I looked back to the upper right one, and it went straight down and out of sight with the same deliberate motion…and I just sat there with my mouth open, looking around to see if anyone else saw it (I was alone in the parking lot), and wondered what the heck I had just seen.

Me and my wife were outside at 2:00pm and saw 2 ships.  One small ship and one very large ship.  It came right over the trees with NO sounds at all.   
 
Both were traveling at speeds we have never see a flying aircraft fly at.  The first ship seemed to be trying to get away from the lager ship.   
 
About 10 seconds in the larger ship lite up a very bright orange and seemed to shot out 3 laser beams or fire balls at the first ship.  The first ship avoid them and seemed to go faster the it was traveling before.  After about other 10 to 15 seconds and more good flying the smaller ship went right up and the lager one follow it.  No sound at all the hole time.   
 
I would say that the lager ship was about 2 miles long and a teardrop shape.  Please let me know if any one else saw this.

I was driving home down a dark back road.  For some reason I looked up to my left and I saw a HUGE formation of red lights in a long line.  There were at least 10-15 lights in a row dimly pulsating but sequentially.  When I spotted it I immediately said ""what the HELL is that"" and I never say hell in front of my kids. 
 
Immediately I thought...""wait, it has to be a string of lights over a  production plant or something"" because there were several in the area.  Or maybe part of a tower even though they were horizontal.  So I thought maybe they were on the top of a very tall fence or strung across something.  It looked pretty close and low like maybe a half mile away.   
 
When I went down a hill, it went behind the trees and when I popped up it had moved.  This continued and I continued watching it move steadily across in front of me and eventually continue on to my right. I was travelling due West and it went from south to north so now I knew it was not stationary lights.  During this time, I could see it in relation to several planes flying overhead and could tell it was much further out then they were, therefore, further than I had thought in the first place.  It wasn't in outer space.  It as within the radar airspace, but higher than a fixed engine would fly. 
 
I was driving so I couldn't count the lights and study it for long periods of time.  I had to keep looking at the road so I wouldn't wreck and I didn't want to pull over on a narrow shoulder on this dark road.  I noticed that it looked like it was in fog because the lights were hazy and would look as if they would just dim out any minute as they were pulsating so I thought the sky must be hazy but after I got to where I could no longer see it,.  Looked up and noticed that all the planes and stars were very bright.  The sky was crystal clear with a very bright moon. 
 
This thing was either a formation of many crafts or it was one HUGE craft that had lights outlining it.  I got the impression that it was probably a massive craft with lights on it because there was also a light in front of it and also because the lights stayed in such a perfect straight line.  It moved very very slowly and if it was so far away that it looked hazy and slow, then that means it was far bigger than I thought.  Just one light was the size of the planes in the sky maybe little smaller so if you can imagine at least 10-15 red lights lined up in a row, that is one big UFO. 
 
Even if I had taken a picture, it wouldn’t have turned out because the lights were so dim, not at all bright like the planes. 
 
I am 46 and have never seen anything like this. It was totally unfamiliar and unusual.",33.9916,-83.8901

I was using the binoculars to watch a family of falcons near the woodline to the south of where I was sitting.  It was a hot, clear day.  Not a cloud in the sky, visibility was for miles from the sky, I'm sure.  
 
There were also high flying aircraft in the sky that day, and from time to time I was pointing the binoculars to get a look at the aircraft and their contrails.  I've been an aviation enthusiast for my entire life and have attended countless airshows featuring both military and civilian aircraft.  There was an aircraft flying at high altitude, leaving a contrail.  I followed it with the binoculars as it traveled from south to the north.   
 
After following it for approximately 10 seconds or so, I noticed a strange metallic glint just to what would have been the aircraft's 8 o'clock.  I remember thinking, ""wow.. that plane is close to the other one.."" but then realized that this object wasn't moving, and wasn't leaving contrails like all the other aircraft at that altitude were.  I pulled the binoculars away to see if I could see the object without the aid of the optics, but I couldn't - so I looked through them again, found the object again.  It was completely stationary.  Definitely metallic.  I remember seeing the sun glimmering off the surface.   
 
It was far away, and I was using 7x50 power binoculars..  I could tell it was egg shaped with what appeared to be.. spikes jutting from the craft.  I looked away from the binoculars again to try again with my naked eye, but couldn't see it.  I went back to the binoculars and was unable to find it again.  I'm under the assumption that it must've left the area, as I was unable to find it again. I was unable to obtain a picture, much to my consternation.",33.52774206,-83.85899444

It was similar to a laser pointer being moved around. Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be multiple ""stars"" and they maintained vertical distance and consistent speed. It was far too slow for a shooting star and far smaller than a typical aircraft light signature. They were not in a straight line. They were consistent in their movement and near the cloud line (at times appeared to be just below, than in the clouds than just slightly in the clouds). As a pilot, I would say they had the same altitude. They were not fast moving, but I can not really estimate how quickly they moved. I have no explanation, but contact AFRCC and they advised me to contact you.

It looked/colored like a giant oblong rock with a row of square black windows that didn’t reflect light running the center length of it. I realized it was going to cross the road ahead of me from right to left so I matched its speed of 60mph so I could pass underneath it.  The object was about 150ft-300ft in the air.  The objects size was about 300ft long, 100ft tall, and at least 200ft wide (it took 2-3 seconds to pass beneath it).  There were no wings, rotors, or any visible means of propulsion. The object was not an airplane, blimp, helicopter, and was not being towed or carried from above.  Looking out the drivers side window I passed under and the bottom was flat, black, with a symbol running the fo! rward width of it (a white circle with a single white line on either side), and the length of the object was elongated oval.  While driving underneath I felt an odd downward pressing feeling.  Looking back thru the drivers side window the opposite side was the same as I first approached it.  I turned to look forward and a driver in the opposite lane was approaching me and was looking up thru their windshield in awe at the object I had just driven under.  I turned to look back thru my drivers side window as the other driver passed me and the object had moved away continuing northwest.  The encounter lasted about 30-60 seconds.

I looked to see if there was anyone else around who may have seen the object but I was the only one on the road.  It did however spook the wildlife I could tell.  The deer were running full speed as well as an owl that flew out of the woods in the area that the object had been.

I did not feel threatened in any way, just a sense that I had witnessed something phenomenal.  I feel that it is my duty to report such an unusual occurrence.

On April 13th 2021 at around 10:30 PM I was out on my back porch sky gazing when I saw a small round light moving from the southwest toward the northeast much faster than an airliner say at 33,000 feet.  Based on an airliner speed of 400-450 knots at altitude moving across the night sky, I would estimate this object was moving close to 1200 knots.  I’ve seen what a satellite looks like moving across the sky, but this object was nearly 4 times the size of what a very small satellite looks like in the sky.  They are very difficult to see.  This was very easy to see.  I don’t believe it was a satellite.  There was no sound associated with it, no anti-collision lights, nor a contrail and it flew in a straight line northeasterly and dimmed out of view.

While walking our dogs, we paused at the school’s practice field to take a look at the stars. I pointed out what I thought was the Big Dipper to my husband. We were talking about it and also noticed several passenger places (we’re about 30 miles from CMH airport). We then noticed what looked like, upon first glance, a meteor entering the atmosphere. We quickly realized it couldn’t be a meteor or shooting star because it was moving too slowly at a nearly 90-degree angle towards the earth. (It was moving at a much slower rate than the planes.) We also noticed what looked like an elongated, cigar-shaped, faint outline following the orangish-light. We started walking in its direction to try to get a better look and we could clearly see an outline that would form a massive, cigar-shaped object. After a minute or two of watching it, it appeared to slow down even further and it flashed a rapid succession of 6-8 consecutive lights in a perfectly straight line (there did appear to be greater separation between the first and second light, then the next few were perfectly spaced and then another space before the next light). This further solidified that we had the shape/size correct as the lights were spread out across the midline of the object, across its entire length, which was hard to determine, but we’re guessing was at least 1,000 yards long. After the lights lit up, they quickly flashed off. The object appeared to hover in its place and slowly pivot to be horizontal (parallel to the earth).

We left the restaurant at 8:15 to go back to her residence and started walking south on South Sandusky Street.  We made a right on Spring St. towards South Franklin where the car was parked.  We passed a paint store and came to an open lot with a relatively open view of the sky.   
 
As we were walking, I noticed a red, almost pinkish, light through breaks in the northerly cloud bank.  A front was passing the area and cloud deck was low over the city and I thought that a Chicago flight was descending through the clouds to land at Port Columubs 30 miles south.  There is always heavy air traffic over the city.   
 
I directed my girlfriend's attention to the light and we saw that it was descending through the cloud in an unusual manner.  The light suddenly disappeared and in its place was a jet black disk that slowly moved south.   
 
We both had, pardon the expression, a WTH moment.  The disk was the size of a half dollar piece, held at arm's lenth, and silent.   
 
Now this is where it gets eerie.  As the disk moved south I half joking said, ""Why don't you stop.""  As if it heard me the craft immediately stopped and hovered, maintaining its altitude.  The craft was tilted slightly to us and we could see that it had a spinning band around the middle.  We could also see that the upper portion of the craft was lit and illuminating the cloud cover above it.   
 
We had an uneasy feeling that whoever was in the craft was observing us observing them.   
 
It hovered for two minutes and then resumed a south eastern direction over the Ohio Wesleyan campus and was gone.

UFO Summary  I have been somewhat negligent in writing this ufo sighting summary.  I believe part of it is due to life events, as well as concern whether or not my report can provide any value, compared to other reports I have heard and read.  However, this event has periodically plagued my mind for the last two years and I believe by providing this report, and possibly talking to someone regarding my incident, I may be able to find some sort of closure.  I will try to be as accurate and descriptive as possible.  Please feel free to reach out with any questions you may have.  Also, if time permits, I would greatly appreciate someone reaching out to me for the purpose of helping me process this event. 
 
Event Sighting:  I believe this event occurred in approximately March or April of 2017.  The time was at approximately 9:00pm.  The location of this event occurred in the parking lot of Planet Fitness located at 1175 Hill Road North Pickerington, Ohio 43147.  I was walking into the Planet Fitness to work out, when I happened to look in the sky, oriented in the Southern direction.  Initially, I just happened to look up very briefly almost as if by impulse.  When I looked up, I happened to see lights in the sky and did not think anything of it.  I then immediately looked back down to see where I was walking as I was in parking lot about to cross into a driving lane.  Almost instantaneously, as I looked down, my mind recognized that something seemed abnormal about the lights.  As I realized this abnormality, I looked back again and became very uncomfortable with what I began witnessing.  While the event itself may not seem “spectacular” in any way reading this, I can assure you that as an observe! r, it was a very unnerving event once my mind started processing what I was viewing. 
 
As I looked back up at the sky in a Southern direction, I saw 4 lights that I would characterize as a somewhat muted red/orange.  It will be somewhat difficult to describe distances and dimensions, but I will try my best.  If you can imagine me standing on the ground looking up at the lights, I would say the object was approximately 60 degrees in the air, using the flat ground as a 0 degree baseline.  The lights appeared to be approximately 1,000 feet away, in the Southern direction from my location at 1175 Hill Road North Pickerington, Ohio 43147.  The lights were traveling in an East by North-East direction, very slowly.  From a general observation perspective, I would say they were travelling at approximately 8 miles an hour.  The immense uncomfortability in that moment came when I began truly trying to understand what I was observing. 
 
As I looked up to analyze the 4 muted red/orange lights, I could see that these lights were moving in what appeared to be exact unison.  At first I thought they may be some sort of airplanes very far away.  I took specific note of their movement in attempts to understand what I was seeing but again, when I truly attempted to analyze the lights, it was apparent that there was no visible variance between their distance relative to one another.  I also realized that it was a cloudy night with clouds fairly close to the ground, and these lights were clearly visible under the clouds.  This ruled out any chance of these being distant aircraft.  This realization made me believe that these lights were much nearer than I initially expected,and that they must have been been affixed to the same originating object.  They were almost directly over a water tower.  I became increasingly uncomfortable as I began to perceive the size of the object these lights seemed to be a part of.  If these lights truly were on the same object, I would venture to guess that the “craft” was the size of a football field.  Oddly, the lights were oriented in a “diamond” shape, in relation to the trajectory of the craft (East by North-East).  I will try to explain the 4 lights’ positions using the illustration below.  Points A,B,C, and D almost exactly illustrates the location of the lights in relation to one another.  Again, in this illustration, the craft was moving in an upward and left direction from my perspective, meaning that the light at point D was “leading” the craft. 
 
I could hear absolutely no sound that would be indicative of a massive flying object this close to my location.  I also began having the overwhelming and distinct feeling of fear, terror, and powerlessness.  While I can not say I actually saw the body of the object, I would say my mind “worked out” the shape of the craft while I was viewing this.  I could almost see the outline of a black shape almost the exact shape above, but I cannot tell if I truly observed it with my eyes or if my mind “filled in the gaps” from the lights.  At this point of my viewing/analysis, the lights began being obscured by the clouds and eventually disappeared above the clouds. 
 
Unfortunately I was so mesmerized by this event that I did not think to take a picture with my phone.  Overall, from initial sighting to disappearance, I would say the entire event lasted only 10-15 seconds.  However, the event felt like minutes. 
 
Almost as soon as the 4 lights seemingly connect to the massive craft disappeared, I happened to see what appeared to be a brownish orb coming down from the sky.  With myself still looking in the Southern sky at  the same location, the orb was falling from the East approximately 600 feet from me.  I will be honest and say I have no idea what to make of the orb.  I noticed it when it was approximately 80-100 feet off the ground and falling at approximately 8-10 feet per second.  The orb was behaving like, and almost the size of a grocery bag in light wind but something did not seem right about it.  The orb seemed too illuminated to be just a bag.  Again, it was 9:00pm at night and this object was almost 600 feet from me.  There were street lights across the street in the direction of the orb but I cannot see any way how an average street light would have been able to illuminate the orb as brightly as it was.  Also, the orb fell to what seemed the ground from a height of appro! x. 100 feet.  Logically, it the orb was illuminated by the street light, the appearance and intensity of the illumination would have varied considerably.  While there was some variation on the surface of the orb in relation to its brightness, it did not seem to match what one would expect from its orientation to the street light.  Also, the surface exterior of the orb seemed to fluctuate. It seemed to have indentations and protrusions that continuously varied in positions to one another, but there were no sharp edges.  As the object was falling to the ground, I lost sight of it once it neared the ground and honestly, I did not stay there to see if it reappeared.  The amount of fear I began feeling propelled me to jump into my car and “hide” so to speak.  I would say the orb sighting lasted approximately 8 seconds. 
 
Reporting To Police: After sitting in my car for a few moments, maybe 15 minutes trying to figure out what in the heck just occurred, I decided to contact the police.  I decided to call the actual police station rather than 911. As I have written a lot so far, I will summarize by conversation briefly.  I asked the operator who answered the phone at the police station if anyone has reported odd lights in the sky.  The operator paused for a moment and asked me what kind of lights.  Very hesitantly, and with telling telling her that I know I’ll sound crazy, I said “like unexplainable lights.”  I briefly described what I saw in regards to the lights.  She stated that no one has reported anything tonight, but that an on-duty policeman reported something similar in almost the exact location I did, approximately 6 weeks or 6 months prior. Unfortunately I cannot remember if she said weeks or months but I  know she said 6.  She said that the policeman had reported the lights, tried to chase them and had ! absolutely no idea what they were.  She also stated that in that event, they called wright patterson airforce base to verify if they were flying craft(s) and the military said they had no craft in the area. 
 
Summary: Overall, I have no idea what to think of the orb but I can say with strong confidence that the 4 red/orange lights I saw were connected to an ariel object/craft in the sky.  I believe myself to be a fairly logical person and following this event, I have dwelled on this incident for hours.  Based on the exact uniform movement of the lights and their positioning in relation to one another, the color of the lights (which never blinked), the fact that they were visible under low cloud cover, the fact that I could hear absolutely zero sound indicative of an aerial vehicle, and the fact that a police officer observed something somewhat similar recently; I have no choice but to believe this was some sort of ufo (terrestrial or non-terrestrial). 
 
Overall, I wanted to share my story and see if anyone would be able to contact me to provide their thoughts on the event.  Again, this event has periodically plagued me for 2 years as I’m a very logical person who seeks the truth in all instances.  It is very unnerving to me to have experienced such an event that logically made absolutely no sense.  Also, the amount of primitive fear and powerlessness I experienced were profound.

My wife and I saw 3 spherical objects traveling from north to south about the size of a small car, dull titanium color flying in formation. They seem to be flying low relative to an aircraft which was traveling from Tampa airport due north. The 3 objects flew below the aircraft at a constant speed and formation. Estimate around 150-180 MPH. Initially I thought they were large balloons making a triangle shape based on my angle of observation, but then the leading objec swapped places with one of the object behind forming the triangle. The change in positions seemed coordinated and controlled. That was the moment I realize these were not balloons and were indeed self propelled. Due to their color, they seem to blend it well with the clear blue sky. I looked at a passing passenger aircraft and as soon as I took my eyes off of them, I was unable to see them. In contrast, my wife could still track them and see them. The closer they were from us was around 200 yards ground distance and about 300 yards above the ground. I am an Air Force veteran, an engineer in aerospace industry, and am familiar with all kinds of military manned and unmanned aircrafts.

((woman's name deleted)) my wife was sitting in the front enjoying the warm weather and talking on the phone with a friend.  It was a very clear night with no clouds in the sky. 
 
I came outside sat down and looked up and saw a fire ball in the sky over the tree line, traveling in a slightly northeast direction coming from the Gulf.  The craft at first site looked like a meteor or an asteroid, or something of the sort.  This thing was huge, and headed towards our direction, then I saw the other one appear, not as close that came into view rising above the tree line.  The images and video provided give no justice to what we originally saw because it was the tail end after the account and fly by. 
 
I was stunned, shocked and frozen in awe. While frozen I started to think this is no meteor or asteroid, I also thought could this be a plane on fire going to crash. I decided to rush in and get Sam my daughter out of the shower, because I was very uncertain what I saw and worried. 
 
I scrambled to find my video camera, could not find it and grabbed my digital camera instead. 
 
Once I got back outside they were already over the house and at a much higher altitude. I started snapping pictures of it with my digital camera.  ((daughter's name deleted)), my daughter started videotaping with her camera on video mode.  The images look like dots, sorry best I could do. 
 
((name deleted again)) my wife, has a very good account as they flew over when I was inside scrambling for my camera, she was outside the whole time.  My best guess, the size of the object was at least 5000 square feet round, there were two of them and they were silent, and made no noise whatsoever.  The objects were round, burning fire in the middle and glowing orange red around the parameter circling the burning center.  These objects were very bright. 
 
I will personally never doubt anyone who claims they saw something. Unfortunately, by the time I got my camera they were already over the house at a much higher altitude. Also, I was smoking, so you can see this in some of the pictures. Had I not been in such shock I would have not hesitated so long to grab something to record the incident sooner. 
 
((wife's)) Account  Jan 21st 2012 around 7:11 pm at night I saw something in the sky that was not any aircraft, like a helicopter, airplane, jet etc.  It had glowing fire in the middle and reddish orange colored lights surrounding the object.  The lights were circular and the whole thing glowed like an asteroid you see in the movies.  The objects were big and there were two objects in the sky.  Through the whole incident I was completely stunned and seemed to be emotionless. 
 
The first one came above the tree line across the street above my neighbor’s house then a second one followed.  They were flying low when they appeared then flew over our house.  As the object flew over I saw the fire in the middle and orange redish colored lights that seemed to be rotating while looking at them directly above me. 
 
As soon they passed over they speed up and started ascending much higher.  The craft looked like fire in the sky.  At that time ((name deleted)) and ((name deleted)) came outside with their camera's and started taking pictures and video.

Posted a report about a Dec 23rd sighting of a pulsating color changing light in the sky east of I75 in Manatee county. Well I saw it again this morning, this time in the Western sky over the gulf of mexico. Same object but much, much farther away. This time I was able to view it through binoculars for appx 30 minutes. Actually got my wife out of bed and made her watch it with me. I am a little freaked out as to what the heck this was. This time with the aid of 16x32 power and also 7x50 power bino's I was able too observe many, much smaller points of light dance all around the larger object. The large object again pulsated and changed from red to blue to green to yellow. It Appeared to remain stationary for the 1st 20 minutes of observation as the smaller red and blue points of light danced all around the large object. Had too be at least 10 to 12 of them but they were so fast and erratic in their movement that it was hard to confirm an exact count. After ap! px 20 minutes the small points of light just merged into the Large object and it slowly began to drift up and to the south. From my location/angle it appeared to rise in the sky about a foot and drift to the south about 4 feet. Then it just dissappeared like someone turned off a light. No flash, No nothing, just there one second gone the next. So now my wife and I are both freaked out a little and as we take our dogs for their morning walk as I proceed to tell her about my Dec 23rd sighting that occured the previous morning. Same object without the little light's dancing and much, much closer/larger. When we got home from walking the dogs I went back outside to see if anything had returned to the area in the sky we saw the object. Saw nothing at first but then I thought I might be seeing some twinkling lights around the same general area in the sky. Looked through the Bino's and saw 2 Military jets flying all around the area flying larger and larger circles. The scale of th! e jets were that of the small dancing light making the scale o! f the la rger object HUGE!!! This went on for appx 25mins then they headed out over the Gulf of Mexico out of site. Just like yesterday someone else had too see this. Any body looking to the west towards the Gukl around the same time could not have possibly missed these lights. They were very distinct and Bright. 0331exmc

I was driving home from the gym pulling back into my neighborhood late at night.  There were no other cars or people out as it was past 10:00.  When I was headed down my street toward my house I noticed a set of three lights aligned in a triangular pattern.  The lights came from the northeast and were moving toward the southwest.  As the craft was overhead I stopped my car and looked up at it.  It was moving extremely slow but very smoothly like it was just gliding over the ground.  The weirdest part is that this set of triangular moving lights made no sounds whatsoever.  I had the AC turned off, the radio turned off, and I even opened the car door for a second to see if I could hear what it was when I was getting freaked out.  The whole time nothing, not even the slightest sound.  When I looked really closely I realized that the craft was basically in the shape of a perfect triangle.  Eventually it glided so far I couldn't see it anymore.  I don’t know what! this could have been but it was completely silent and flying so low to the ground like maybe 100 feet off the roofs of the houses along the street it couldn't have been a drone, a plane, or a satellite.  I have literally no explanation for this but I know what I saw.

At first I didnt think anything of it since MacDill airforce base is located a few miles south from Gandy, in the direction I was headed.  But the speed of these aircraft was much faster than when you see a plane flying overhead.  Because of the oak trees that line Bayshore Blvd, my view was blocked for the next few streets until I turned onto Gandy.  I really was interested to see the aircraft again, but there was nothing in the sky anywhere.  I doubt these were military aircraft but I thought important to report this sighting of something that I suspect was UFO.  I hope this is helpful.

On 31 Oct 2013 at approximately 20:17 hours in Riverview, FL, while handing out candy with my wife and 3 year old daughter, I witnessed what I thought to be a fly over of the International Space Station again (it passed over our area a couple of days ago).  It was a bright light moving from Northwest to Southeast just as fast as the space station did but then it started to slow down, stop, change from a bright white to a red and green light, back to dim white, slowly move east, then slowly move north again.  I thought this to be extremely odd and that’s when I called my wife over to witness it with me.  We stood at the end of our driveway looking north and watched it change color and patterns a couple of times.  I asked my wife to film it with her Samsung Galaxy S III phone but because of the distance and with the light coming from my house (to inform trick-or-treater’s that we are handing out candy) the strange light in the sky didn’t show up on her phone.  At approximately 20:20 is when my next door neighbor came out from her house to see if there were any more kids going to stop by.  I asked her to come out to the end of her driveway with us to see if she knew what it was.  She thought it was odd as well but didn’t want to think too much about it.  We stood at the end of her driveway for about a minute and that’s when the strange light moved slowly north and behind some thin clouds moving in.  Soon after that, the strange light moved past the horizon of our home and out of view. 
 
My wife and I had hoped that it would have been seen by other parents out with their kids during this night and perhaps it would have been reported to a local media station, but after thinking about it, who really wants to report anything like this on Halloween? My thought process was to report it on this website in hopes it would produce some intelligent feedback. 
 
Kinda odd, but don’t want to think about it too much.  Would like to see if there is any feedback though.",27.8485768,-82.3217462

Sighting #12 – July 24, 2013 – 5th sighting of amber UFOs At 9:40 p.m.  I went to the beach across the street from where I live on the south end of Captiva Island, and immediately saw two of the amber lights I had now seen four times before in the past month, and the same lights described by another person from Cape Coral, some 8 miles to the NE of where I live.  The lights were SSW of me, about two finger-widths of my outstretched hand above the rock jetty at Blind Pass, and about one finger width apart.  I would reasonably guess that they were around 500 feet above the water, and two to three miles distant.  They appeared to be due west of my friend “Carol’s” house, two miles south on Sanibel Island. 
 
 Unfortunately, by the time I got my binoculars out and the lens caps off, they had disappeared. 
 
 What’s important here is that after exactly one month, they still showed up in the same location.  As I’ve stated in my previous reports to NUFORC, it now seems clear to me that there is some kind of a reason they are continually showing up  at this relatively isolated area.",26.5215,-82.1802

We live a few miles north of Zanesville, Ohio.  We heard some neighbors shooting off fireworks, so we went out to see. We looked to the west and saw one bright circular orange object moving from left to right. 
 
At first we thought it was one the rockets from the fireworks that had yet to burn itself out, mind you the fireworks had stopped going off at this point.   But it stayed lit and moved in a straight line, perfectly smooth. It appeared to be low in altitude and moved from south to north. It would estimate that it was between 30 to 45 degrees above the horizon.

But we looked it up and saw that the station was over the Atlantic ocean, which means it would have been on the eastern horizon moving away from us.   
 
I pulled out my phone and took a video of the object.  It was already halfway across the sky when we got out there. It lasted 1:30 -2 minutes tops.  As it moved farther away, it appeared to dim, and then completely disappeared, my guess is that it went behind a cloud.  But the clouds appeared to be cirrus, meaning they were quite high in altitude. 
 
I looked up the weather for our area and saw that the wind speeds were calm (less than 5mph) and SSE.  So the wind was blowing the same direction as the object.",39.92855043,-82.00382609

April 14 the United States witness on media television a green fireball that passed through several states.  Many scientists, astronomers, government officials and government agencies have labeled it as a meteorite.   
 
I don’t believe it was as I believe that if something were to be seen by many as evidence, many still would not believe as the expression goes, even if it were to bite them on their rear ends. 
 
There is a video taken from the police dashboard of the sighting.  The strange thing that I wanted to report was that during the viewing of the dash board video there is silence as it was a quiet street that the officer was parked.  However, if you turn your theater home speakers up and turn up the bass something strange happens.  You  hear this heavy strong engine bursting sound going off and on as if something is cruising through space.   
 
As the night turns to day you see the green ""round"" fire ball appear and then the sound goes quiet until you hear an explosion and the object darts off into the horizon with no trails.  The strange part is that upon turning the sound up the volume gets caught or stuck and if you pause the film you will continue to hear it unless you close the file and re-open.   
 
Final note is that as the object darts of or at the end of the footage you will hear the police radio pick up something.    I believe it will be in the best interest of sound technicians to analyze this film footage.",41.08866951,-81.52723162

Friday Morning: 9/10/2021 Time: 00:30 I had just gotten off work and was driving north on highway 17 in Brunswick.  I noticed a bright white light in the sky way up ahead of me.  At first glance I thought it was a star, then a plane with its landing lights on, but as it grew nearer, I realized it had no lights where a typical plane would have them and the white light was much brighter.  The white light seemed to take up the entire front of the aircraft.  As it got closer, it slowly descended out of the low flying clouds and was headed straight towards me where 17 and Community road connect.  I thought at first, OK, this is a Chinook helicopter being used by the military for something.  But as it came over me, I had my window down looking up at the aircraft, it made no sound. It was cigar shaped, long, about the length of a Chinook helicopter.  The front end of the aircraft was bright white, the body was yellow orange, and the rear was red and yellow. The red and yellow pulsated back and forth. The bottom, as ! it went over, had round circular objects on it in a line similar to what you would see on an electric razor.  It looked like 3 in a line side by side, a total of 6, and they were different colors.   It continued its path down the coast towards Jacksonville. It was so bright, it seemed to glow as it flew away from me. I turned to follow it but realized it was traveling much faster than I was. I watched it as it flew out of sight just above the tree line. Glowing and pulsating as it disappeared over the trees.

I was in a local parking lot talking in the phone with a friend.  It's a parking lot with several businesses in it, restaurants and stores.  I was facing east.  Around 8:45 p.m. I started to see about 30- 40 lights shoot up into the sky.  There was roof tops in my way but it appeared to be shooting up from ground maybe 500 feet away from me.  They were orange/yellow color.  After shooting up and the lights moving down the sky, forming a chevron like pattern, I was able to snap 2 different photos from my cell.  I then decided to drive towards where this was happening, because I wanted to get a closer look, and also was trying to figure out what it was that I was seeing.  So as I was driving towards it, the lights went into triangle shapes, and then I saw a HUGE V.  The V was stationary.  By that time I had pulled into another parking lot and had a great view, got out of my car and went to take a photo, the lights from the V then shut off, only 1 remained.  I snapped a photo of that.  The one light remained for about 5-10 minutes before phasing out.  I could clearly see what looked like a mothership above the V lights.  The other lights I saw that took formation, different formations, seem to be like smaller craft going to the bigger craft.  The thing is, no one else seem to see it that night or at least I've not heard any reports.  I kept checking  social media, I asked a few people if they saw anything in the sky that night, no one else seems to of seen it.  I reached out to four different ex military men, some are family, a couple friends. I showed them the photos, and they have all said they have never seen anything like it and that when you zoom in the photos I have, it is pretty crazy and creepy.  You can clearly see several smaller aircraft.  I can say it's left me a little unsettled, as I KNOW what I saw, but still can't believe what I saw!",39.4251,-81.4613

Took my dog out around 7pm at the intersection of Lake Baldwin Lane and Starboard Street. It was just before a storm so it was a little dark and windy but the sky was relatively clear as you could look out west over the lake and see the storm cell approaching. As I looked out at the approaching storm I caught 4 bright lights moving very fast across the horizon heading north. They appeared from kinda below the tree line but also where there was a small clearing in the tree line so it was a brief window but it was long enough to see them clearly. They were moving in sync and evenly spaced apart. They were all bright and all the same size and color which was white. There was no body to them. It was just light. They were in front of the storm cloud, but behind the tree line and also just below the tree line. The cloud did not appear too far away - my guess would be College Park at the furthest. They were moving a lot faster than any plane would move if it was flying any where through that area. Also, it was still day light so I could see there was nothing between them and they were not attached to anything. No noise. No contrail.

My wife was coming home from the store when she called me on the phone and told me to go outside to look at something she saw in the sky as she was pulling in the driveway.

It was at a roughly 55 to 60 degree angle and I was facing to the North-West. By non-military time it was 7:54 P.M. EST. 
 
It appeared to be stationary, very bright, and at first very star-like. As we were watching the light we noticed it was moving slowly towards the horizon. I went inside and got my mother and grandmother to both come outside to see it as well. The object got brighter and seemed to pulsate with a brightness and shine to it. We watched the light descend out of view appearing to drop down below the horizon. 
 
From the time I first walked outside and saw the bright light to the time it went below the horizon I viewed the light for at least ten to fifteen minutes.  There was other traffic in the air and I noticed at least one commercial air-liner heading toward Daytona International Airport. From my perspective the light we were looking at seemed to be much higher than the commercial traffic heading toward Daytona.

I knew they weren't balloons though because 1) they glided sideways with ease, not erratically and 2) they never floated upwards, just sideways and 3) there were no strings attached, as there would be had a child lost their balloon.  
 
They moved slowly, and I only got a short glimpse of them as I was driving, but they were light grey and entirely unmarked.   
 
Another interesting aspect was at first I only saw 2 of them, but then one of the spheres seemed to split in half, and a third craft became visible, and then a fourth which also appeared from the same area as the other craft.  It looked like a fifth was emerging when I lost sight of them.  I don't know if I was just at a strange angle and saw them simply moving out from behind another craft or if they actually merged out from one another.  I couldn't get an image, unfortunately, of anything as traffic was somewhat chaotic and my eyes had to be on the road. 
 
I'm not entirely sure what I saw at all,

On September 15, 2018, at approximately 5:45 PM Eastern Standard Time from Painesville Township, Ohio, in Lake County, I was witness to a group of 6 UFO’s.  The sky was clear blue and I first saw the UFO’s in the Southeast sky traveling Northwest at an estimated speed similar to airliners.  There was a cluster of 4 UFO’s with 2 more UFO’s trailing.  They were not in a symmetrical pattern, but they did stay in formation.   
 
At first glance I thought it was a group of balloons that somebody released, because even though the UFO’s were traveling in a straight path, they had the appearance of floating through the sky like balloons or bubbles.  I say they were bubble-like because when I was looking at them, they were traveling in a straight-line trajectory, but they seemed to each individually be floating like bubbles with a small wobble.  The UFO’s were round and white and did appear to have a reflective surface but there were no visible lights or changing of colors.  I know! they were not balloons because they did not separate from each other and they moved too fast.  I recorded the UFO’s with my G9 Samsung phone and was able to capture about 30 seconds of quality footage.  The UFO’s are not blatantly obvious when watching the video, but if you take the time to pause the video and zoom, you can see them all no problem.  There were no noises coming from the objects, and no trailing aircraft.  I called two small local airports to see if they had any radar pings that matched my story, but the Mentor on the Lake airport said they didn’t have that type of equipment and the airport in Highland Heights said that it was handled through the large radars at the major area airports and that I’d have to contact them.",41.7059,-81.1997

Hello,  I witnessed something last night I cannot explain. I got home around 6:30 and decided to take a load off and chill on my deck. I wear prosthetic legs and those things really rub me raw sometimes. So I tossed them on the bed and quickly made my way to the deck to enjoy a beverage. I was sitting there relaxing when a storm began rolling in from the west. I figured I had few minutes before I had to drag myself back into the house, so I watched the clouds forming and lightning flashing in the distance, amazing stuff!  As the storm was about a mile off, I noticed a shiny object in the clouds, lit up by lightening. I thought it was a jet liner trying to get to CLT before it got diverted. Boy was I wrong!  The more I watched the more I realized it was not a plane. It would seemingly tele-port from one area to the next in and out of the storm, and then far away. Needless to say I was stunned, and I totally lost track of the time and the storm. Within minutes the storm was right on top of my house, and so was the silver object, which I can now see was a huge ball! I watched, helplessly as it danced in and out of the clouds seemingly feeding off the lighting. I was terrified more of the object than of being struck by lighting. I've watched enough shows on cable to know what happens next. 
 
 I could feel all the hairs on my arms and stumps standing up! But I wasn't sure if it was from the object or the storm! The thing was no farther than 300 ft from the top of my house at one point! It appeared to be about 100 feet in diameter and changed colors rapidly. Unbelievable! Of course this is the one time I left the phone on the kitchen table... 
 
 That is the last thing I remember doing last night after I saw that damn thing! I woke up today a bit disoriented, and sore.

We were sitting on the backporch after dinner.  Off to the south I see 3 red lights moving across the sky.  They form a triangle and flash in sequence.  At this point it is close enough to appear to be one craft, but if so is the size of a town.  It banks to the east and slowly heads away.  Speed wise it was moving about half of what the commercial jets in the area  appeared to be.  When I pointed it out to my friend his first statement was the same as mine ""what in the hell is that"".   
 
We quickly called the rest of our family from inside to come out.  No one had a clue what it could be.  I am still very curious. 
 
Hopefully someone else in the area saw something.

i quickly realize that its not a firework or a plane or even a satalight. i tell my 3 friends to look and we all watched as it slowly moved through the sky. we were all kinda like wtf is that?!?  it started to go over the tree line to where we could barely see it but it stoped right there and just dissapeard. it looked like a flame or a bright campfire, but with no defining shape.  i call it an orb. there was also a plane going right over while we were watching this orb, kinda weird to see a plane then that thing cruisen near it. well its cool theres this website to report this, and i see where someone else saw the same thing the same night in skys not far away.

We were vacationing on Tybee Island and had an ocean front condo.  My husband was on the balcony at approximately 11:00 PM.  I opened the sliding doors to the balcony to join him.  I saw as I opened the doors a large ball of white light that appeared to be hovering over the ocean near the water's edge.  I asked him what it was and he said he didn't know but had been watching it for a few mins.   
 
I moved to the left of the balcony to sit beside him and realized this object had no trailing light behind it.  We didn't believe it then to be a light from a ship and there was nothing notable on the water that we could see.  I hadn't been in my seat more than 3 seconds when it disappeared right in front of us.  I don't know which way it went because it went so quickly it left us really puzzled.  It didn't change colors but remained white the entire time before it was gone.   
 
We just sat there not saying anything for some seconds and then we started to speculate as to what in the world it could have been.   
 
My husband hadn't gotten up to come and get me because he was trying to figure out what it was, and he didn't want it to disappear if he made movement on the balcony.   
 
He then said that it was much bigger than we probably realized and appeared to him to be farther out than I thought it was.  Its light was cast on the water underneath of it.  I especially wanted to ask my husband if he had seen any beam of light behind it and he hadn't.  He said it was solitary...just hovering there over the water.   
 
This particular night I didn't see anyone on the beach and usually there were people walking with flashlights all through the night on that beach.  I have no idea if anyone else saw it.  I tried to remember if I had reported it here on this  site before but couldn't so I decided to report it just in case.  Needless to say I didn't sleep well at all the remaining nights.  We never saw it again but unless it was some strange natural occurrence we just happened to witness and know nothing about then it was indeed unidentified! by us.

On the night of Sept 4th, 2013 in Waxhaw, NC my husband rushed into the house from the garage telling me to come and take a look at something.  Once outside the front of our house he pointed to the sky and said "" I just saw a big ball of light fly across the sky and there are still two more hovering there.""  I looked and sure enough, there were two shimmering orbs and above those was a very bright colorful star.  The two orbs were reddish orange in color and were very bright.  They were right above the tree line on the horizon (one on top of the other), I estimate maybe around 20 miles away or closer.  I kept on comparing them to what I thought was this superbright ""star"" above both of them and was just in awe of how these orbs could be stationary, yet about 5 times bigger than this star and bright reddish orange. 
 
 Then slowly, the orb on the bottom of everything closet to the tree line started moving to the right (west)very quickly and was blinking blue and red.  If I hadn't just watched it be a big stationary orb for about 5 minutes, I would have thought it was a plane. 
 
 At this point my husband asked me to go inside because people would think we were crazy and we should just forget about it. So, I went inside, but of course had to check to see if there was anything in sky behind our house.  As I walked out the backdoor and got beyond our back porch there's a silent (I'm sure military) helicopter just above our house headed southwest towards where I saw the orb headed.  There were lights (regular spot light type lights) on the bottom of the helicopter and I could see the ""feet"" that the helicopter lands with, but couldn't hear a thing! Just a slight wooshing of air and that was it. I was amazed and ran inside to get my husband out of the garage to come and see-  In the approximately 5 seconds it took for us both to get outside in the back yard the helicopter was totally gone. 
 
 We stayed outside for about two minutes just talking about everything that was going on and all of the sudden above our heads there was an aircraft with a large orange/red triangle on the bottom, (the craft was about the size and shape of a really weird plane), a second mini triangle on the back of what looked like a tail end, and very ""plane like"" red and blue flashes on what we assume was the ""wing"" tips on each side of the large triangle. It was headed to the east. The opposite direction of where the helicopter was going. 
 
 We were really shocked and stood in the backyard talking about what could possibly going on... There are military drills around here a lot, so maybe this was a military drill? Maybe the military has developed orb and triangle lighted planes? We are on the brink of war with Syria, so who knows...  So then after about 4-5 minutes we go back to the front of the house. 
 
 Now there are ""heat lightning flashes"" to the east (I saw about 4) and the 2nd orb is moving straight upwards. Just going straight up in a line pretty slowly.  Then, it flashed and disappeared for a second, reappeared, and quickly moved west blinking like an airplane just like the other one did. 
 
 I went back inside to call it a night; I clearly knew we weren't going to find out what these things were.  My husband stayed outside.  About 10 minutes later he comes running in the house telling me to come outside. I go outside and he tells me about a super fast white streak that blazed across the sky east to west, but it was now gone. 
 
 ALSO GONE IS THE HUGE STAR FROM EARLIER!! So, what I thought was a super bright star or planet that was having a good day, was not that at all. No more heat lightning either, everything was now totally calm and normal. What was all this?",34.9251,-80.7278

At first look, it appeared as a brightly lit planet (Jupiter) during ideal viewing conditions. It was rather large (very noticeable) and it resembled the brightness of a planet but the sky wasn’t quite dark enough to see such brightness from a planet and its location ruled out the possibility for it to be a planet. I grabbed my binoculars and was astonished to see upon focusing, that the single bright light I saw actually appeared as 4 large yellow lights with flashing red lights in between.  It remained stationary as I observed and then the lights changed to a vertical or north south position and the flashing red lights disappeared while the four yellow lights I had initially seen changed to 5 or 6 solid yellow lights (I was unable to confirm 5 or 6 because it start! ed moving off to the right in this position and faded out of my view.) No sound could be heard (such that would be associated with an airplane.) Reflecting back, the whole viewing lasted (given that I had time to get up and take my binoculars from their case and adjust them) about 2-3minutes.

I was shooting Lightning In super slow motion (high speed camera) and got a surprise when I played it back at 32X slower than normal.  I made still frames at various points in the video as explained below, and will release the video at the proper time.  The single object appears to be cylinder shaped, but also looks to be tumbling/or shape changing, but I think tumbling.  When looking at the stills and video, it must be remembered that it was shot at 32X slower than normal.  Due to the high frame rate, it will appear to be going at normal speed.  I refer to it as a “perceptual” speed, that is what the mind perceives it when viewing. Very important to remember that the video is 32 times SLOWER than normal. 
 
It is the small brown dot/cylinder in the sky moving through the lightning event. 
 
No other aircraft were visible during storm. It was a strong lightning storm, and aircraft avoid those. 
 
 There are trees in the lower foreground. Due to High speed capture, they move 32 slower than normal. 
 
 I'll give you a little info on the stills. They are numbered by frame.. The 1st frame is 11:02 (11 sec, 2 frames).. In the video it drops from the top of screen and makes a turn into the lightning, passes THRU lightning, (12:21 is inside plasma, you can see the faint dot) and exits to the left (17:09)  These photos you are getting are compressed for web transfer. The originals and video are better quality and more clear. 
 
 The video was shot in 960 frames a second, slow motion. Normal Video speed is 30 frames a second. I was shooting a lightning storm facing due north to see what lightning looked like in super slow motion. The Lightning event I captured took ½ second to happen. When the camera shot it, it captured at 960 frames a second, there by, the playback of the lightning is 16 seconds. When I played back the video, I saw the object. The object appears at the top of the screen dropping down and making a curve turn of approx. 85 degrees and heads to the west. I was shooting the video over the top of some trees, at about a 45-degree angle, to at least a mile in the sky. 
 
 The object takes 7 seconds to travel across the screen. If the video was in real time (perceptual speed) it would be going as fast or faster than a jumbo jet (380-600 mph) and is a mile away (due to the 5 second delay of thunder 1000 ft. sec x 5 = 1mile approx.). If perceptual speed is @ 500 mph, then real time is 16,000 mph. The camera shoots at 960 frames = 32 x slower. If the object was only 100 mph perceptual, then it would be 3200 mph. I observe passenger jets daily (airport close by) and they travel slower then this object if the object was traveling the same perceptual. (if I didn't shoot in slow mo. and the object moved the same in vid as if you were standing and observing)  The lightning event occurred in 1/2 sec real time, slowed down to 32 times slower, 16 seconds to play out the entire lightning event. the object takes @ 7 seconds to travel screen. That means the object traveled the distance in .223 of a second. That is fast. You would never ever see this with your naked eye. I have not calculated the distance traveled by the object yet, and am working on that.",26.6598,-80.2429

We used to live in Lake Worth florida, (small downtown area in so fla) in a small high rise (6 stories) looking north towards the city of west palm beach, we were the hightest thing from Lake Worth to the city so we had an amazing view. we lived there for over 3 years and would constantly look north to the city lights. PBIA is also visible and we would see the planes coming in and out, after 3 years we would notice if flight patterns would change etc. 
 
On the evening of February 3rd 2012, I was in the kitchen (which looks directly out towards the big patio window) when I saw a HUGE orange orb fireball object heading south. There was no sound, in fact, you can see on my video how loud the music and everything was but planes regularly would drown out all the downtown noise. Given how many people were in the bars and on the street I couldnt believe I was the only one to see it. By the time I was able to get my phone to record, I had been observing the object for about a minute. The fireball/ orb got first was growing in size as it approached us then got smaller as it headed south, at one point I tried to rationalize it by thinking it was a natural occurrence but the sky was clear and there werent any storms or electricity in the air. In the video you can see it start to ascend and then almost disappear. It never fully went away, i was tracking it the whole time but seemed to change and blend in with the night sky. I even ques! tioned the object at one point bc it looked like a far off shuttle launch (being from so fla we can occasionally see a night launch) it eventually gained speed and began to glow brighter again. after where my video cuts off  the object continued to head up and ascend till it was parallel and blended in with the stars, at which point it hovered and changed color to match the stars (a sort of blueish color) After another 5 min of observing it in the same position i headed back in. 
 
 The video captured was with my iphone that was almost dead and completely full of data at the time. so when i went to stop the video my phone was off and after I rebooted it, the video was not stored. I was pretty upset that it didnt work but about 2 days later, the video showed up in my queue (but at only a fraction of the recording was actually saved)",26.60736336,-80.12623783

Date: 12/9/14 at 230am EST  Location:  Morgantown, WV.  	It was around 230 am EST, I walked to and opened my sliding glass doors on the bottom floor of our house, facing the South West direction.  This is where I smoke, since my wife is pregnant, and I don’t want a smoke filled house.  It is also very common for me to wake and smoke throughout the night.  I proceeded to light my cigarette and was on my smart phone, when I looked up and saw it.  I have a short backyard, about 15 ft, and then it slopes upward at a 45 degree angle for approximately 40 ft, to a road with a newly built vacant house on the other side of the road.  This house always has the outside light on. 
 
	At the top of the hill (in front of the road and vacant house), there was a black box looking mass approximately 8ft long and 6ft tall.  Next to this there was the being, which looked like a classic grey, 4-5ft tall, but long skinny arms.  The being had one arm on the mass as if to be leaning or bracing itself on it.  The being was clear to see due to the light of the vacant house shining behind it (Directly).   
 
This lasted for only 2-3 seconds, as my mind processed what I was looking at, and then my animalistic fear rushed over me like I have never felt before.  I had the immediate feeling the being wanted me to see it, since it was standing directly in front of the vacant house light for me to see.   
 
But when fear and panic shot through my body it quickly darted either into, or behind the black mass (as if it could sense my fear of it).  It moved quit strangely, almost like a sliding mechanical way, smooth, quick, graceful and without a sound.  I have never seen anything living move like this before, which elevated my fear more.

We were slowing down to turn into the outlet and a yellowish-orange circle appeared over the ocean.  It was very bright considering how far away the object was.  I told my wife ""LOOK!""  She looked up and said ""what in the world is that?""  After the first object appeared, it went from a brightness of 10 to 0.  Next, to the left of where the first object was - another one appeared in the same fashion.  So, from right to left we saw this occurrence 5 times. Just before one object would fade, another one would appear.  At all times, you could see one object dimming and the other getting brighter.  There was considerable distance between the object locations.  We could not hear any sounds or anything of that nature.  This was extremely odd.  This was not an airplane with blinking lights or anything.  If you ever get the opportunity to see this, you ! will understand what I mean.  We were probably 2 or 3 miles from the ocean.  This object appeared to be a great distance from us.  The location of these objects were well over the tree horizon.  I would say if you were looking at the tree line, this would have been 30 degrees above that. 
 
 I can honestly say that my wife no longer thinks I am crazy.  I reported an incident last year about the circles in the sky in another county.  This time, I had a witness.  There is nothing to explain what we saw other than the text above.

At approximate 10:30 p.m. on Thursday, October 22, 2015 my roommate and I were talking out on our balcony which faces about south east.  I was sitting in a low chair and my roommate was standing with his back against the railing, facing me and the door to the apartment--he could not see the sky.  As we talked I observed a bright light moving across the sky that resembled the profile of a meteor, that is to say the light grew brighter as it moved laterally across the sky from the right of the balcony to the left.  That would put it coming from roughly the south to the north. If the light had streaked then disappeared I would have thought it to be just that, a meteor.  However, about 2 seconds after the light appeared the path of the light curved sharply upward and disappeared. The light did not fade out, it was there and then it wasn’t there. 
 
This was so strange that I stood up and told my roommate what I had seen.  There wasn’t much to say other than I had seen a light moving strangely in the sky. We joked that I was the only one to have seen it and that I now had a ‘UFO’ story that was unsubstantiated. It wasn’t two minutes later that he pointed up into the sky and yelled ‘look at that!’ I thought he was kidding around at first but as I looked three uniformly shaped lights in a delta formation moved rather swiftly and silently through the sky toward the place where I saw the first light curve upward.  From our point of view they came over the apartment building which would put them moving roughly east.  In the interim between the first light and the sighting of three lights we observed five or six passenger jets flying overhead which is common for this area.  These planes took about 30-40 seconds to cross the majority of the sky.  The lights we saw crossed about half of the visible sky in less than 4 seconds. 
 
As the lights receded from us, the back right light broke formation in a non-ballistic motion, curving through the sky much like a motorcycle zipping around traffic, and passed between the other two as all three accelerated and then disappeared.  Just like the first like the first light that I saw, they did not fade out.  They were simply there and then not there.  I had my cell phone in my hand while we watched, however I was so completely mystified by what we were seeing that by the time it occurred to me to try and film the lights had gone. It likely wouldn’t have shown up though, because once I had begun to take video most everything was black except for the brightly lit parking lot. 
 
 I don’t recall the shape of the first light very clearly. It didn’t really gain my full attention until it curved upward. The three lights however were very round, nearly perfect discs of soft white light. They appeared to be very high above us. I could not discern any detail other than the relative size and shape. There was no tell-tale warbling of jet engines nor any other sound to indicate a fast moving aircraft. 
 
 Shortly after our experience another roommate came home and after we told him what we saw, he indicated that he had seen a similar light in the sky akin to the first light that I saw. He was outside and less than 5 miles away to the north west of our apartment. He said that he noticed a bright light in his periphery and turned to look at it. As he did the light was obscured by the little cloud cover that was out. It was strange enough to him that he got the attention of another person next to him but as he directed their attention to the expected position in the sky, the light did not reappear. He did not witness the other three lights.

It was completely silent, very bright and would hover at times while following a very erratic, non-linear flight path. It zigged and zagged and eventually flew off after a few minutes.

I initially intended to check the outside temp on a thermometer attatched to my window screen.  It was 22° and very clear.  My attention was quickly diverted to the skyline above Greencastle pike.  Just above the tree line behind my house I noticed a very low flying object which basically looked liked a very bright ball of white light.  I couldn't make out any shape of the craft as the light was too bright.  It continued to fly very slowly in a southern direction towards Hagerstown's west end.  I just assumed it was a Cessna type plane flying low on a landing approach to the Hagerstown airport and I continued admiring the clear morning sky. 
 
As I'm scanning the sky and looking at what stars, I could see, I noticed two other passenger planes flying at different directions at a much higher altitude than the flying ball of bright light I first noticed.  Both of those planes displayed the blinking red lights that I'm familiar seeing. 
 
The sight of those higher flying planes made me realize that the plane that I thought was a Cessna wasn't displaying any red or blinking lights at all, just one massive light covering the entire craft.  I also realized that the ball of white light was actually flying towards the center of town, not to the airport as I originally thought because of it's low altitude and speed.  It was literally just ten or fifteen feet above the tree line that runs perpendicular to Greencastle pike and connects to the adjacent neighbourhood. 
 
When I gathered all my thoughts together and began to think that this thing may not be a private plane at all, I grabbed for my phone which was charging on the nightstand next to my bed with the intention to shoot some video.  As I raised the phone and fumbled with video mode and focus, the light disappeared as if someone turned off a light switch.  I didn't see a light trail that I would expect to see if the object had accelerated away at high speed, nor could I see a dark outline of an unlit object against the morning sky.  It's as if it were erassed with no trace of it ever being there in the first place. 
 
At this point I just froze in place. I didn't know how to feel or what to think. I was just numb trying to understand what in the world it was that I just witnessed.  Never in my 48 years have I seen anything in the sky that I couldn't explain. 
 
For the past few days in my spare time I've been driving around the area directly under where I observed the light trying to explain this off as something normal.  There are no high mountain roads for it to have been car headlights, and I believe the object behind the light was too big to be a civilian (toy) drone. 
 
This object was in my view for exactly 5 minutes.  It made no sound at all, never changed speed or color, and never diverted from its flight path before I lost sight of it.  As far as size is concerned, I'm guessing that it was equivalent to the size of a private Cessna style plane, but possible a little bigger.  The trees that I observed the object flying over are approximately 50-60 feet high, putting the height of the object in flight at about 75-100 feet. 
 
Lastly, I scanned the sky that Sunday morning in all directions until 7:20am, trying to relocate whatever it was that I witnessed.  I've also checked the same area of sky from 5:30am until 7am the following Monday and Tuesday mornings only to find nothing out of the ordinary.",39.6414,-77.72563146

These were only visible for a few seconds but while they were they were positioned about adjacent or some what near each other.

I am a pilot and aircraft owner.  I had to go to Tennessee on Wednesday for a service call for work.

About 20 minutes into the flight, I was over Liberty Reservoir, headed toward Frederick, a couple of minutes before sunrise, and I saw two white lights hanging in the sky in the distance directly in front of me.

I am aware the eye sometimes plays tricks on us, when it comes to airliners; sometimes they seem to be just floating in the air, while they're actually flying typically between 180 knots and 240 knots inbound or outbound.

I said no and why.  He proceeded to tell me that his brother saw what I saw this morning. (3/12/11). and he can't find him.  
 
He thought he may be over to my house telling me what he saw.  I drove over to my neighbor's house that morning to find out what was going on.  Only thing he knew was his brother was awaken my his dog and he let his dog outside that morning thing that he had to do his business.  His dog ran back back in and got under the bed.  His brother went outside and seen nothing but felt his hair stand up on his neck.   
 
He went back in and came back out and look around and saw it. Interesting enough as he was telling me what his brother was telling me, I explained that my dog at 4:00 - 4:15 started barking wildly as though there was an intruder in the house.   
 
I jumped out of the bed and found nothing.  I didn't go outside at the time.  I went back to bed.   Around 5:00 am, she woke me up  this time I went let her out to do her business.  This time I went out with her and looked around but I didn't see anything.   
 
Later that day, I got a chance to speak to my neighbor's brother and he explained to me what he saw.  HE didn't describe the object only to say it was larger and it was coming from my direction and moving just above the tree tops with no sound.  It was pitch black outside but he was able to make out how larger this object was.  It was large. The size of a cloud and just above the tree top floating with no sound.   
 
He said he froze and watched this object glide and turn the same time as it continued to move just above the tree tops heading west north.  Than it started to shimmer as if it was being bath in water and it disappeared.   
 
I've being in touch with my neighbor since than wanting to talk to his brother and he tells me that he told his brother that I want to talk to him again since his sighting knowing t hat after a couple of days he would remember more of what he saw.  My neigbor told me that his brother won't even talk on it and he said that which I do remember him telling me the same and that is if we tell other people and they come and ask him about it he will denied it.   
 
My neighbor also told me that his brother is different ever since he saw this.  I explained to both my neighbor and his brother that what ever is going on in the Pigeon Hills it will be back.

Tic-Tac, cigar-shaped. Several lights I could make out, mostly red. The craft appeared to be stationary for the duration of the 40 minutes until it disappeared out of my line of sight. No propulsion, completely silent. The most bizarre was seeing it in the same location as last time I witnessed it a few weeks prior. Definitely not a helicopter or a plane, especially having seen so many in the Big Flats Airport region. I don't believe it was a drone, also due to the fact that in the last five to ten minutes, it seemed like it was moving side-to-side. Wingless,no propulsion and silent from what I gathered. Second time I've seen it over the Elmira neighborhoods in July. The most striking was the changing of lights, almost like a star, but it wasn't high enough to be considere! d one.

After about 30 seconds of me staring at it with my jaw to the floor in complete awe, a military fighter jet, likely a newer F35 from pax river research base flew over my house, towards the direction of the blue orb, with the jets direction offset to the west of the object by 10 degrees or so, at a very unusually slow speed that made it extremely quiet and at a very unusually low altitude.  I see fighter planes around my house all the time, for my entire life and I have never seen a fighter plane fly at such a slow speed or such a low altitude with such a quiet dynamic.   
 
After a minute or two, the pulse began to change its tempo, when the plane came closer to it, though its hard to tell exactly how far away from it, the blue orb light compressed to a small white light.  As the fighter plane got a mile or two past my house, and closer to the direction of the 'orb' the light compressed from blue into white and then a thin orange spike that looked like a meteorite trail that ex! tended upwards and began from the point of the light which then disappeared.  The orange trail was very small and very feint, perhaps the size of a needle in the sky with a tail length about as wide as my thumb or a degree or two. 
 
This object was completely stationary in the sky and did not move until it began to disappear and was not on an orbit what so ever.  I would estimate it was any where from a quarter mile to a mile or so in the sky. 
 
I have contacted multiple flight facilities, looking for any activity from experiments, but this was not a sounding rocket, or an experiment, or a satellite burning up in the atmosphere.  It was completely stationary.  I have studied ball lightning and I can assure that not only was this not ball lightning, but the atmospheric dynamics at the time was not conducive to ball lightning.  This was not anywhere near the altitude of an elfing event nor was this a 'blue sprite'.  The brightness magnitude during the peak of the pulses was around 2 times the brightness of Rigel and barely visible at the low magnitude of the pulses which were at patterns of about a second or two and changed over the minute or two I observed the blue orb. The glow did not give off diffraction spikes like stars and was a smooth glowing blue orb which had smooth gradients of pulses.  The image shape was diamond orb like and gave off a rounded square edged shape at the height of its brightness in pulse.  The speed in which it disappeared was very quickly at around a half a second or less once it became a smaller bright white light.  I observed the object for around 1 or 2 minutes until it disappeared when the jet appraoched it. 
 
I have added photos of a sighting from Puerto Rico in 2017 I found after the event that accurately resemble the shape and dynamics as the orb had a 2 part-like dynamic to it during its pulses with a mild middle dividing line, that made the orb look a bit like two bubbles stuck together.  These are extremely accurate photos to the agreement of what i saw to the point where i believe this is exactly what i saw.   
 
I contacted flight facility of Wallops and searched for flight or experiment anomolies but found no satellites or sounding rockets that could represent these dynamics or color wavelenghts.",38.6955,-76.6061

After about ten minutes the middle light started flickering faster and faster until it fell a short distance then disappeared. I continued watching and after about 5 minutes after the middle light vanished the upper most light began flashing and fell.

I looked to my right and i seen two red lights in the sky much bigger and closer then the first time.  The red lights were moving away from the fireworks going towards their original spot.  The lights were moving horizontally and in a strange fashion.  The one in front would move a bit then stop as the one behind would move the same amount before stopping and the front one move again. 
 
The movement was much like that of an inch worm.  Once the lights arrived back at the place where i first seen them they stopped and just hovered untill they gradually faded away.

My girlfriend and I were taking our dogs out to use the bathroom when we noticed a couple of strange things in the sky. There were 2 medium sized bright white lights sitting in low points in the sky, multiple (at least 4) very small red flashing lights that would fly around those points (one shooting straight up into the sky very fast, one circled around one of those points, one shot to the right and we could not see it anymore, and the other one randomly flying beside the points)  There was one considerably bigger bright light that would flash from white to red to blue. That one was in the shape of a V, the others were too small to tell but if I had to guess I would say they were circular. The V shaped object would orbit and would sit in this one point in the sky while randomly moving either side to side or up and down. It would be still, then move side to side, then be still, then move again, and so on and so forth. 
 
 We sat and watched this for a little over an hour until going inside. There were stars out, however those were definitely not stars considering they moved. We are unsure if perhaps they are some sort of low flying government sattelites or possibly UFO's. 
 
 Definitely going to check again tonight and will report again if we see anything, we also took a 3 minute video of it. The weird part is that in the video it seems farther than it was when we were looking at it and the colors seem more apparent.

preface: No, this is not my idea of a joke to waste your time. I have held onto this experience for years and have told only few close friends out of fear of being judged. I am probably going to immediately discredit myself by saying this but at the time I had taken about 100 ug of LSD. I feel like this is very important for me to mention even though I am probably about to be discredited because I have a very big sense that I was ""picked out"" that night for ""research"" because of doing it. This was not my first time doing it, and even though the experience horrified me it was not my last because I wanted to see if my brain would ever ""go there"" again and It hasn't. I am very clearly able to separate the hallucinations from whatever happened to me that night. 
 
The night started at my dad's house. I had just started tripping on the acid I had eaten roughly a half hour before and my girlfriend thought it would be best to move me to her friend's house because I was laughing too hard and we didn't want my dad to question my state of mind. I agree and she drives me to her friend's house on the other side of my neighborhood. Once we both arrive the night played out as normal as it could have for the situation for about two hours. I had brought a dab pen with me and remember all of us sharing that watching to wong foo (or lsd's version of it where time stops and its just a single drag queen frowning in a car staring at you soullessly for an hour(don't do drugs, kids.)) about halfway (at least I think) through the movie I don't know how or why but I go from laying on the bed, to standing in the middle of the staircase with nobody around me. I had been entirely teleported in the blink of an eye. I'm there for maybe five seconds before i'm shot into a different room downstairs in the house, and then eventually I am sucked up out the roof through the corner of the house (It felt like i was turned into gas and sucked through a tube, but I kept flipping and sticking to the sides of the wall like one of those sticky knick-knack guys you throw on the wall.) 
 
From here I am entirely enveloped by a soupy gold/yellow light that would switch from the gold/yellow glow to a more analogue orange glow. I can hear a part of myself say ""this is deeply wrong"" and I am then shot the image of a face right in front of mine. It was almost humanoid but it was entirely translucent and actually lacked a ""face."" no eyes, maybe some small indents to indicate a nose or mouth but it as very subtle if it had anything. The face would have horrified me if I saw it in a movie or dream but for whatever reason I stayed entirely calm. As a hospital frequenter (I break bones a lot) I could tell this was some sort of doctors office. the room was small like a patient first room and I could see about two or three more of these entities shuffling around in the background assisting. I was on an operating table of sorts made entirely out of the same light I was enveloped in before. Somehow from here I am able to see the back of my own head and skull outside my body only It doesn't look like my head at all. The only way I could tell it belonged to me is because I saw them start digging a scalpel into the back of the skull and immediately felt the most release of pressure I have felt in my entire life. This was indescribably the most satisfying feeling I have felt in my whole Life and I don't even know what they did. It felt like they had sent a charge of white light through my brain only to remove more white light, like they had purified something. In this state I am sent back into the enveloping light and hear myself once again say ""this is deeply wrong."" I am immediately transported back to my body, sitting in perfect full lotus pose with my right foot sitting up top. As soon as I look at my right foot I notice a giant white blister on my toe that wasn't there immediately before the experience. I noticed the blister had the same white almost translucent color that the entity from the operating room had. it disappeared within a few days but I couldn't help but worry that contact with the being or the craft I was inside of had exposed me to some kind of radiation/etc. Again, I understand that this will probably be discredited because of my aforementioned illicit drug use but again I strongly feel that I was chosen to be studied/met with at all because of the open state that it allowed me to be in at that time, or to make the story easily discredited (like that one Simpsons episode where Homer got abducted but the aliens drenched him in whiskey so nobody would believe him.) (Again I swear on my mother's life this isn't joke or a made up story.)

Exact longitude and latitude at time of sighting: 36.854750, -75.969278. 
 
 I was deep-sea fishing on a commercial boat off the coast of Virginia Beach in 2019. Things are - granted - fuzzy, as I was on some decently strong psychotropic medication at the time. Luckily, I had the foresight to snap a picture, which jogged my memory wholly in the recent days - being swept up by the UAP information being released. The incident stuck out in my mind due to recent news revealing that there's been a significant amount of sightings over the ocean. 
 
 When I say was fuzzy I do mean it. I was out on the boat for maybe anywhere from one to two hours, and I had downloaded some podcasts to listen to while out fishing. It felt as though in one moment there was nothing - and the next moment I looked up, there was an oddly vertical craft almost hovering above the water. The craft didn't seem to move strongly in any direction, almost hanging perfectly still directly in the center of my vision. As I mentioned before, I had the foresight to snap a photo. Just about everything around the photo is useful - except for the damn image itself. What was incredibly apparent was that the object was very large and decently far away. It was a clear as clear could be on that day, however, so there was absolutely zero mistaking it. The craft appears very blurry in the image, however, there's relevant detail that was automatically stored when I had taken the image due to the Google Photos app's data storage. 
 
 https://ibb.co/VWnNw16 --- Here is a link to the image, you can check it on whatever site you'd want, ibb is a site I use personally. 
 
 The shape of the object was hard to pin down. I've tried doing some googling for similar images in the recent weeks and there's only one I seem to keep coming back to for the most accurate comparison of what I saw in the sky. 
 
 https://ibb.co/dQPp7sw  Imagine if that craft was rotated ~45 degrees or so on its z axis. That's the closest thing I could describe it to. A pointy, vertically-oriented black craft hovering in the sky. Even in my haze, I had mentally ruled out the possibilities of it being a singular bird (too big) or a helicopter (no visible rotors or obvious means of propulsion). Do with this info what you will - as a rule of thumb I'm not particularly interested in any sort of publicity, even though you may do with the info what you see fit to. I was not particularly interested in showing it to anyone at the time out of fear of stigmatization and am still not very interested in having my name attached to it. The fact of the matter is, however, that this incident has stuck with me for years - and it should be seen by someone given the recent breakthroughs and some amateur research done by me that has pinned Virginia Beach as a ""ufo hotspot"" in recent years.

As we continued to drive under it we were still amazed by what we saw we passed it by like 100 feet but could still see it hovering in the same spot so I told my friend that was driving to turn around so we could get physical evidence of it like a photo or video and as he commenced making the U turn, it saw us, because in like 1-2 seconds it flew over a hillside like 2 miles away.. nothing man made can cover that distance in that amount of time that's when I knew without a doubt what I just seen.

At 8:44 on the dot...every night since March 5.  MUFON says this is impossible. 
 
The first of four appear directly over the City Of Reading, PA.  It is NOT VENUS. It is BIG and BRIGHT looking, through binoculars, like a kryptonite headlight.  When it first appears it sometimes looks like a white circle with light beams coming off it. 
 
It goes through about 20 minutes of ""development"" during which time it becomes larger, brighter and drops lower in altitude.  During this time, also, it develops a metallic protrusion at the five o'clock position...we often refer to it here as the ((deleted)). 
 
Around 9:30 the second, third and fourth appear very high in the sky and much farther out.  They clearly come from the same factory.  We now call them JFV1, 2 3 and 4 in honor of John Forester, the Managing Editor of The Reading Eagle who continues to insist #1 is Venus. 
 
The biggest, closest and brightest (JFV1) then goes through his nightly routine of travelling a semi-circle over and away from the city getting so low the camera is well-below the LEVEL point.  Throughout his routine, he is approached by INTRUDERS that look just like stereotypical flying saucers and the like. These are not visible to the naked eye but are captured quite well by 14mp and 900mm Pentax SMC lens. 
 
The INTRUDERS seem to use JFV1 as if it were a New Jersey Traffic Circle.  Sometimes they seem to be in conflict.  JFV1 often contorts into ugly shapes when they are moving too fast or too close...very weird but they are definitely communicating. 
 
STRANGE PHYSICS...When taken out-of-focus JFV1 becomes OTHER clear and IN-FOCUS OBJECTS usually in the form of a nonagon.  Surfaces of the nonagon can be presented looking like a bucket of garbage or even the scene of PA countryside from an airplane.  ALSO when in the nonagon aspect NOTHING ELSE is visible in the sky.

We were hanging out on the back deck of my friend's house just watching the stars. There's little to no light pollution in that area as it's out in the country, so you can see the sky very well. Anyway, it was a clear night that night and we were just enjoying how beautiful the sky looked that night. I turned my gaze towards the sky just above the house and I saw something that sorta looked like a fast-moving contrail that was in 2 lines heading west and just disappearing before going out of sight. It's really hard to describe because it was much lighter than the usual contrail and it looked like something I saw in Colorado Springs a few years ago, but with a completely different shape. It made no sound and it was only there for like 3 seconds before it disappeared. My friends did not see it because they were talking to each other and weren't looking up. I asked them if they saw it too and they both said that they didn't. I'm not sure of the exact time, but it was between 11:30pm and midnight. 
 
Interestingly enough, about 2 weeks before I went out there, my friend sent me a picture of something really strange and asked me what it was. I told her that I had no idea but that it looked like she caught a UFO and maybe a portal. She said that she was trying to take a picture of the moon that was between some tall trees in her back yard at 12:33am, but caught something much more interesting instead.

On Friday, February 14th, 2014, my girlfriend and I were returning from dinner and as we entered Route 30 bypass westbound we noticed 8-10 objects flying on the other side of the road, what looked like a few hundred feet up.  Since I was driving the time I had to focus on the objects was limited but was still long enough to notice that this was not a normal occurrence. 
 
The objects were emitting a red light, which at first made us think of the lights on top of radio towers.  As we began moving past them on the bypass we noticed that they were not stationary, and in fact were moving east or northeast.  It also became clear that this was not normal due to the close proximity of the lights to one another.  It seemed as if they were moving in almost a V-shaped pattern although it was not clear. 
 
Another piece of information that helped prove that we were not just seeing things was the fact that on the eastbound lane of the bypass there were a few cars stopped and with people out with their phones capturing the same thing we had just passed.  At that point though we determined that it would be best to get home and check sources for any possible information on the siting.

From our back porch, through a clear, unobstructed opening in the trees that faces north northeast I saw a tight cluster of approximately 50 or more (difficult to count) blinking orange to reddish lights. They were in a loose cluster formation traveling east to west, much slower than an airplane and without any sound.  The sky was clear to the north with high, thin clouds coming in from the south.  The lights were below the clouds but appeared very high. There were also lights from a plane traveling north, above the clouds and above the cluster, but from my viewpoint ‘through’ the cluster. The wind was light and the direction the lights were moving seemed to contradict the wind and the cloud movement. I know winds can vary with altitude, and I do not know how high these lights were flying. Having seen a fireball recently, I stopped to consider what I was seeing and realized it was not fireball, fireworks or anything else that I’d ever seen before.  I watched th! em for several seconds, thinking they would quickly vanish, and when they didn’t, I called my wife and asked her to bring the camera.  There is over 5 minutes of video that document most of what we saw. 
 
 What they looked like to me were electrically generated lights, not flame, pulsing from a very bright orange to a not so bright red and back again. No way was it flame! They pulsed at about 1 second intervals, not in unison. The lights were moving at about the same speed and direction with some slight variation. There seemed to be two types – one type was definitely brighter than the other type. 
 
 I went inside to get the phone to call our neighbor but stopped, grabbed my binoculars instead and returned when my wife said the lights were disappearing. The way they were disappearing was just to kind of fade out. No loss in altitude. Each one just fizzling out where it stood, bunches at a time until the only ones that were left were a handful of the brighter ones. As those last ones diminished, a few more of the brighter type drifted into view from the east. The position of our house and a large holly tree prevented us from seeing where they originated, they just drifted into our small field of view and every single one of them vanished within our sight after crossing our small field of view.  A couple at a time, then one at a time, with longer spaces in between, and then they were done. The last one seemed to change direction after crossing the opening in the sky. It seemed to move further away to the north before vanishing. 
 
 When I tried looking at them with my binoculars and it appeared that the orange light was coming from the bottom of the object and the red light was coming from the top. It also appeared that they went a little faster when the red light was glowing, and slower when the orange light was glowing, though that could have been an illusion. I’d like to think this could be explained as being Chinese lanterns or something of the sort, but the intensity of the electric light, their height, the fact that they remained in a such tight formation, and that they vanished so simultaneously, make it difficult to explain. 
 
 I’ve lived my entire 50+ years under the flight path of Philadelphia International Airport. I’ve worked outdoors all my life. I intentionally spend a lot of my leisure time looking at the sky, day and night, and enjoying the variety of light displays, natural and manmade.  This is a very urban area and it’s not uncommon to see distant fireworks or balloons from a party.

After returning home late, I had gone upstairs but had not turned on my light when I looked out the window to see something that initially looked like a large planet low hung in the sky over the mountain behind our house, but I noticed the distinct flashing of red, blue, and green lights.  I watched the object for a few minutes when suddenly it began to move.  It hovered, then randomly moved diagonally, up, down, sideways, only stopping when two other aircraft entered the vicinity.  After the aircraft left the airspace, it began moving again.  Also, I noticed that there was a halo around the object and trail when it moved, even though it was a clear night.  The treetops beneath it also seemed to be lighting up as if random beams of light were scanning the woods beneath the object.  I looked at the object with binoculars and saw a bright red flashing center surrounded by intermittent blue and green lights in a circular pattern. After watching it for a half an! hour, I decided to turn on the light to get ready for bed.  I turned the light off and looked out to see that the object had sunk down below the tree line, then disappeared.  It made no noise that I could perceive.

Characteristics: There were lights on the object, The object changed color","I saw multiple unidentified lighted Objects in the sky. 
 
I was driving in the town of New Lisbon, NJ, heading towards Browns Mills, NJ.  I was about to turn right onto Junction RD, when I saw several good sized lights to straight ahead of me. 
 
I knew instantly from the size and number of them (6-8 or so)that they were not something you see every day.  I decided not to make the right onto Junction Rd, and quickly went straight ahead out to the next Rd (Pemberton- Browns Mills RD) to see if I could get a better view of them.  I sped and got to the next road over in about 20 seconds. 
 
When I came to the stop sign, I parked and got out.  I could see them objects still, but they were going behind the tree line and out of my view.  I got my cell phone out as fast as I could, and started to film.  I was a bit nervous, and it took me a few seconds to get the camera video going.  By this time, most had gone behind the tree line.  One was still very much in the open, and I decided to film that one.  For anybody that is Familiar with this area, it was over the Pemberton Twp Police Department building along the woods line, but was further back not close to Pemberton Browns Mills Rd. I could not judge the distance, but guessed it was out near Pointsville RD on Fort Dix somewhere near Emmons Dairy, a well known Farm in my area. 
 
It took me a few seconds to find the object with my phone. They were lights, I didn’t see any shape of the object itself.  They seemed to flicker a bit almost to a light blue color.  There was no sound at all while I recorded, other than the sound of passing cars in front of me.  I recorded for about 30 seconds, until I became aware, I was standing in the middle of a road, and then looked around to make sure no cars were coming behind me.  The object also got behind the tree line. 
 
All along, these objects were in some sort of formation or pattern, not just randomly in the sky.  Upon playing back my video, I saw it came out shaky, but I did catch the object, although it appeared smaller on the video than it did with my own eye.  I don’t know how to zoom with my camera on my phone, or perhaps the video would be better.  Other objects in the video include a street light and cars passing by horizontally in front of me. The object itself, seems to move quickly back and forth within a small area.  I don’t think this was due to my shaking hand, but I don’t know for sure. 
 
Again, the best spot I estimate the objects to have been flying directly over would be in the area of Pointsville Rd between Pemberton & Fort Dix Military Base. 
 
 Living in the area of Fort Dix & McGuire AFB my whol life, I am used to seeing and hearing planes & helicopters.  These were no planes as they floated way too slowly.  They may have been stealth choppers possibly, but that's the only thing I could imagine them being.  They floated with a purpose, and in a formation of some sort, all moving together in one direction towards Fort Dix and McGuire AFB.",39.9701,-74.6625

Yesterday at approximately 4:40 pm I was traveling northwards on Interstate 287 in Morris County, New Jersey.

I must have been approaching mile marker 50, when a bright light appeared in the storm clouds directly ahead of me, brightening––for a moment––the clouds immediately surrounding its source. 
 
The source of the light soon emerged from the cloud covering: it was a glowing orb which I saw descending  to earth in a straight path. Within seconds, it had disappeared from view behind a hill.  By my estimate, it must have made impact no more than a mile from my vehicle. Numerous others must have witnessed the event as well, as the highway was heavily trafficked.

While spending Memorial day weekend in the Long Island/NYC area, I visited the USS Intrepid Sea, Air, and Space Museum.  The day was Sunday, May 25th, 2014.   
 
After touring the top deck and interior I made my way down the stairs to the adjacent dock area.  There were already multiple news and tour helicopters making their way up the Hudson River, while a US Coast Guard MH-65 was performing a Search and Rescue Demo (for NY Fleet Week) over the waterfront so naturally I had my eyes towards the sky, at just after noon (anywhere between 12:00 and 12:30) I noticed a small object at high altitude over the Hudson.   
 
At first I suspected it to be merely a balloon, however after examining the object for a few seconds I noticed it appeared to be considerably larger than a normal balloon and it was hovering in place as if not affected by the present winds which a balloon would be.  Its coloration was also interesting, it appeared to mostly be a metallic grey or silver on the! surface.  
 
I pointed it out to my father who quickly dismissed it as probably being a balloon (although he said he couldn't see it very well).  I began snapping photos of the object with my IPhone 5. I estimated the objects altitude to be around 4,000-5,000 feet because it was a lot higher than the helicopters flying up the Hudson but much lower than the occasional passing commercial airliner out of JFK airport, I had no way of guessing the objects size due to its distance and lack of anything close enough to it to compare it with, though it did appear to be larger than a balloon.   
 
After a few minutes the object began a slow flight path moving diagonally but remaining at the same altitude, I began backing up to keep the object in view while taking pictures but it soon passed over the deck of the Intrepid and out of sight.  Although I didn't run into any other witnesses I think it is unlikely that I was the only one who saw it due to the sheer number of people in the area.   
 
Upon uploading and reviewing the photos on my computer the following day, I noticed several things that I didn't notice while viewing the object,  The first few pictures showed exactly what I saw, a small rounded shiny metallic object hovering.  However, as I looked through the pictures I noticed the object had a darker, shaded edge in some pictures giving it more of a definitive shape (this may have been due to the sun reflecting from the other side of the object) while in other photos the object appeared to be very bright and shiny.  One of the photos the object is completely dark except for a small ring of light in the center that appears to be generated by the object, the rest of the object appears much more like a structured craft here with less of a circular shape and two corners on one side.  
 
The final photos show the object again to be metallic and silver with the upper half being brighter (almost a whitish blue) and the lower half being a darker grey, there are also several dark patches on the edges of the object.  
 
I have always been intrigued by the UFO phenomenon but have mostly remained a skeptic however I am questioning it now.  All I can say is that while knowing a lot about aviation and can easily identify most airplanes or helicopters, this object I witnessed and photographed did not move like or resemble any normal aircraft that I have seen in my life.",40.75256378,-73.98445672

This morning the sky was blue.  Weather was nice.   
 
I looked up at the sky as I left the Costco Warehouse and noticed lots of chemtrails crisscrossing the beautiful blue sky.  As I was gazing up, I noticed a silver bullet shaped object hovering stationary way up in the sky to the right of Costco between 2nd & 3rd Avenue, around 35th Street.   
 
I looked down and back up and saw that the object was still there not moving.  It did not have any wings or propellers.  It was not a blimp.  No sound coming from it.  It was silent and silverbullet shaped and stationary high up.   
 
I took out my camera to try and photograph it, but my zoom was not working properly.  As I looked up again, I noticed a airplane heading towards its direction.  As the airplane got closer towards the object...the object (UFO) simple disappeared!  Vanished right before my eyes!

A few seconds later the clouds had left from in front of the moon, and the light flash appeared again, but in the same exact spot.

So my friend and I were in Inwood Hill Park, that's a park in Upper Manhattan almost crossing to the Bronx/Yonkers and we were just sitting, talking on a bench facing North. 
 
Now it was raining ALL DAY yesterday and it was drizzling a bit while we were there. 
 
Very cloudy..  Like gray sky..  You couldn't really distinguish one cloud.  There had been airplanes passing above and near us.  We could HEAR them but not SEE them because that's how cloudy it was. 
 
So anyway we were sitting there and we saw a BRIGHT green neon light orb looking about hmm a mile away.  It was hovering and then switched to a bright red/white light and then back to green. 
 
It was a constant green light.  It was NOT flashing.  The only time it flashed was when it was red/white for like 4 seconds.  The light was moving really fast towards us. 
 
(South) and then it went back really quickly and then it was moving downwards really fast and then to the sides..  THIS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN AN AIRPLANE or a JET or helicopter.. the angles it was moving in were crazy.  Kinda like zig zags. 
 
& then it vanished into thin air. 
 
This happen last night.. at about 12:30 am.

Up to seven appeared in the sky at the same time, all hovering around each other in formations, while not seeming to be moving in any one particular predetermined direction.

When from right to left, something as bright as the planets, moves across dark sky. 
 
Bright “round-ish” light, no form to say, very far away, moving quickly from my right to left. 
 
I am amazed, just looking at it.  My girls comes outside, I rolled down passenger window and told her to look.  She said, ""Yes yes, stars are nice.""  I asked do you see the moving one… Holy ((deleted))! She saw same as me.  We both looked in amazement. 
 
I had about a minute view before she exited our home, and about a minute together looking before we had to go to the train. 
 
The object moved from my right to left in the sky, it did look like it had an arch kind of path, not sure to explain, but did not look like a straight line. 
 
We live near airports and highways, flight path is right over us and helio's are always around.  I know what they look and sound like, and are much closer than what I saw, even at high altitude. 
 
What I saw was no plane, very far away and sure looked like it was cutting across the sky faster than planes I know.  It was as bright as the planets I was looking at. 
 
Hope some people saw it too. 
 
Maybe space junk? Saw this posted when I was looking to see if anyone saw the same as me.

About 7 PM EST my mother said there goes the mail plane. I looked out to the southwest and there above the tree line was an orange ball just sitting there.  I watched for a few minutes and thought why is it just sitting there and it didn’t look like any plane I had seen before.  There was no sound like a plane.  There was no sound at all. 
 
I went out to the field that runs south along the side of the house so I could get a direct view of this object.  Once out there a second one moved vertically up from behind the tree line.   Now there are two of them sitting there.  Then, they started moving horizontally slowly back and forth, but they were not doing this in tandem.  They also moved slowly vertically, again not in tandem.   
 
After about 3 hours one moved to the north again vertically and vanished behind the wood line and the other in the same fashion followed. 
 
I went back to the house but kept going outside looking up to see if whatever these were would show up and about fifteen minutes later I saw one coming directly overhead. This would be now moving in a western direction.  It stopped over the house.  It was now at a much higher elevation.  I watched it for about fifteen minutes and then went back in the house. 
 
I returned and it was gone so I went to the front of the house and there it was stationary in the front of the house. 
 
I decided to go back out to the field to see if the second orange ball might have returned to the place in the southwest where I had first seen these objects, but it was not there.  I was about to go back in the house when directly south two more orange orbs came up vertically from behind the tree line.  They were moving in the same fashion as the first two balls. And then they began to move horizontally to the south. 
 
All these objects were moving, not drifting.  It was about 11:30PM and I began to get a creepy feeling about these objects so I went back to the house. 
 
At 1:00PM I went back out to see is the orb that had stopped at the front of the house was still there and it was. 
 
When I came back to visit my mother at Christmas the orb at the front of the house was still there.  Between Thanksgiving and Christmas I had asked my mother if the object was still in the front of the house and the answer was always yes. 
 
It is no longer there, so I don’t know what these objects might have been but they were like nothing I had ever seen before. 
 
I took the most interest in watching these objects but there were two other observers.  Whether they would be willing to write their opinions I would have to ask.

On November 20, 2020, a very bright star caught my eye but it appeared to be moving. I started to record it on my iPhone figuring I could zoom in on the video to get a closer look. I took 2 videos-VIDEO 1 was a minute long and VIDEO 2 was a 2 second video that I must have taken by accident. I adjusted brightness contrast on the 1 minute video to get a better idea as to how much the light orb had moved in relation to the background and what I saw definitely seemed odd. I sent the 1 minute video to my boyfriend who was a few miles away picking up his son from daycare. He responded with a video of his own (VIDEO 3) saying he just saw the same thing 30 minutes after I saw it. In his video, he shined a flashlight at it. In response, the light quickly rose in the sky until it was almost directly over his head. At that point, he got back in his car and left. The orb must have been closer to him than me because we compared sizes and what he saw was about 5 times lar! ger than what I saw. 
 
 Things to look for in VIDEO 1 - the distance the light orb moved within the one minute video - The thing that swoops in at the top of the screen about 20 seconds in. Doubtful it was a bug since it was almost the end of November in the northeast. Also, I didn’t see this until I watched the video - The appearance of a second orb above the first ** the light orb had some similarities to the star Sirius but it couldn’t have been Sirius because it moved from one location to another and because Sirius didn’t rise above the horizon until after 10pm (5 hours after the video was taken). I confirmed that through an interactive sky chart on skyandtelescope.org. In fact, there were no planets and no other significant stars in my viewing area at that time. 
 
 Things to look for in VIDEO 2 (you may have to manually scrub through the video to see it almost frame by frame because stuff happens so fast you could miss it. 
 
- at first you see the 2 spheres that were seen in VIDEO 1. 
 
* Then the bottom sphere disappears just as some Christmas tree/centipede shaped object flies across the screen in the top left corner. Whatever this thing was, it was moving at an incredible speed and I didn’t see it while I was taking the video. It’s kind of hard to determine how close it was to me but either way, it’s large and seems like something I should have been able to see with the naked eye  VIDEO 3 is my boyfriends video which I explained earlier",41.5638,-73.7953

I am a gazer and enjoy a clear night to locate and identify many objects and position in my little section of the sky. In 20+ years I have become familiar with an assortment of craft sharing our LI skies. I can recognize the difference between the Yaphank and South Hampton US military equipment performing maneuvers(usually during late evenings) and know where their insallations are located vs passenger liners en route to and from Islip Int'l Airport, JFK and LaGuardia airports by  regulated identification marker lights.  I know the distinctive nightime sounds of chopper blade rotation and winged craft props, jet exhaust rumbling, etc. operated by NY Suffolk County Police and various NEWS choppers, instantly, when vectoring over my ""area"".  So, I have become unimpressed by their appearance due to familiarity. 
 
On Jan. 4, 2012 at approximately 7:30 pm EST I became aware of the unusual amount of aircraft traffic flying in unfamiliar patterns over Western LI . 
 
I was alarmed by the number of visible craft flying in a seemingly congested space at various altitudes and unusual patterns ranging from N-S, W-E, W-N, NE-S.  During the next few hours, I watched multiple craft flying varying directions in distances of 1 mile to 5 miles(ed. guess)from my location. 
 
The patterns, criss-crossing pilot maneuvers, low altitude banking and deliberate circling about kept my attention and was unsettling. 
 
Description of moving craft ""lights"" varied from single solid amber to solitary white strobe, some( I think they may have been choppers) strobed white AND red flashers. There were low flying, fast-moving craft outfitted with huge double tiered solid red lights positioned aft. 
 
It was hard to distinguish which craft made which sound. 
 
On Jan. 5,2012 (night #2) I again witnessed multiple white and amber lights in the W-S/W sky at approximately 7:30 pm.  I am aware that Venus was low in the evening sky at similar location.  This was not Venus......unless Venus can somehow switch from her familiar bright, head spotlight look into an upturned, spinning triangular shape with the ability to hover over the same area. 
 
Many craft were ""scrambling"" in all directions, again.  Why?  I have no idea. 
 
I blogged News12 on Jan. 6, 2012 asking if I was alone in my sighting - if someone could tell me what was that??  I continue to watch multiple craft (I think military) in the sky from dusk 'till 2:00 am EST.  After that, its quiet. 
 
Any information would help

- [ ] Within the past year I took on fun hobby of drone flying. I live in a beautiful part of Connecticut and I have a few places I enjoy flying because of the incredible scenery and also the lack of any major interference which allows me to travel further and cover more area.  One day I decided to watch some footage of a fairly remarkable flight I recently captured a few days prior. What made it remarkable was it was the furthest that I have ever flown the drone up till the current point in time. As I was watching this fairly uneventful footage my eye catches something race past the screen at in insane rate of speed, which at fists glance would appear to be a bug which flew past the drones camera very closely. After close examination of the footage it appears that I caught the elusive “fast-walker” on footage. The video shows that this object appears from the extreme horizon which I estimated to be at distance of about 6 miles. The object headed almost dire! ctly towards the drone (Northbound) in a banking motion, as if it is investigating the only other craft in its immediate airspace, then the object disappears from frame almost directly underneath my drone. And all that happened in 1.3 seconds, which means this thing was traveling at a cool 20,000 mph… Yes, you too can see this for yourself, as I uploaded this onto YouTube for the benefit of all. Please note that I am not a professional video editor, I put this video together with a limited amount of a/v knowledge and equipment.

I kept staring at the light for 2-3 minutes after which point, it started turning an orange hue and began to move.  It slowly kept moving in an Easterly direction.

My husband went outside to use our grill and quickly called me out to our back deck.  He pointed out a bright light, which appeared to be hovering in the distance, on the left side of our property.  He then pointed to the opposite side of our property and there were between 5-7 very bright lights, which also appeared to hovering.  When scanning from the right side of our house to the left side, you could clearly see they formed a semi circle around the area.  Since there were some trees obstructing our view outside, we ran inside to a large window in the dining room on the side of the house.  From there, we were able to get a very clear view of the lights to the right of our house.  None were moving, all appeared to be hovering.  We questioned if they were perhaps planes, but again, they were not moving and there were no additional lights on them.  Also, I'm sure planes would not even be allowed that close in proximity to each other.  I assume being that clo! se they would be considered in each others air space.  We sat there and watched them for about 20 minutes and then they abruptly disappeared.  They did not fly away or dim, they literally just disappeared.  My husband took video from inside the house which did not come out good, likely due to the window glare.  Shortly after they disappeared (about 10 minutes), another appeared by itself.  I took video of this one from our deck.  It is not good quality, you can only tell that it is a bright light, BUT you can plainly see that it is not moving, just hovering.  We're not totally sure what we saw, but these were definitely not planes.  Very curious to know if anyone else in the area saw this as well.  We live in Lowell, MA.

At 4:17 on 11/22/2016 on Route 111 in Atkinson, New Hampshire, below a cloud cover, hovered an unknown, potentially hazardous object. The object, initially appearing to be a star or planet, emitted a strong white light.  It would have been impossible to determine this object as a star or planet as the sun was in full shine and the object was against the backdrop of the cloud cover. 
 
	While first being obscured by the powerful luminescence it emanated, a witness travelled on the road, growing closer to the object.  To the witness, this craft was nearly indistinguishable from the altitude of approximately 3,300 feet above sea level. However, what appeared to be a metallic object with the shape of  4 claw-like arms emitting a white light became apparent as the witness drew closer.  Approximately 5 minutes after the initial sighting, the craft accelerated at an extraordinarily fast speed directly up into the cloud cover. 
 
	The witness’s motor vehicle was temporarily incapacitated by what appeared to be the movement of the craft.  Lights, heating systems, and windows ceased function for 11 seconds.  There was no apparent stalling of the engine. 
 
	15 minutes later, near the junction of South Road, Brentwood, and Exeter Road, Exeter, the object reappeared to the same witness, this time in much closer vicinity, approximately 1,000 feet above the ground.  The shape of the object was not of human design that we know of. Four appendages, each extending from a single circular base, formed a claw shape, with each “claw” pointing downwards at the surface. 
 
The object was a silvery-black metallic color, and pulsed several times with white lights.  At this point, malfunctions in most systems of the car began to occur.  Heating was cut, electricity went dead, and the engine stalled as the car pulled to a stop.  At this time, there was nobody else on the road. 
 
The witness noticed a strange, constant howling noise coming from the craft, almost like an animal scream combined with the running of a jet engine.  The object or craft hung over the road for several more seconds, before shooting up into the sky with what sounded like a sonic boom, or a similar explosion sound.

We were driving on Interstate 295 Southbound, when three orange lights appeared on the right side of the car, about 100 feet above, just entering the tree line.   
 
Then a fourth trailing light to the right of the triangle; it was transparent due to the fact that clouds could be seen in between the lights, so maybe four separate orange lights.   
 
The orange was like a street light but a much softer glow.   
 
We think they were Fire Lanterns.  Pretty incredible site though.",43.734,-70.2625

On Saturday, May 2, 2020 between 5 and 5:15PM in Lewiston, ME I saw 3 white dots moving around in the sky, right below a very visible moon. It was 60 degrees and sunny out but the moon was visible and I just happened to be admiring it when I saw the 3 dots.  I watched them for about 10 seconds before calling my house mates, who were also outside, to see what I was seeing. 
 
The 3 white dots were moving in close proximity to each other, horizontally and diagonally. They didn’t cross each other’s paths but moved closer and farther away from each other intermittently.  Three of these UFOs were visible simultaneously at first, then we only saw 2 at a time for the remainder of the encounter.  They faded in and out of visibility, sometimes with none of them visible at all for brief moments.  They reappeared in different positions in the sky compared to when they went out of focus.  We got a little freaked out because their position in the sky descended as time went on. 
 
 We watched this for about five minutes.  The whole time, there was a very long, patchy cloud visible under the moon in an otherwise blue sky.  Once this cloud disappeared, so did the multiple, moving white dots.  We continued looking at the sky for more activity but didn’t witness anything else after the cloud dissipated.  We didn’t collect any video footage even though we discussed trying but, none of us wanted to reach for our phones on the table a few yards away and miss anything.  We also doubted if we could capture it.  It’s all we’ve been able to talk about and everyone we’ve shared it with has told us it was just “Starlink.” No! No it wasn’t!",44.0969,-70.1863

It seemed close but then seemed to recede or get smaller as it traveled in a slow zig zag across the night sky before it past behind the treeline and i could not follow it any more. there was no noise.

As I was admiring the night sky outside our camp I looked North towards Greenville and saw a red/green flashing light, thinking it was a plane but it did not move, it stayed stationary.   
 
I watched it for awhile from the deck, then saw another smaller white light moving from the east to west that seemed to go beneath it.  I assumed this to be a plane.   
 
I called to my husband and we went upstairs w/ binoculars for a better view.  It was still too far in the distance to make out anything clearly other than the red/green light.   
 
We watched for about 20 mins and it did not move at all.   
 
I looked again just befor bed at about 10 and did not see it at all.",45.4694,-69.5807

Cigar shape daylight object.  Has distinct cigar, almost saucer shape outline, not shape like a usual airplane.  It was above tree line, but too far away to see detail.  I normally would not report this, but it had unusual shape.  It was white color and straight, not tilted.  It was moving slowly but lost sight as it moved away.  It may have been a manmade object of some sort but no binoculars to get a closer view.  Anyways, the unusual design of the object is the reason I reported it.

My wife, my friend, and myself were out fishing this night and noticed that there was a light off in the distance.  We kept on fishing and began to notice that the object in the sky was getting closer to us and the lights were getting brighter.  They were in the shape of a backwards triangle at first then when it got closer to us you could see that it was actually in the shape of a diamond.  This whole time my friend was taping the craft and then asked me to take over the camera for him.  I zoomed in as far as the camera would let me to try and make out the shape of the object and when i zoomed back out i could see that it was hovering over us for quite some time.  I want to know what this was because it scared the life out of us all..  And of course the only sounds that you could hear are the frogs, the campfire that we had going and also our voices talking to let people know that we did not turn the volume off.",45.6574,-68.7102
