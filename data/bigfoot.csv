"Well last year I was night fishing 9/2010 at Amawalk Reservior SOMERS NY about 30 minutes from PAWLINGS I was fishing with my buddy..the reservior was about 100ft into the lake before you got to water .....about 5am sun was coming out..when a 5 foot maybe 5 1/2 ft man  or Big Foot came out of the woods washed its face and drank some of the reservoir water..he looked like something out of the old school ""Planets of the Apes"" chimps..I said to my buddy ""you see that?""?he said yes ..Now on Animal Planet there showing a clip of a Big Foot that has been seen in these areas (Lower Hudson Valley)..So I'm puzzled to think what I saw was a Big Foot....so this my account of what I saw..and we didn't catch crap at night..anybody ever run into anything like this??... This was my post on www.westchesterfishing.com Low and be hold another member at the same reservior..Columbus day 2011..this is his post..Hey Guys, I put at Amawalk this summer and about the 5th time I took it out in early October.  I saw two upright walking chimp looking things walk out of the woods and crouch down and drink from the res, run back in to the woods and then do the same thing again.  When they came out the second time one of them threw it's arms in the air while squatting and then they ran back into the woods.   The second one went back slowly.  It seemed like they saw something in the water right in front of them.  That was right when the sun came up.  I haven't been back to my boat since.  I have no idea what they were and looked like two large chimps to me.  Maybe some guy who lives there has two monkeys or something?  I have no idea.  But I saw something that I can't explain, it has been eating away at me since.  When I saw the preview for that show I almost shat myself.  When Biggame posted here I didn't want to say that I saw something because I'm from Oregon and my hunting and logging part of the family thinks they know where they live but none of them have never ever seen them just have stories, just like everyone else in Oregon.  Then I saw what I saw in October and have been denying it to myself ever since.  I absolutely hope that someone owns two monkey's on the Amawalk. I have no reason to say something like this.  Before October I could have cared less if bigfoot existed, now I'm a bit curious.  I own a fishing rod company and have business to lose from people thinking I'm crazy for posting this on here.  This is a nothing to gain and allot to lose situation for me but, I had to say something when Biggame posted.  Let me be clear in saying that I saw something too.  I have no idea what they were and would need absolute proof that bigfoot existed before I would ever say thats what they were. So two seperate sightings same place different year..I BELIEVE!!!",Both sightings were on the North east corner of the reservoir..the lake was low..I saw it walk and stick its face in the water like a dog,Westchester County,New York,Fall,41.29873,-73.73717,9/1/10,31940,Class A,92.24,80.81,69.38,0.76,Clear throughout the day.
I was on my way to Claremont from Lebanon on Rte 120 and was passing by some reeds in a marshy area next to the road that sounded like a huge flock of birds. The creature came out of the reeds and was crouched down looking at me through them. Surprisingly it got out of the reeds from crouched to standing turned around and ran towards the wooded area up a hill and was moving with it's arms brush and tree branches out of the way. It was incredibly fast runner and I got a good look at its coconut shaped head as it ran away. It was light brown/brown. It had incredibly broad shoulders. I went back the same day. The marsh went up to my knees and I could smell a bad odor like garbage. Myself and a friend went back to the sighting. We found a footprint and a hair sample. I could hear wood knocks when my friend James did a call and we also found a large bed of branches and some tree structures. The following month I went back to Claremont and I heard screeching in the woods while I was traveling Rte. 120 on a bicycle.,Close to Claremont down 120 not far from Kingston road.,Sullivan County,New Hampshire,Summer,43.41549,-72.33093,6/7/16,55269,Class A,74.69,64.245,53.8,0.1,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.
"I was northeast of Macy Nebraska along the Missouri River taking part in an expedition hosted by members of the Omaha Indian tribe. We were on the Omaha Reservation.  These tribal members say they've had many sightings in the hilly bluff zone extending for miles along the west flank of the Missouri River Basin. Five of us had decided to take a day hike to see a possible “X” structure. As we started up the path it became known that to get to the “X” we’d have to veer off the main path and bushwhack through the weeds. Two people did this while three of us decided to stay on the clearer but muddy path. (I still have never seen this ""X"" but pictures are available.) As we headed up the trail one of my Native American companions said he was hearing movement in the woods to our right. At this point we could not see very far off the path as trees and brush blocked the view. I did not hear the movement. We continued forward and came to an area where trees had been cut down in the past. We could see maybe 40-50 yards back into the forest. Two of us looked to our right as soon as we made it to this clearer area and immediately saw movement. I saw a long light brown object that was swinging downward from a horizontal position toward. It was not indicative of any other animal that I can think of and was bent slightly at an apparent elbow. I could not see a hand because of the brush. At the time of the sighting the other witness started telling us what HE just saw. He said “I just saw one” and described seeing the whole upper body of a light brown Sasquatch. Apparently when it noticed us it started to drop down and move to its right (our left) behind cover. He said as it was ducking down the arm had swung way up in the air and back down, and he demonstrated. His description and demonstration exactly matched what I had seen. He did not know that I had also seen it as he was telling me his story. I took a picture of the area where the sighting happened. This subject was behind and to the right of a stick pointing upward. On July 27th 2018, I revisited the location with BFRO investigator T. Bell and hacked my way back into this spot. We determined that the top of the stick is about 11 feet high, making the top of the swinging ‘arm’ at around 9 feet tall. On the day of the sighting I was not prepared to bushwhack back into the site where the subject was seen. I was better prepared when we returned on July 27th. I have already done an interview with the BFRO investigator just after our recreation attempt. This subject was MUCH larger than me. It could very easily be 10 + feet as it was already ducking away when I saw it.",Latitude & Longitude :  42.158230  -96.344197,Thurston County,Nebraska,Spring,42.15685,-96.34203,5/25/18,59757,Class B,93.4,77.7,62,0.38,Partly cloudy in the morning.
"My two friends and I were camping near Busick, NC, just east of the Smokey Mountain National Park.   We were northeest of Asheville, near the Blue Ridge Parkway.    (Busick is so small that google earth does not have a marker for it.)   On the first of the two nights we were there, we heard wierd yells going through the woods right after dark.   Later, while we were sitting near the campfire playing dominos, we heard the same yell and heard rustling in the woods nearby.   We couldn't distinguish what it was because there were some people singing christian hymns at a small theatre nearby.   Later that night, when I was asleep, my friends(they were brothers) were talking about the upcoming wedding of one of them this coming spring and the younger brother says that he saw it move through the woods very close to our camp.   He told me about it the next day and I got kind of scared, since I may have seen a bigfoot in New Mexico back in 1994 while in the boy scouts.   The next day the two brothers went on a long hike and I stayed in camp since I was experiencing foot problems and had no hiking boots.    I got really bored so I decided to walk down what seemed to be a game trail into the woods for a few hundred yards.   I noticed that there were a lot of trees that were broken, like something had bended them.   None of these trees were very thick, but there were a few that I knew I could not snap.   I started to get a little scared, like something wasn't right.   I was only about a 1/4 mile from the campground, and I saw it.   It scared the s**t out of me.   I only saw it for about 10-15 seconds(maybe, I was so scared it could've been 5 seconds or it could have been a minute), and the best way to describe it would be that it looked like the bigfoot from Harry and the Hendersons only it was heavier and a little bit darker.   I was probably about 15-30 feet from it when I saw it.   We stared at each other for the duration of my sighting, and then it walked away as if I wasn't anything to worry about.    I stood in that spot for a little while and then walked back to the campsite, stopping every now and then to look around for the thing.   I told my friends about it and after describing the thing the one brother who saw it the night before said that it was probably the same thing he saw.","Pisgah National Forest, Black Mountain Campground",Yancey County,North Carolina,Summer,35.75278,-82.22121,8/21/11,30860,Class A,78.53,70.4,62.27,0.74,Foggy in the morning.
"It was August of 1977 and I had missed my ride home from Hacketstown NJ to Byram NJ. The road to get back to Byram is Waterloo Rd. It was about 9:30-10:00 PM so I decided to hitch hike it on Waterloo hoping that someone would give me a lift back to HWY-206. It was very dark and as I was walking past Stephens State Park and then the old Saxton Falls area, I could hear something that sounded like it was on 2 feet stalking me in the woods on the ridge side of Waterloo Rd. It got very interesting when I started sprinting, it also started sprinting keeping up with me for what seemed like at least a mile. When I would walk, it would walk. It was loud as it went thru the woods as I stayed on the road hoping for a car to pick me up. Eventually I did get a ride near a few houses after passing an old Tavern on the river side of Waterloo Rd.","Waterloo Road, near the Sussex - Warren County border.",Warren County,New Jersey,Summer,40.89452,-74.79077,10/2/15,49883,Class B,49.06,46.65,44.24,0.67,Light rain starting in the afternoon.

"I am not sure that I had sighting. The reason I am writing this is because I listened to the ""Whoops and Knocks"" recording from CA, and it reminded me of what I heard while I was hunting on Tuesday afternoon. I was hunting with friends in the Swan Valley of MT. I do not know the exact location, because we were in the backwoods, and traveling on back roads off of Highway 83. We were on the east side of the highway north of Condon and I beleive south of town Swan. My Partner and I split up (our other partner was in his truck up the road). He was to my left 150 yards and in front of me by 200 yards. I saw something brown in the corner of my eye pass behind a tree to my right, hoping it was a deer or elk, I started to head in that direction. My partner contined heading toward and through a ravine. I would walk, and then stop for about 10-20 seconds looking around. I kept hearing a knocking sound. I thought it was a very close woodpecker, but could never see one.Plus it was really loud. After I decided that I must of lost the deer or elk, I decided to head down into the ravine my friend has been went through about 5-10 minute before me. The knocking sound became loud and I was sure that it just was very loud wood pecker, or deer ruttings(The rut is not for a couple of more weeks). The sound always came from the right of me. After hearing knocks on the recording in the Seirra Mountains, I am about 98% sure that is what I heard. Wood or something hitting wood, which also explains the volume and pacing of the knocking. I walked down into a ravine and it got a littel louder. Then all of sudden the knocking just stopped. I decided to go find my partner and walked out the ravine to the other side. I could not find him, so I went back through the ravine, and heard more knocking.I walked back somwhere between 1/2 to mile to our drop off point on the road (I came out about 100 ft to right of the spot), and thought I heard and elk call (which none of my partners heard) but sounds very much like the whoop call after the 1/2 point of the recording. The two men I was hunting with are expereinced hunters and in the woods. It was my second time hunting.  I told them about what I thought was the elk call, and neither of them heard it. When I heard it I was probably atleast 1/2 mile from them. I did not mention the knocking, because I though it was bird, and no big deal. I have hiked/backpacked in Tenn,CT,NC,AZ, The Cascades in WA, Grand Coulee Dam Area of WA, and enjoy being in the woods. This is my first time that anything like this has happened. I will leave the verdict up to you, You are the experts not me. If this was a sighting then great I am glad that I could help. If not then that is fine too","While I cannot give a specific location, I will do my best. We were off  highway 83 east towards the mountains.

"I'm a Native American from Montana. I live on the Flathead Indian Reservation. About two years ago I was hunting up on your mission mountains. The spot I was hunting is called North Crow. I was driving up through there looking for deer. I was coming to this corner and out of the corner of my left eye I seen him standing close to the road but still in a little bit of trees. I knew what it was. About a mile up the road ends, I knew I had to come back down. I was so scared to go back down but I knew I had to. I was driving pretty fast back down and did not look anywhere, just eyes on the road. I did not want to see him again.

One night at around 11 pm I was outside just before going to bed and I heard what I thought was a very loud screams from a woman west of me toward the river.  I was ready to get in my truck and investigate the screaming but the screams were not human.  All of the horses in my boarding pens were snorting and looking west toward the river.  My Australian shepherd dog was also acting very strange; growling and his hair was standing up.  A large number of whitetail deer lived along the river and routinely came down to my place to feed on any hay left over on the ground.  They were a real nuisance. I did not see or hear anything else but I will never forget that sound and the way the horses were acting; similar to smelling a bear.

"It was about 3 p.m. Early in December of 2012. I was up at my cabin cutting up an elk and had to run into town to get some pork suit for hamburger. I have made it a habit to keep track of where the ranchers have their cattle near the highway so I know where the elk will or will not be. On my way back I was driving about 60 mph while scanning a ridge side and tree line where I had seen elk before when I noticed something very out of place and very dark running along the tree line.

It was about 230 to 300 yards away and I could make it out quite well.

"I went to visit my brother who had gotten a firefighting job up in Montana recently and on one of his days off, I wanted to go up into the secluded woods on a hike.

We hiked about a mile and a half up into the mountains and about half way up, we crossed a little creek about 4 to 5 feet wide. I stopped and pulled out my phone to take a picture of the upstream view. I got the picture and we continued on without realizing what he had just done. Later that night I was going through the pictures of that days hike, when I came across something in one of the pictures that was extremely startling.

"On November 24th, 2012, at 9:00 AM, I was elk hunting on the west facing slope of Mount Baldy, above a closed forest service road called Baldy Face Road. There was a complete trail of these bi-pedal tracks leading around the face of the mountain. I've taken a picture of a track with my boot next to it as a point of reference as to the size of the track. My boot measures exactly one foot, and four and half inches wide, and my average step is about three feet. I am six foot and one inches and had to leap to reach each track. I'm guessing it had a rough estimate of a five foot step, which were heading north, north east up the mountain. I know it wasn't a snowshoe because snow shoes are so long that they overlap themselves, and have a hinged claw in the middle for traction which these tracks showed no sign of. Each step was long and clean, bearing no signs of drag. I guessed the tracks to be about 4-5 days old. I side hilled the mountain heading south, then down to the road back north, only to see my tracks being the only ones up off the road since it snowed. I've never crossed another person's tracks up there before, since its a pretty secluded area that has hidden lakes for the willing hiker. But never a track like this one ever.

We were camping in the Davidson river camp ground on a tent site a bit further up from the river. It was about 1 am or so the night of sep 10 morning of sep 11. We both had to use the restroom . We unzipped the tent and went outside. We heard some rustling from behind our tent as we turned around to look there was a Bigfoot just standing there looking at us and we were looking back at him. He was right beside a pine tree and where he came on the tree he had to be 8 or 9 feet tall. The moonlight came through the thick Forrest to cast just enough light on him. He or she was albino. The fur was completely white. I couldn't tell you what color the eyes were. My daughter and I both looked at this creature and didn't say a word . We simply got back into our tent and started to ask each other questions to see if we both saw what we think we saw. Our stories matched.  Needless to say we stayed awake all night and didn't dare use the restroom. We did  hear more rustling and dogs barking in the distance for the rest of the night.,Pisgah national forest Davidson river campground,Transylvania County,North Carolina,Fall,35.1685,-82.488,9/10/11,58022,Class A,80.38,65.44,50.5,0.46,Clear throughout the day.
"Early on the morning of 10/13/2015 while driving through North Carolina I saw the unexplainable and it blew me away. At approximately 12:30am I was driving south on I95 near exit 2 or 3 just a few miles from the South Carolina border with a tractor trailer approximately 400-500 yards in front of me. I had been following this truck for awhile when it looked like something had either been hit by the truck, kicked up or maybe a deer crossed behind the truck. In quick order, first the right taillight then the reflective material in the middle then the left tail light went dark and came back on. Instantly I cancelled the cruise control, steered my vehicle to straddle the center line thinking I would either have to avoid some debris in the road or avoid a deer that could be standing in the road and leaned towards the windshield to get a better look. As I approached the spot where this happened there was nothing in the road, but standing on the median side of the road was for lack of better understanding a Bigfoot! It was hairy from head to toe and huge. At least 7' tall. As I got closer it took two huge steps and went down the side of the embankment into the median. I was literally no more then 10-15' away from it when passing it. I was able to hit the high beams as it took the second step. This entire scenario played out in probably 10 seconds or so. I can not come up with a reasonable explanation for what I saw. It was not a man, no clothing and hairy plus the stride length was insane. I'm 6' 4"" and no way I could have a stride that long. It was not a bear, it was standing on two legs and had arms and hands. This thing was nearly impossible to see even with the head lights on high beam it was so black. The only reasonable explanation I could come up with it was some nut job in a ghillie suit playing frogger. However the two steps it took were much longer then any man could make.",I'm not sure if it was just prior to exit 3 or 2.

"I want to report a sighting of a huge Bigfoot. As my husband and I often do, we were taking a short cut across the mountain here in western NC, heading home. As I was driving along the river, there was a very strange looking, what I thought was an odd looking man, and as we passed it, I said to my husband, "" That is a strange looking person,"" and as I looked into the rear view mirror, it stood up on the road and was watching us driving away, and that is when I realized what it really was. I told my husband that it is a Bigfoot!!! In a panic I drove away and my husband insisted that we turn around and go back. I was in tears from the fear, but we found an area to turn around and I do so.  As we approached that area, we saw it on the side of the road watching us. He was HUGE!!!! My husband got out of the car to get a better look and he couldn't believe what we were looking at. It had to be at least 8-9 feet tall, covered in long black hair all over it's body. It was massive. We were about 100 yards away and nothing was obstructing our view.

"October 2011 we found footprints leading away from our outdoors fire pit. Something had stepped in wet ashes after a big storm. We could see where it had tried to wipe ash off on rocks and then took long strides across the yard. Several years later (year not recalled) on a camping trip near same area. At about 7pm I heard heavy footfalls, a knock in a pattern of 5 or 6 knocks. Then about 100 yards away from that I heard another commotion and more heavy footfalls running toward the 1st. It sounded like the 2 animals met and a flock of turkeys sleeping in a thicker was just anihilated. The attack lasted 15 seconds with the turkeys screeching and flapping loudly. Later that night I heard the same knocking pattern and then an answer in the far distance with the same pattern. A few years later back at my home. During a break in a huge storm at about 2 am I heard something trying to climb over wire fence in my back yard. My son and I went out with guns as we've had some vandalism incidents. On the back porch, the fence was still shaking and we heard footsteps crashing to our left. I yelled out for whoever it might be to leave us alone. I announced we were armed. Then we heard a loud crack like a rifle shot from the direction of the footsteps. At this time we were really afraid and I emptied my shotgun toward the crack sound. There were several more pops and I pushed my son and now awake wife back in the house and then emptied my 22 rifle also. As my son handed me the shotgun he'd reloaded... the cracking increased and I realized something was pushing a huge tree over and the cracks were the splitting of wood. The tree crashed to the ground literally shaking the whole house. My family pushed their way back outside, terrified. And we all heard loud footfalls running away from the fallen tree.","Near the Green River gamelands in Polk County, NC and right at Lake Adger.",Polk County,North Carolina,Fall,35.28195,-82.39165,10/4/11,67582,Class B,72.74,59.26,45.78,0.28,Clear throughout the day.
"Shortly after laying down for the night during a backpacking trip in the Nantahala Wilderness, we heard a howl that lasted 10-15 seconds, with a change of tone for the last few seconds. This howl could not have been mistaken for any other animal and sounded very similar to recordings of other howls. In the next 2 hours we both heard random whoops also.  The next day while hiking we came across several very interesting signs along the trail. The first was spotting what looked like a game trail that crossed the hiking trail. Upon closer inspection, the tracks in the well traveled trail clearly were not made by bear or any other four legged animal.  The footprints on the trail had left deep impressions where the heel contacted the ground and footprints much larger than my foot were also seen.  The distance between the tracks was approximately 5 feet on average and the depth of the tracks where the heel had sunk down was 3 plus inches.   The ferns and weeds in the trail that had been pressed down were still green and flat which made me think the tracks had been made within the past couple of days. I followed the trail in both directions for approximately 150 yards and the footprints remained consistent in both directions.  After traveling the hiking trail further down the ridgeline for close to mile I spotted another trail that crossed the hiking trail. The footprints here were identical to what we saw at the first trail. I took pictures to gauge the depth and length of the prints.  I found a stick on this trail that had blood on it.  I regret not keeping it for evidence to see what type of blood it was.  The location of both trails had some similarities: both were located in gaps along the ridgeline and there was an unusually high amount of limbs and trees wedged in tree forks at both sites.  One other strange observation made along the trail was finding 3 large white mushrooms placed upside down near the trails. One of these was on a rock and another was found on the trail while following the footprints.  The area where we found these signs was the direction where we had heard the howl the night before.",The tracks and trails were on the lower ridge trail 2-3 miles from Standing Indian campground.,Macon County,North Carolina,Summer,30.0326,-83.52959,6/29/15,49148,Class B,82.8,81.985,81.17,0.41,Humid throughout the day and breezy in the morning.

"I backpack in Uwharrie with a group of up to six kids on a regular basis as a trip leader for a wilderness outing program.  This past winter I experienced the same strange occurrance on two different occasions in the same spot at a primitive campsite our group had scratched out along the Super Tree Loop in the Woodrun area of the forest.  During the wee hours of the morning in Dec. and once again in Jan. I've heard footsteps crunching through the heavy layer of dried leaves on the forest floor.  This ""person"" was buswhwacking and not walking along the trail.  ""It"" also came from the direction of deep woods just behind my tent and not anywhere near the main trail.  Both times it crossed over the trail and continued on bushwacking through the woods in an easterly direction.  I have to admit I was a little nervous about even moving around in my tent because I didn't want to attract attention.  I laid there frozen both times until the thing was gone and didn't get a look at it.  Both incidents happened on especially cold nights in Uwharrie (mid to upper teens).  Hunting season was long over as well.  Whatever it was did not use a flashlight and walked through the dense woods of this area smoothly without missing a step.

A friend and I was camping at Arrowhead Campground at Uwharrie Nat Forrest. We heard something in the woods on the outskirts of the camp probing the camping area. The next morning my friend asked me if I heard something. I told him that I did and I just did not think anything about it. I asked him what he thought it was. He said it was definately walking on two feet and it was not a person. By the sound of the breaking branches he said it had to be big. It was late October and the ground had a lot of leaves and sticks on the ground. We where at campsites 14a and 14b if I recall correctly. Arrowhead Campground is located near Badin Lake and wildlife is abundant including deer. My friend was a skeptical before that but he was a little stifled by the sounds we heard that night. I asked him if it could have been a horse wandering from the above horse camp or a bear and he said it was walking on two feet like a man but had to be much larger because of the amount of noise of the breaking branches and leaves. We were only around 10 meters from the wood line. We are both professionals in our jobs and he is very trustworthy. I am an Army veteran a have a lot of time in the woods of N.C. GA.

"This happened around 2014 in the Thickety Creek community of Montgomery County, south of the county seat of Troy. A friend at church asked me if I could come down and check his creek for gold. He knew I liked to do some gold panning as a hobby. We never settled on a day or time, I just told him I would come by one day when I got a chance. I ended up getting off work early one day and decided to run down and wash some rocks. So, I parked at his gate and grabbed my backpack at gear and walked about 200 yards from the road. To my left is the creek with about 4ft banks and a steep mountain to my right. I walked down looking for a place to easily get down into the creek without lots of brush. This area is well known for huge Timber Rattlers. So I find a spot next to a huge flat rock that I end up using as a work station. After a couple hours of panning I stopped to take a break. I always freeze a 2 liter bottle of water and drink it as it melts. I’m standing there drinking the water and I hear something fly through the trees above my head. My first thought was “I’ve never heard a bird fly through the trees and hit limbs and leaves like that! Why is it doing that?” So as I stand there puzzled and confused I hear more commotion coming through the tree tops! This time my eyes focus on the sound and I see a rock about the size of a Jr sized football flying over my head and on the bank on the other side of the creek! As I stand there stunned, racking my brain try to make sense of it, I unsnap my 9mm and shout in that direction “You stay over there and I’ll stay over here!” Needless to say I packed up and left, feeling like I’m being watched the whole time! I threw my stuff in the back of my truck and hauled buggy out of there! I don’t know of any animal in the woods that can throw a rock that big that far! I was so effected that I gave up gold panning and hunting for the most part! I never told the land owner or anybody else for that matter for a few years. I still don’t tell many folks.

"I was camping with a friend in the Uwharrie National Forest.  We camped by the first creek bottom on the North section of Dutchmans Trail.  We turned into our hammocks about 7:30pm and soon everything started.  I heard a lot of moving about on the other side of a nearly dry creek bed around 8:00 pm.  The movement was a large animal by the sound of the larger branches breaking.  The animal came across the creek near a spot we had been using as our latrine.  I turned on my headlamp and yelled out ""go on"" thinking bear or something.  The movement stopped but then started closer to the camp so I yelled out again.  Then I got a bit scared when two rocks were smashed together ""bang, bang (pause) then bang bang"" again. This freaked me out a bit so I yelled again.  Then above me on the hillside I heard something being thrown through the woods and landing further down the small valley we were in.  Then the day birds started chirping in an arc across the hill side.  Not long after an owl started hooting quite far away.  Dogs started barking all over the forest and the owl stopped.  Then I heard a wail deeper in the woods and it seemed like after the wail the woods went back to normal.  I have spent a lot of time in the woods but this chain of events that went on from 8:00pm to around 12:00 am has unnerved me a bit.  I knew of these creatures but half believed in them but I have had an experience that has changed how I feel in the woods at night.",Where the Dutchman and Uwharrie recreational trails cross take the North section.

"I wasn't going to share this until i saw a similar experience in the same area of the Uwharrie forest. I was at the trailhead of Dutchmans Creek at 9 in the morning during a week day about two weeks ago. Mine was the only car at the trailhead until after 10:30 with only logging trucks passing through every 30-45 minutes. I was walking down Dutchmans Creek, enjoying the solitude and quiet of the forest when I turned a bend and heard a loud wood knock at my two o'clock and was answered by another at my 10  o'clock within one second of the first. It threw me off because it sounded like an answering reply. I walked back up the trail and hung out for about thirty minutes just listening relaxing before I choose to head back down the trail. As i approached the same bend in the trail I again heard a wood knock at my 10 o'clock and then a second at my 5 o'clock. Extremely weird I thought, and again within one second of each other. I decided to walk back up the trail towards the second knock. There's an atv trail near the trailhead I walked up until I heard another wood knock around the same area I would have estimated the second at my 5 o'clock would have been. I waited for about fifteen minutes without hearing or seeing anything else. I decided to walk back to the base of the trail head and within twenty foot steps back down the trail I heard something huff at me from over my left shoulder. It came from inside a deep ditch but I didn't see anything there. I've had deer huff at me before when I've gotten close and they spotted me, I'm sure bear huff as well to threaten/challenge something but what got me was that I heard and saw no movement at all throughout this entire time. I walked back to the trailhead, waited 15-20 min and then snook back towards the same spot. I was completely quiet; no rustling from my clothes, boots didn't rustle plants and no crunch from dried leaves or twigs. As I approached I heard what sounded like a guttural baby moan or call. This occurred in high brush on the other side of the ditch to my right. The sound occurred every hand full of minutes and I would creep closer to see if I could spot it. Though the sound would change the direction it was facing there was never any movement in the brush and though I always carry when I'm in the woods I dared not enter into the thick brush, especially since I couldn't identify the animal that had huffed at me nor what type of animal was making the cries from in the brush. I didn't feel spooked until after the event when I thought over what had happened. I enjoy the woods, tracking and following game trails and though most of my experience is in Florida swamps with hogs or deer I couldn't identify the guttural moaning or see the thing that huffed at me.","Woodrun Dutchmans creek trailhead, sparsely used atv trail conjoined there.

"To begin, I am 34 years old, I have a degree in Biology, and I have spent my entire life in the woods mostly by myself and have grown accustomed to the noises animals and the forest itself makes. I go backpacking and backcountry camping year round. I am not an expert but I have experience in the woods. My wife, two dogs, and I were camping in Uwharrie National on October 23 -25. Friday night we heard a lot of noises ranging from coyotes far away to leaves rustling just outside our site. I just purchased a hammock and wanted to try it out in the woods. So Saturday I set up my hammock 20-30 feet into the woods just outside our site. Our site is on the side and near the entrance of the campground and the most secluded with the woods to its back; this is why we choose it. So I go to bed in the hammock Saturday night facing the campground and the woods behind me, and all is well until 2:30am, I wake up to branches breaking behind my head. The branches sounded like they could have been as close as 30 feet to as far away as 50 feet to my right. Imagine if my head is 12 o’clock and my feet are 6 o’clock, these branches were being broken at 11-12 o’clock or over my right shoulder. At first I thought it was a deer or a bear passing by but I know what they sound like as they walk (a couple months ago I was face to face with a mother bear and her cubs), but I never actually heard distinct footsteps and as the breaking didn’t move in location I became a little freaked out. I’m lying in the hammock trying to explain what is going on and nothing is making sense. I never made a noise to scare it away and didn’t shine my headlamp. Then I hear a noise that is hard to explain come from about 1 o’clock or over my left shoulder. I can only describe this as similar to the noise a deer makes when it’s alerting other deer to danger, but if a deer were to make this noise it would have to be 20 feet tall. It was deeper than any noise I’ve ever heard come from the forest. Deeper than a lion’s roar and as long as a human’s sigh. The branch breaking continued for about 15 minutes until I start hearing the alternating branch break and what sounded like a large bird flapping its wings one time. I heard ‘snap whoosh, snap whoosh, snap whoosh’. About this time, I hear my wife coughing and before we went to bed she said that her stomach was feeling a little upset, I thought maybe she is sick. I muster up the courage to get out of the hammock hoping that in doing so I will also scare away the animal. I go up to her and she’s fine, now I have a dilemma, I don’t want to go back but I can’t stay in the tent because my sleeping bag is in the woods. So I go back and I pick up a branch, snap it and throw it in to the woods three times. Then I urinate all around my hammock. While I was doing this the branch breaking had ceased. I get in the hammock and seconds after turning off my headlamp the breaking begins again. I listen, while getting more and more scared, to the breaking for a couple more minutes. I shine my light into the woods and the breaking stops, I turn off the light and it starts back. I waited a couple more minutes and turned my light on again and the breaking stops, I turn the light off and it starts back. I’m lying in the hammock completely terrified at this point and decide the only thing I should do is retreat to the tent with my wife and dogs. It was like torture to be in the hammock. So I quickly grab my sleeping bag, walk to the tent, get in, and lay down. We both heard the branches being broken for about 15 more minutes, then we heard one large break that sounded like a 4 inch log being broken in half that echoed through the woods. It was almost as if they were saying ‘And stay out’. I was so terrified and my adrenaline was pumping so much that I couldn’t sleep for about an hour. The next day my wife and I look around the area for any sign of foot print or the branches themselves. I didn’t find any sign of activity. We did find a grassy area with three large rock piles. Two of the piles were old and had trees growing out of the pile, one was newer with nothing but small vegetation growing on top. One thing to keep in mind is that the area is frequented by campers so there are few branches, especially large ones, on the ground for anything to step on; and there are paths all through the area and as we all know animals will always take the easiest route when traveling. Something else we thought of is Saturday we both went to the bathroom deep in the woods, we thought ""what if we encroached in their land?"". Before I was skeptical but now I know there is something out there and this experience has truly changed my life.",Uwharrie National Forest,Montgomery County,North Carolina,Fall,35.46955,-80.08778,10/25/15,50074,Class B,75.12,66.765,58.41,0.43,Mostly cloudy starting in the evening.

"Driving with family on Damascus Church Road in Alexander County I saw what appeared to be a Sasquatch.  I glanced over while driving at the top of a fenced-in cow pasture and I saw it.  It appeared tall over 7 foot and had long arms walking upright.  It had long hair all over that appeared all over the body and the hair must have been 6 plus inches.  It walked down a powerline clearing and veered off into the woods .  I was kind of in disbelief and told my family what I think I saw, turned around and it was gone into the woods.

"Leaving from Wilson Mills, NC ... I went to visit with my fiance and her family in Taylorsville / Hickory North Carolina on Oct 15 2012. On October 18th 2013 around 5:45 pm, I left to meet her and her nephews to take them to a Haunted Trail (For Halloween) after she got off of work. I left from their mobile home, and turned right onto Friendship Church Road in Taylorsville to get on 16. It is about 5 miles from their home on Friendship Church Road to Hwy 16. About 30 seconds after I pulled out of the driveway, onto the road, I looked into an open field on the left, they sell muscadine grapes (there is a dirt road that leads into the vineyard area) and about 30-40 yards off the road, and about 15 yards off of the dirt road/path there what at the time was a bear sitting on its butt, I saw it only for about 4 seconds while passing. I got down the road about 1/8 mile and turned around in a local church parking lot, when I got back, there was another vehicle turned into the dirt path, I slowed down and rolled my windows down, and the lady asked me ""Do you see that thing?"" which I didn't see it anymore, she then pointed, I looked, and it was walking on two legs into the tree line. We then spoke for a few more minutes, before I left. I told her I turned around to get another look. I knew then it was not a bear after I saw it walking on two legs like a human. I learned about the BFRO on Finding Bigfoot show on Animal Planet last night, and wanted to share my story.","I'm not familiar with the area all that well, but I do know it was on Friendship Church Road in Taylorsville, about 3 - 4 miles from Hwy 16 which I was heading to.",Alexander County,North Carolina,Fall,35.84103,-81.20877,10/18/13,43204,Class B,67.92,60.58,53.24,0.49,Partly cloudy throughout the day.
"While on vacation, my family and I were camping at Linville trailer lodge and campground in Linville North Carolina. On June 15th, 2010 we were all sleeping in our pop up camper. At 2:00 am I was woke up by the sound of an animal to the south east of our camper. Its calls were 4 short whoops followed by 1 double whoop. After listening to that for a couple of minutes I heard another one calling from the North West. Its call was 3 short whoops followed by a double whoop. While listening to that one, another from the North West started calling. Its calls were 2 short whoops followed by a double whoop. After a couple of minutes I could hear them calling and moving towards the north east. It sounded like they were with in 100 yards of our camper but I was the only one that got woke up. On June 17th we got ready for bed about 9:00 pm. around 9:30 pm I could hear the same calls as the second and third animals from 2 nights before, they were much further away this time. My 8 yr old daughter heard them also and asked what kind of animal makes that sound? I did not answer her.

"I live near Asheville NC. I own a landscaping & Irrigation company. I grew up about an hour east. My parents had 30 acres that was surrounded by 6,000 acres of game land. I've played in the woods, hunted, and camped my whole life. Plus my business also allows me to be outside year round. I was starting up a irrigation system in a large gated & wooded golf community in the mountains of Arden NC basically 15 mins from Asheville. This community joins Pisgah National Forest, approximately 300 square miles of forest. This was around April or June of 2016. I was standing in the back yard facing the control box which is attached to the house. So my back was to the woods maybe 25 to 30 yards to the tree line. And I hear this large crash. The same sound a large tree makes as it falls through other tree limbs when its falling. I turned quickly to see a massive Beach tree rocking back and forth. Leaves were floating down but no tree was falling. I've been in trees this size. I'm 6'2 250 pounds. There is no way I could make this tree rock like this. But i didn't see what did it. So watched for probably 30 or 45 seconds. Nothing happened so turned to finish my work. Then it happened again but a different tree. This time I knew something was up. Bears don't jump from tree to tree like that. So I walked to the edge of the yard and watched for a few minutes. No movement in the trees. The canopy is really thick here. The only way I could have really seen anything that was hiding would have been to walk to the bottom of the tree and look up. But I wasn't about to do that. So after a while I walked back to the control again but I walked backwards. Seems silly but I felt whatever it was it was watching me. When I reached the control I turned to face it. Then turned back to the woods again quickly to see if I could trick it or catch it jumping. But nothing happened. So I started working again assuming the show was over. Then it happened again, a third big tree was rocking after the loud crash. At this point I was freaked out so ran to the truck and left. Rescheduled the job. I've been in the forst my whole life. I've never been afraid in the day time. Bears don't do that. They climb up and down. Cats don't make loud crashes if they would have they would have run after the first one. What ever did this has to be huge. I couldn't make those trees rock if i wanted to. Plus it was watching and waiting for the perfect time to jump so I wouldn't see it. Bears here aren't that worried about being seen. They know they can't be hunted in those developments. You have to make them leave. This was something different. I wish I had the balls to walk to the base of the trees. But I don't. I was afraid. I've been training to handle myself. I always carry a gun. But this wasn't something I could handle. I just know .",I can't give the street or address.

I turned towards the figure but couldn’t see anything. It was entirely too large to be a black bear and definitely wasn’t an elk. I haven’t seen any at all this weekend. The figure was very black.

"On April 15, 2011 my sons and I were camping at Mahlon Dickerson Reservation near Jefferson Township, NJ. The temperature was approximately 52 degrees and the day was overcast. At around 3 PM the three of us struck out from our campsite directly into the timber. There was no overgrowth and the trees were still bare. This is the reason we didn’t take any of the marked trails in the area. The terrain is very rocky and over the next hour we hiked and climbed. Circling back into the camp area we emerged at the far end and headed toward the road that runs the length of the campsite. From our position on the road, immediately to our right would be the beginning of a two-way trail. The lower trail heads off and skirts the bottom of the mountain while the upper trail heads up it. As we got to the road I looked over my right shoulder (Why I did this I still do not know. In other words, there was no noise that I heard or any other reason I can think of that made me turn around). There, at the beginning of the upper trail was a tall bulky black figure. It moved from right to left. Its arms were long and swung in large motions as it walked. The head was dome shaped and very close to the shoulders. In fact, it seemed that it would have had to turn its entire body to look in any direction other than straight ahead.  It walked out of site rather quickly. I was completely caught off guard when I saw it. My very first thought was why is this guy walking up the trail wearing black from head to toe? That’s when it hit me that no one would. Sure there are hikers and mountain bikers on the trails but not at this time of year during a work day. In fact, we had spent the previous night here and were the only campers on the grounds. There had been no visitors to the grounds the entire day save one woman who came to walk her small dog. The next thought that ran through my mind was how big it was. It did not appear to be exceptionally tall (not eight feet tall anyway) but the sheer girth of the thing was impressive. It seemed to me that it could have wrestled a bear and easily won. I have to admit that it took me a few seconds to gather my wits once it had moved out of sight. Once I did I told the boys to stay behind me and we moved up to where I had seen it. Once we reached the area I looked to the right where I had first seen it come into view and got another small surprise. I had thought it was walking along the upper trail when I first spotted it. However, that trail began where I had first seen it. The direction it came from was an off trail wooded area. We did follow the trail for about ten minutes but I decided to abandon it and head back to camp when the kids got spooked. On the way back I had my 12 year old, 155lbs, 5’6” son stand at the top of the trail where I had first seen the thing while I went back to my original spot where I first saw it. Whatever I saw that day was an easy 12” taller and three times bigger around than my son. Those are the facts. Now, I have to add that my impression of this thing was one of curiosity. I had been having a feeling, not an overwhelming feeling but a feeling none the less, that as we hiked off trail that day we were being watched. I never felt threatened or perceived any danger or I certainly would have moved my boys right out of there. It seems to me that it had been watching us and once we had left its area and gotten back to ours it was more than happy to move on its way.",Mahlon Dickerson Reservation,Morris County,New Jersey,Spring,41.01941,-74.57013,2/15/13,29139,Class A,49.84,39.27,28.7,0.19,Light snow overnight.
Ok so I would like to keep this somewhat discreet because my family still to this day use what I told them as a joke against me and I don't need everyone in my town talking about me cause this just sounds ridiculous. This happened near Toms River NJ. Me and my buddy were on our way to a job in Browns Mills and we're traveling down route 70 which is known as the pine barrens. It was sometime between 6/7 am and about 7 deer came shooting out from the right side going left across route 70. I didn't slam on brakes cause it was like 50 feet in front of us but I stopped pretty fast and I kid you not there was a big hairy grey and brown thing that came running right up to about 3 feet from the pavement and it stopped and turned around and ran the other way back into the woods. Since I seen this I started watching that finding Bigfoot show but their videos and pics are always something black. This thing was light grey and brown and it was huge! I mean huge like 8 foot tall and big like fat big. It could not be a guy cause it had like hair all over its face! Like I didn't even see its eyes or lips or nose.  It was like hair for a face. We seen this thing at about 25/35 feet. I know it was real cause my man was like totally in sync with describing it to each other. It was all we talked about the rest of the way to the job. It was like what I was thinking he was saying and vice versa.  This was two months ago and that was it.

My husband and I were taking a woods cruise and were driving in the northern section of Brendan T. Byrne Forest on St Mary's road. It came to a dead end so we stopped to look around and there was a pond and a little path so we decided to walk our dog for a bit. We had only gone in a little ways when we smelled kind of musty mildew odor typically not smelled in the woods. This kind of freaked my husband out and he wanted to go back to the car. So we started back the way we came and then turned down Buckingham Whiting road. We drove this for a bit and came across a little bridge. We stopped because I like taking pictures of the water. After a bit we started to drive off. I am driving and in a split second I saw something brown on 2 legs and about 6 feet tall sprint behind the car in the area we were just in. I caught it in my rear view mirror. I was kind of thinking to myself that my eyes were playing tricks on me but I just couldn't shake it. I stopped the car and husband told me to go in reverse. As we approached the area he thought he heard branches snapping and a splash into the water. He didn't see anything so we drove on. We just kept talking about what I saw and if it was a bear a deer a person. I said it was definitely on 2 legs. It was quick and it was light brown but thin. We drove a little more and turned around and went back. On our way back I thought something was rubbing in my brakes because we heard like a wuh wuh wuh wuh wuh - we stopped and he looked under my car and didn't see anything. He thought maybe it was what I saw making a warning call.,,Ocean County,New Jersey,Spring,39.94853,-74.42721,4/7/18,59280,Class B,44.53,38.175,31.82,0.73,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.

I thought it was reflectors on the pole itself but as I grew closer I realized the size and stature of the figure. What I thought were reflectors were eyes and it took off into the woods.

"My brother and I camped overnight in High Point State Park, New Jersey, the other night. Driving around the park, the camping sites were labeled with numbers. We wanted to set up in a place as far away as we could from the other people. I myself, have known the existence of Sasquatch to be real for quite some time. Not from a personal experience which was yet to come, but because of watching so many people tell their stories of encounters, and just seeing the genuine fright and truthfulness in their eyes when they tell their stories. My brother however, always laughed at the subject of Bigfoot, and was a complete skeptic. So, my brother and I has set up camp on the edge of what I'm assuming was the only lake in the park. We walked through the forest in the daytime, and indeed found many peculiar structures and tree breaks I had seen before on Bigfoot TV shows. As night fell, we made a fire, and watched the numerous stars reveal themselves as the night got darker. Around 12 o'clock at night I went over to a rock right by the edge of the lake and looked up at the stars, while my brother tended the fire. I'm an astronomy fan, so before I knew it I had been sitting there for two hours when I checked my phone and it said it was nearing 2 in the morning. Just then my phone ran out of battery. While sitting on the rock, I began to feel a weird sensation that someone or something was watching me, I checked to see if it was my brother but he was staring into the fire. I dismissed this feeling and told myself I had just brought it on myself. I looked back up at the stars and got lost in some train of thought when all of the sudden, something made a very loud noise that could only be described as a very large man exhaling aggressively towards me. I jumped up and ran to my brother, and we heard the thing walk towards the forest, all the while breaking branches and continuing to make the same aggressive noise I heard so close to me. It got quiet, and my brother and I were standing looking in the direction where all the noise had came from when it made the noise again. Now, I don't speak Sasquatch but that thing was telling us to get the heck out of there. I don't get scared easily at all, and I was shaking like I never had before. I felt so much negative energy and decided I was too scared to stay outside, so we went to the car and sat inside, praying whatever made that noise didn't come back. My brother described the sound as sounding like someone ripping a tent. Whatever the noise was, absolutely no common animal could have made it. After a sleepless night, when it got light out again around 5:30, we built up the courage to go back where we heard the noise to see if there were any indications of what made it. And when we got there, I was shocked. There was a makeshift bed made from giant leaves that was fit for a very large creature. I could see the exact spot where the thing that had made the noise was watching me, and where it walked away, as there was a clear path of flattened grass and plants leading up the forest. The area was wet and muddy, and indeed there were footprints. But, as I was taking pictures the path leading from the bed to the upper forest, it happened again. The thing made the same exact noise, this time it was so close, I nearly fell. We ran back to our campsite and listened. But nothing made a sound. We stayed there for about 30 minutes until I decided to go back and see if there were fresh prints or anything I could take back as proof. I took more pictures, and i was standing on the trail leading back to our campsite looking at the pictures I had taken when again, the thing made the same noise! This time it was on the side of me that I would have to run past it to get back to the campsite. As soon as I heard it, it felt like my heart literally dropped and my legs became wobbly, but I summed up my courage and once again ran back to the campsite in fear. It was only about 10 seconds away, and when I got there my brother was standing there wide eyed asking if I had heard the noise. Whatever it was, it was not happy and we heard it walk up into the forest breaking branches and exhaling aggressively as it headed deeper into the forest. At this point my brother wanted to get the heck out of there, but I needed to see it. I went up to the road right before the forest where we had heard it go in, and looked around, but saw nothing. I was so confused on how the heck it ever got so close to me without me seeing or hearing it walk at all. While I was walking on the road, I saw my brother walk up from the campsite looking around. When he spotted me, he sighed in relief and told me he though I was getting attacked because he heard a bunch of human like screams coming from the forest. I walked towards where he was and started to hear them too, but by the time I reached him the screams started to sound like some kind of weird chatter. My brother, the skeptic, was so scared he told me were packing up and leaving right away. I have no doubt in my mind that we just happened to pick a campsite right next to where a Sasquatch was sleeping, and he was just not happy about that. I know what we heard was a Sasquatch. My brother entered a skeptic, but left a full believer in Bigfoot.","If you drive into High Point State Park, past the left turn and sign that says Park Ridge I believe, and keep driving all the way to main lake, keep passing campsites until you reach campsite number 19.

"I have not had a visual incident, but several strange experiences around my area recently have led me to try want to talk to someone who might know what is going on. Here I'll list the experiences: 1. I have a small orchard next to the forest in back of my house. 2 years ago, a young pear tree was bearing fruit for the first time, loaded with pears, there must have been 20-30 pears on it. I checked them one evening and decided that the next day I would come out and pick them. The next morning, I came out with a basket and every one of them was gone. Not only gone but every branch that had had a pear was broken. The top branches were about 10ft high so what ever took the top pears had to be tall. At the time, I didn't even consider a bigfoot and thought it might be a moose which we have go through the yard periodically. But I have not heard that moose eat pears and certainly not every one on the tree. Usually when deer eat my apples, they rarely eat more than 1/2 an apple at a time. Since that time I have put an electric fence around the orchard and the tree is recovering. 2. My workshop is down the street from my house, in my barn. About 1.5 years ago, I was walking up from the barn to the house and it was pitch black, in the evening. I could only barely see the road. Just before my house there is a patch of hemlock trees. As I passed the trees I encountered a very strong scent of wet dog. It had been raining all day but had stopped but everything was wet. The smell was overpowering and so strong that I stopped to see what it was. I peered into the trees but couldn't see anything. I walked past the trees and past the smell, walked back to the trees and the smell was still there. The trees are about 15-20 ft from the middle of the road where I was. I have to say I was a bit afraid as we do have some big bears around and didn't want to aggravate one, but I doubt a bear would have stayed still. My experience with bears is that they don't like being around humans and the ones around here are certainly not afraid of humans and usually just walk away. Whatever this was didn't move. So I went into the house. I definitely felt like I was being watched. 3. 1 year ago my wife and I were woken up around 1 am to the sound of a screaming woman in the woods, or what sounded like one. It was very loud, certainly louder than a woman would have been able to make, and it woke both of us up. After the screaming stopped, there was a pack of coyotes who yipped for a while from the same area. Then another sound of the woman screaming, then more coyotes, then more screaming and then more coyotes, then nothing. We went back to bed. We had heard the woman screaming sound before, years ago, in the middle of the day, and had gone out to find out what was going on but found nothing. We do have cougars here though and it may have been one of them. 4. A few weeks ago, at about 10 pm, my wife, myself and my son were sitting in the living room. It had been raining and foggy all day and was still drizzling out. It was pitch black and we couldn't see anything outside. All of a sudden, a rock hit the side of the house nearest the woods. It must have been about the size of a large marble. We immediately opened the door, but it was totally quiet and nothing more happened. 5. My daughter was visiting two weeks ago, and she was here for a week. She came on a Sunday and the next Friday she complained to me that she hadn't been able to sleep because of the screams in the woods. She asked me if I had heard them but I had slept through them. She said they were about midnight to 1 am and were accompanied by the sounds of a pack of coyotes. She described the screams but I of course cannot repeat them on this note, however, when she tried to repeat them, they are like nothing I've ever heard. She said they repeated for four nights. On Friday night, we stayed up trying to hear them but they did not reappear. 6. My daughter's dog stayed with us last fall for 5 months. She is a small black lab and loves to explore our field near the  woods. But many times, during the day even, when we went to let her outside, she refused to go out the door. She would sniff and then back away from the door. I still don't know why. Some days she would go out willingly, and some not. 7. The most recent was a few days ago. It was our first day above 90 degrees and I was traveling down Rte 31 north from Greenville along the Souhegan river. I was looking down the river on the right as the river arced away from the road and saw, some distance down the river, a large animal on all fours standing in the river.My first thought was that it was a bear. It was large, as the black bears we've seen around here are quite large. But it was cinnamon colored, quite a light color and the fur was at least 4"" long. I couldn't see its head. One of the bears here stood up against the screen door of my next door neighbor and my neighbor is 6'2"" and the bear stood as tall as he is, and I thought as I looked at this animal that it was at least that big. I know cinnamon is a variation of black bears, but the fur didn't look right, it was much too long and shaggy. The fur was so long that I couldn't see the joint between the legs and body. I should have stopped to get a better look but I was in a rush and didn't. 8. The last experience I had was in March. I was walking in the forest on a trail. In the distance, I heard someone hit a tree with a stick three times. I remembered that this is what bigfoot sometimes do from the online reports. I thought about that, and then walked on. About 100 feet later, it happened again. I thought, ""If this is a bigfoot, I don't want to meet him today"". I finished my walk without incident. So in sum, what is all this? Am I imagining something or what? Any suggestions? Do you have any similar reports from near here (southern NK)? I know bigfoot has been cited near here several times in the past in nearby towns.

"My wife and I were driving home from Denver, Colorado to Albuquerque, NM and stopped at a gas station in Las Vegas, NM (I believe it was a Philips 66) at approximately 0100 on 10/18/2013.  We pulled off of I-25 Southbound into the gas station parking lot.  When we were driving down the frontage road towards the gas station, we saw a few vehicles on the far end of the parking lot with 3-4 people talking and a NM State Police cruiser was leaving the lot, however, upon parking in front of the gas station, we discovered that it was closed.  I needed to pee rather urgently, so I ran around to the back of the station to find a dark place to do my business.  I walked about 15-20 meters behind the gas station to be out of sight of the occupied vehicles in the gas station lot.  As I was urinating I began to feel...uncomfortable.  I was peeing in open ground and initially thought somebody was walking up behind me (probably to do the same thing).  I craned a looked around and saw nobody and no animals; just a blanket feeling that somebody was very near me.  As I finished peeing, I turned and began briskly walking back towards our vehicle.  As I was hurrying back I turned to look behind me; and that is when I became a believer. Before I continue, I would like to preface my anecdote by alluding to my high-level of academic credentialing alongside my occupation as a healthcare executive.  I also provide executive and technical advise to elected and appointed officials; I have worked very hard to become an expert based on empirical analysis and studied fact.  I did not believe in Bigfoot, ghosts or another unexplained anomalies.  I believed in results, hard work and, well, results.  My perspective is now very different. As I turned and looked over my left shoulder, I saw an enormous, lurking animal.  The animal was crouched over, almost as if taking cover in the sparse and cold vegetation.  In fact, I think the creature watched me the whole time, and did not make so much as a noise.  However, the creature noticed when I saw it.  The creature stood up, and quickly lumbered into the dark away from the direction of the parking lot.  The one attribute of the creature that resounded with me was how heavy the footfall was.  It sounded like somebody dropping a sack of potatoes over and over again.  And it was fast.  I observed the creature for about 8-11 seconds, from the moment it realized I saw it, to watching the animal dart into the wood line.  Due to radiant light from the parking lot, I could make steady detail of the fleeing creature.  Here are the salient points from my memory (aside form the footfall): 1) The creature was approximately 8-10 feet tall.  I am 6""2 and this animal would have towered over me ( I observed it on flat land lending to my estimation). 2) The hair on the creature was matted, like dogs that live outside.  The coloration was dark brown. 3)  The creature had a defined gait.  It took strides that I would estimate to be 3-4 of my strides per 1 of it's strides. 4)  The creature had massive, human like hands. 5) The creature was very skittish, not moving until realizing I was observing it, lending to a higher intellect that a brown bear.  I believe the creature may have even fled in fear. 6)  I did not make eye contact, but noticed a massive brown and defined jaw and cranial structure. There is one other trait that I have since read about that may allude to this being a New Mexico Bigfoot.  The air was rank with what I thought was the dumpster behind the gas station.  However, this may be the ""musk"" eyewitnesses have reported in the past.  I cannot be sure, but it was very powerful, and somewhat reminiscent of what I perceived to be urine. This incident was fearful and moving.  I was unable to sleep for days and could not even bring myself to tell my wife until recently.  Due to my profession and reputation, I have extreme, extreme reluctance about openly sharing my encounter.  However, I have personal visual evidence of a so-called mythical beast, and I do not know what to do with it. Another fact: I have a concealed carry handgun license in the State of New Mexico and was carrying a 1911 .45 at the time of incident.  I was so scared that reaching for my weapon would have been an afterthought.  I was actually scared stiff.","It is the Southernmost gas station off of I-25 from Las Vegas, NM.

"I was traveling home from work in Gallup to Bluewater, South Side.  The time was about 8 p.m.  As I was traveling on hiway 612, right when I was exiting the sharp curves, I noticed a figure moving by the road on the right side.  I thought it was a very tall person at first but when I looked I noticed that it wasn't human.  As I got closer it started to cross the road and almost hit my truck.  It stopped and I did not want to stop because the road was ice packed and I didn't want to get stuck or run off the road.  I seen the creature a few feet thru my trucks passenger front window.  The creature's face looked ape and humanistic.  He was probably 7 feet tall because when he got real close to the vehicle I couldn't see his face.  He stood way over the truck. I was overwhelmed with fear at this point and just kept going home.","Just entering the Canyon, just past where the guard rails end.",McKinley County,New Mexico,Winter,35.37201,-108.2034,3/7/11,28964,Class A,47.91,35.72,23.53,0.09,Mixed precipitation in the evening and overnight.
"It was Saturday, July 16, 2011, about 12:30 a.m. early last Saturday morning. We were going to the Chuska Mountains on the Navajo reservation for a family reunion. We just left the main paved highway through Narbona Pass, Indian Service Route 32, Hwy 134, between Sheep Springs, NM and Crystal, NM. We went south on a dirt road, Indian Service Route 32, into the Chuska Mountains. we were about 5-8 miles into the mountains, when we came upon a small hill that curved towards the east, then to the south. As we approached the hill to go up, the road quickly turned right/south. As we reached the top, we saw the full moon and it lit up a flat green pasture that was on top of the hill. As we made the turn to the right/south I noticed a big black figure standing. As I looked at it, it stood with the full moon behind it, so that all I could see was a black outlined form. I kept my eyes on the figure while making the turn right. I said to my wife,  ""Did you see that?!"" She said, ""What?"" I said, ""Something is standing over there by the road."" As I looked, I noticed that the figure was standing by a small pond, which was about 10-15 feet from the road. I could see the figures reflection in the pond, along with the full moon. I would say when I first saw it, it was about 75 feet away. As we got closer, our headlights turned to the right, away from the black figure, but I still could see it, because the moonlight was so bright. It just stood there, still, as if it was waiting for us to leave. I told her I was going to pull the truck onto the edge of the road. The road being dirt, and because of the rain, it had been plowed, so there was a ridge of dirt on both sides of the road. So, I pulled the vehicle, left towards the ""Bigfoot"" to flash my headlights on it. As my headlights flashed the ""Bigfoot"" it turned. We could see the legs (two) turn, the arms (two) turn, and it started running away from us up a small hill into the trees. It was a quick smooth run, I mentioned to her that it ran, Ninja-like, smooth and stealthy. In less than 5-6 seconds it was in the trees. As it was turning and running, we didn't see any clothing, buttons shining from the headlights/moonlight, we saw a huge mass, a body running on two legs, we never saw any eyes. We noticed the legs and arms, and for sure it ran on two legs up the hill. We were about 30 feet away from it when it ran up the hill. We could see that it was not a bear or human. It stood at least 7-8 feet tall. It was wider and taller than a person. After it ran away, we were in shock, we sat quietly in the truck, still for about 15 seconds. Then, all of a sudden my oldest daughter, screamed and said,  ""Daddy what was that."" I was shocked that she was awake the whole time. I thought only my wife and I saw it. But, she was terrified, asking me, over and over, Daddy what was that. I couldn't say anything but tell her, it was a Bigfoot. My wife and I aren't crazy nor are we believers of Bigfoot until now. In fact, we were the biggest skeptics. But we can't deny what we saw. I have to believe it because it was real. My wife also admitted that she saw it too, as we first approached the hill, just like I did. She, just wasn't sure at the time if it was the same thing I saw. It was eerie and exciting at the same time. We also went back there on Sunday to look for tracks. There weren't any, the ground was extremely hard where it ran up the hill. Along the pond, we saw hoof prints from cows, dog prints, deer prints, no noticeably Bigfoot prints. By the way, the pond was only about 10-15 feet wide, it was just runoff of rain water, so it isn't always there during the year. It seemed to me, that it was not wanting to be seen. I believe if I didn't turn my headlights towards him it would have probably stood there until we passed by, then it would have left. I think it was very intelligent. Because it watched us. And even before I could get the headlights turned onto him, he had already started to turn away from us. It had to have known what we were going to do next. That is probably why we didn't see any eyes. I have lots of stories from my grandma about Bigfoot. She said they have been here since the beginning of time. And, that they were like us, living among us, until they saw ""humans"" start to fight among themselves. Then, they didn't want any part of us anymore, so they went into hiding. They, know that if they kill a human or make contact with one, they know that nothing good will come of it. So, that is why they stay in hiding.","We were on a dirt road, Indian Service Route 32, going South into the Chuska mountains.

"Summer of 2020 (quarantine year), in late July, I was hiking with a friend along Rio Chama.  Although we were just on the other side of the river from town, the railroad was not running, the campground was closed, and the majority of the town was empty. This was a short day hike as we are seniors. We had a dog accompanying us (pit bull mix) for part of the way.  Before we reached the river we had to return the dog to the car- she became unusually excitable and fearful. Note: my friend and the dog live up on the mountain, the dog is used to wildlife and has treed a bear before. Anyway, windows down and dog much happier, we returned to our walk.  We had crossed the river and was on the trail that runs by the bank when we heard a series of hollow knocking sounds.  These were loud and resonate, not woodpeckers or falling branches.  A short time later they were repeated at a distance- the knocks sounded lighter in tone, like a hit on a more solid wood.  The knocks close to us responded- and we decided that it was in our best interest to leave the area.","This is probably not accessible now- we were able to walk back to the area due to everything closed by COVID.

"I was camping one week and I went for a hike say around 12am about 3 miles from my camp site. I had heard some rustling around me and continued walking. I then heard what sounded to be a large animal about 15 yards away but it sounded like it was moving on two legs, not four. I had shown my light all around and did not see any thing. No glowing eyes like a deer, fox or coon. At that point I turned around and started to head back to my camp. I then heard walking again, I started to walk faster. Out where no one is around for miles and sounds like someone is near, it can scare you. The people I was with would not have followed me like that because they knew I had my knife and my flare gun with a .22 sub caliber fitting with me. A tree branch had then landed next to me, it was fairly large, with no other branches on it so it did not fall from a tree. I turned and fired the gun. Something ran away with a very large thud sound as it ran. It sounded like a very, very overweight person running, but it was very fast.

"On June 20th at approximately 6:40 pm I was travelling on Route 563 south of Chatsworth near the Franklin Parker Preserve speedwell entrance. I was looking to see what the parking situation was there for a future hike so my eyes were on the right side of the road when out of the periphery I saw what I thought was a ground hog on the left. It was very large and I realized that it would have to be a huge ground hog so I looked fully to the left and I saw an approximate 3 to 3.5' tall creature stand up on two legs as I passed by. I did not get a good look at the face and I almost continued but I decided to turn around about 150 yards up on a dirt road that's on the right. I pulled in and turned around and headed back to the location. There is a bend in the road there. It bends around to the right on the way back as I made it past the bend, approximately 30 yards in front of me the creature was still there. It was now fully turned towards me and I could see that it looked like a cross between Curious George and the character Chaka from the land of the lost. It's face and hands as well as the tops of it's feet were hairless and a light tan in color. The fur it was covered with was a golden brown a little darker than a golden retriever, very much like the color of a groundhog. I could not see the nose. Wen I locked eyes with it I could not see whites just big dark brown eyes. It stood there for a second or two when I rounded the bend and then took off running back into the swampy area. It ducked behind a short bush and when I drove past it I could no longer see it. I turned the car around again and when I went by again it was gone. I waited there a bit to see if I could see anything moving in the field. I couldn't so I took off. It was a couple days before I shared the experience with my family and friends. In that period of time I thought for sure someone was going to report a missing kid in a Halloween costume. When the thing took off running it was fast! I would describe it as the fastest kid on the 10-12 baseball team. We had really bad storms that night and my commute was a disaster. It poured all through that area and I thought it was odd that the thing I saw appeared to be dry, at least the fur was.

"At approximately 7 PM on Wednesday, November 16, Jon E., Dan F., Dan W. and James O. and I met at my house to watch a Philadelphia 76er's game.  While watching, Dan F. noticed a human-like creature walking in the street in front of my house.  From the living room window, we all observed a creature which appeared to be just under six feet tall walking away from my house.  The creature was about 150 feet away and passed under a street light, which gave us the ability to get a decent look at it.  It was long limbed, but clearly not human.  Because of the lighting it was in silhouette, but we could see that it was covered with hair.  It was walking with its shoulders hunched forward, and did not appear to be in any distress.  We watched it pass from view as it went behind trees and into the woods on the far side of the street. I live in a quiet neighborhood that is located in a wooded area.  My house is on a street that is a cul-de-sac, and there is very little traffic.  There is a quarry less than a quarter mile away through the woods.  In the 14 years that I have owned this house, I have routinely heard animal calls that can't be identified as dog barks, etc., and have seen droppings and footprints in the woods that have not been from any animal such as a deer, etc., that would be seen in this area. This is the first instance in which I have seen a creature that I believe is a bigfoot.  Because we were all shocked by what we saw, we did not attempt to pursue this creature, but we were able to observe it for 5-7 seconds before it passed from view. In the minutes that followed, we all discussed what we saw.  While my friends, who do not live in this neighborhood, were initially reluctant to acknowledge that it was a bigfoot, after I explained the things that I have heard and seen around my house over the years, we all agreed that the creature was not human, and clearly fit the description of a bigfoot.

"Visual Report: My name is Alan Y. on about Mid-November 2012 I had a very unusual experience that at first kept me very mixed up, but always stayed in my mind until I started doing research. It was about 2 to 3am in the morning. I awoke to go outside and have a smoke. The area of the town of Bath, NY is semi-rugged with hundreds of huge foothills. There is a vast amount of forest, lakes, ponds, wildlife and many state parks. Much of the land is posted ""no hunting"". The hills are super steep, so climbing or hiking is difficult. We rented the full basement apartment of a home. Our entryway was in the back of the home semi-underground. There was a deck over our entryway. I am an ex-US Army Intel (Special Tasking veteran) who served in central America and the Middle East. I am telling you this because I am a trained observer and weigh out everything I see. I am super aware of my surroundings. That morning I went outside and lit up a cigarette. It was very dark this night and cool. Deer would constantly wander through and many times I could be 10 feet from a deer and be silent so as not to spook them. As I lit up my smoke some movement caught my attention about roughly [140] yards directly in front of me to the East. A cinnamon brownish colored figure was pacing back and forth over and over. On each side of this clear cut there is a couple homes. This thing was at the far end by the next tree line pacing back and forth moving towards the last home and back again moving appx. North to South then back the other way. It was moving erratically pacing back and forth like it was confused or undecided if it wanted to go closer to the home. As I looked at first, I thought it was a drunk person? But in all the years I lived there, I never seen anyone out there. As I watched what really caught my attention was it looked like it was floating across the ground as there was absolutely no head bob at all. The ground rose between myself and this entity and went back down on its side so I could not see the lower legs good. It kept on pacing back and forth for about 3 minutes. At the position I was at under the deck, in the shadows, I was not observed by this creature. I’m not a afraid of too much, but for some reason the hairs stood up on the back of my neck and I got into what I call (combat mode). I wanted to bellow out at this entity (Ahh) but something said do not do that. Around 3 to 4 minutes of this pacing, I turned my head for a second and it was gone. I got a fearful sense of where this thing went and had a feeling it may try to flank me around the 2 homes, so I went into the house and awakened my wife and said “there’s something weird out there."" I did not think of ""Bigfoot"" right away, because it was not the Patty type I seen on the P&G film. I also thought that they are in the Northwest, not really here in New York State. It was I believe 6-7 feet tall, a slimmer build. Wide on top and slimmer than Patty. More like a fine-tuned athlete than a body builder, long arms and an awfully long shaggy head of hair (which stood out too me, WEIRD. The reason I even saw it was because there was a light on that home as he was pacing towards, that lit up it and some of the area.  Upon seeing it (after the fact), I realized that there was a hedgerow running parallel to it, and a large ravine behind that that ran into the woods. Across from this property was a road, couple mobile homes then a very step wooded foothill (small mountain). For years this baffled me, and I could not get this out of my mind until I visited the BFRO website and seen at least 6 reports entirely around my area.

"It occurred on a sunny June 17, 2015 around mid afternoon while we were boating along the eastern shore of Lake George, NY, just above the Narrows. The object we saw was located at approximately 43 degrees 35.086 minutes north and 073 degrees 34.347 minutes west per a Google Earth view obtained on 5-5-2015.  We were about 140 yards away (even though it didn't seem that far) and the bearing from us to it was about 132 degrees true, again using Google Earth to obtain distance and bearing.  This section of the lake is state property and part of the ""Forever Wild"" section of the Adirondacks.  There are many square miles of wilderness here and this location is only about 8 miles from the locally famous Whitehall, NY sightings in 1976. We were motoring in our 19' I/O boat northeastish in a narrow channel between Sarah Island, Hazel Island, an un-named rocky outcrop and the mainland.  Our intended goal was Fox Island, a short distance away.  We were traveling about 5 mph, slightly above idling speed, engine rpm would be approximately 1000.  There is a point of land opposite the rocky outcrop and as we cleared it, a small bay exists on our starboard (right) side.  Since I'm always scanning the lake side to side for boat traffic, at that point in time, I was looking to the east into the bay and I noticed movement close to the shoreline.  It seemed that whatever it was, was caught by surprise as we cleared that point of land.  I then got my wife's attention, she looked in that direction and also saw it. My view was of a very large black animate object that seemed to quickly raise an arm (?) from it's side to a horizontal position then turn away and move back and to the side (north) behind a nearby clump of coniferous trees.  I then spun the boat around for a better view.  Meanwhile, my wife (Debbie) was watching it.  Her impression was that it was large, dark, upright and didn't move like an animal.  Her view was slightly restricted by the trees but she did notice that the object was swaying from side to side.  The only (known) animal that is large and black out here in the Adirondacks is the black bear and we both strongly believe it wasn't a bear (I've seen many bears in the woods).  It was an observation of very short duration but long enough to impress us.  Unfortunately we can't provide any accurate dimensions or descriptions of physical details but even though we're not sure of what is was, we're sure of what it was not! We then continued on to Fox Island which is about 200 yards from the sighted critter and only about 50 feet from the mainland and chatted for a bit.  Eventually we got the charcoal grill fired up and proceeded to cook a traditional meal of dogs and beans, of course with the appropriate condiments.  We do this on a regular basis on the islands of the lake.  As we were eating, we both had a weird feeling so we QUICKLY finished our meal, loaded the gear back on the boat and left or as some may say, got the heck out of Dodge.  We've never had that type of experience on the lake before and are not sure if the two events are related.  I've recently become aware that some folks have a theory about how our favorite mystery creature may use/communicate with infrasound which could explain that feeling we both had. We returned to the area on July 6, 2015 by boat with my brother who is an accomplished photographer to investigate the mainland.  By then, the NYDEC had installed docks in that bay so we could tie up to and go ashore.  We went to the area where the critter was first observed and noted that there was a small, probably seasonal stream that flowed into the lake.  We searched for but did not find any tracks or other sign.  However I recently purchased a trail cam and plan to set it up in that area.  Preliminary testing has shown that the motion sensor is very sensitive and wind generated tree movement will trigger it.  I've got a few ideas on how to mount it but am still trying to come up with the appropriate ""bait"".   Got any ideas? Also this spring (2016), I shared our occurrence with BF researcher Bill Brann who runs the Northern Sasquatch Research Society who was present during a public screening of a documentary called Beast of Whitehall, The Abair Road Incident that was made by the Ohio firm, Small Town Monsters.  He then mentioned that he had a report of an anchored boat by Fox Island that had rocks thrown at it at night.  It was probably the same bay which is quite protected from boat traffic. Again, we both have had over 40 years of outdoors experience and are very familiar with Adirondack wildlife.

"This is a follow up to my original message as I wanted to add some significant insight to an incident that occurred to me in 1960 at age 14. As I stated previously stated I was a caddy at the time and the foursome I was with was just walking off the green of hole 13 on the private course Club in Syracuse, New York.  As I was walking across the green to replace the pin I heard something falling through a tree directly across from me. You could hear it pass through the tree as the boulder made its descent to the ground. The large rock almost hitting one of the golfers. There was much consternation over this and it was automatically assumed that it came as a result of blasting at General Crushed Stone located behind the golf course on Rock Cut Road. I never heard a blast but there could be no other explanation as large rocks don't just fall out of the sky. However, the rock being hurled into the air by a dynamite blast at the quarry just doesn't hold up in many ways. First off my friend's father worked at the quarry at the time and he said blasting was not large enough to propel a single rock that far as the charges used to quarry the limestone were not that great. Plus this was a single large boulder if it was a blast there would be a shotgun type of pattern of smaller rocks with it, not just one rock sailing into the air. Secondly, the rock that I saw was not a freshly quarried rock which would be gray in color this rock was a surficial rock that was stained from the soil it did not come from a blast site. The boulder was at least 20 pounds in weight and 4"" by 8"" and 3"" thick. It was flat on the top and bottom and stained a yellow brown color as is common of rocks on the surface in that area. However, this rock came down out of the sky vertically as you could tell by the sound of it falling through the entire tree, cutting branches and leaves as it fell it had to have been lifted quite high into the air to come down vertically like it did. It did not smash into the tree on a horizontal trajectory and bounce off the tree. As I stated previously at the end of the game I met up with my friend  who lived on Rock Cut Road at the time as we were going swimming in the spring fed wash ponds at the quarry. The way to get there was to go back to hole 13 and cross the fence into General Crushed Stone property. We were trespassing which at the time we didn't acknowledge.  We stopped and I showed my friend the rock that came out of the sky and both of us believed that it had to have been a blast at the quarry.  We walked on down a grade on a path and that is when we heard a guttural growl off to our left. It was a fearsome growl and I for one shot off down the hill as fast as I could go. We assumed it was an animal. However, what animal growls at a human when the human is not confronting it or even knows it is there? I don't know of any and I certainly don't know what type of animal living in Central New York would or could make itself know in a threatening manner. Normally animals of all type will shun and form of human contact or confrontation. This occurred no more than 100 feet from where the rock had landed under the tree. Plus if you were to place a clock face over the tree that the rock fell through and draw a line out from where the rock had landed which was between the 3 and the 5 those two lines would encompass the vicinity of where the growl came from. As I have stated I never saw anything out of the ordinary and was certainly not aware of ""Bigfoot"" or anything like it being seen in New York State. I had heard of the ""Abominable Snowman"" but that was worlds away. I can't say this is a ""Bigfoot"" encounter, however, two events occurred that is very similar to what others have experienced in Bigfoot sightings. The large rock being hurled at individuals and done so to scare more than injury plus the deep growl the likes of which I had never heard before or since and couldn't to this day equate it to one particular animal. The only thing I am sure of is two events separated in time by only a couple of hours still stand out in my mind these many years later as if they occurred today.",On the border of  a Country Club and General Crushed Stone behind hole 13 of the gold course.,Onondaga County,New York,Summer,43.00972,-76.10047,10/6/17,57998,Class B,66.18,63.83,61.48,0.53,Light rain in the morning.
"I was driving on a backroad in Rhinebeck, NY. I was heading to a rehearsal at the Rhinebeck Center of Performing Arts at about 6 :30 in the evening. The road is called Pilgrims Progress Road. While I was driving on this road, I passed a 20 mph road sign because it's a sharp right turn, but on the same road. The road is very curvy. I passed this turn, and in the middle of the road was a Hannaford bag with an open cereal box, and a log placed in the bag. I had to go in the left lane to miss the bag. As I passed the bag, something darted behind my car from the left. I looked in my rear view mirror, and saw this big, black thing right where the bag was. At first, I thought it was a bear because it looked like it was on all fours. I kept driving, looking in my rear view mirror. After a few seconds, it was out of my vision. I kept driving down the road until I pulled into a driveway on the right, and turned around to see what it was. As I got to the location where the bag was, I noticed the bag was missing. I kept driving for about 0.2 miles down the road, past the 20 mph sign. As I turned, I saw something walking on two feet about 50 yards in front of my car. It was walking on the side of the road. I could see that it was definitely not a bear. It was black, and it looked as if the hair was short. It's back was towards me, and the shoulders were very broad. It looked like it was slouching, and I couldn't really see it's arms. I don't know if it was holding something, or if it was the way it walked. I'm about 6'5"", and It looked like it was taller than me from what I saw. I saw it for a good three to four seconds, until it leaped up this little hill to the right. I sped up to the location I saw it leap from, and got out of my vehicle. I looked all around because there weren't many trees. The grass was very high though. I didn't see it after that. I was nervous, confused, and excited at the same time.","From the Rhinecliff Bridge heading towards Rhinebeck, go straight at the first light.

I started just before sunset, around 7pm. On my return trip down Corbin Hill, around 9pm, I heard a loud vocalization that I could not identify. It was a loud scream, lasting about 15 seconds. It started low-pitched as a howling ""oooooh"" sound, then got higher pitched as an ""aaaah"" sound.  It didn't sound like an owl or coyote, but more like a primate.  Based on my internet research, it sounded most like a gibbon's call, but deeper.  I heard no further vocalizations.

"Bigfoot Sighting Date: Early August 2010 Time: Approx. 8-8:30 am Place: Cascade Lakes, NY (near Keene) Weather: Clear with a few clouds I spend most of the summers camping in and around the Adirondacks in my Dodge Caravan. This particular summer I had stopped at Cascade Lake to spend a few days camping. I had slept soundly the previous night and had woken up around 7:00 am. I decided to get up and start making my breakfast. I had just started the kettle on the camp stove when I looked over at upper Cascade lake and could see the mist rising off the surface of the lake. I grabbed my iphone and walked about 50 yards to the edge of the lake to get a picture. As I approached the breakwall, I noticed a dark brown object on the opposite side of the lake at the shore. At first I couldn’t make out what it was but it seemed to be sitting at the waters edge. I then realized that it must be a bear. The animal looked like it was doing something in the water with its paws as I could hear a faint splashing sound. I thought it would be a good idea to get a picture so I brought my iphone up to face level and tried to focus in on the animal. As I was focusing in, the animal stood up on two legs. I was startled and pulled down my phone to see this with my own eyes. It took a step towards the treeline and stopped. Almost methodically, as it stopped, it turned it’s whole upper body to the left and stared at me for a couple of seconds. It turned back and in one step, disappeared into the tree line. I immediately went cold and got scared. As I ran back to my campsite, my only thought was that it was going to go left or right. If it went right it would have to go into the water and if it went left, it was headed directly for my campsite. I decided that it was best to get the hell out of dodge so to speak. I arrived back at my campsite in under a minute. My dog was still asleep on the front seat and didn’t stir at all. I opened the passenger side sliding door of my van and started to throw all of the camping gear back into the van, making quite a mess inside as I did. I closed the door and then jumped into the drivers seat and floored the gas to leave. As I was driving out, I kept looking out my left drivers side window to see if I could observe it again, but I saw nothing. I drove all the way into Lake Placid and parked at a mall parking lot to gather my thoughts and think about what had taken place. I was pretty shaken up as I kept replaying the experience over and over in my head trying to make sense of what I had seen. Observations: I could not ascertain its height exactly, because of the distance, but I would guess that it was approximately 7-8 foot tall. It was covered head to toe in shaggy dark brown hair or fur. I could see the sunlight shining off its back as it turned to go into the treeline and could see the brown coloration as it turned away from me. When it turned to stare at me, I could not make out any facial features but I knew that it saw me. The upper body was massive and stocky like a football players build. It had very long arms that went well below its waist. I could also make out what I assume were the shape of hands. It walked upright and paused before slowly turning its upper body to look directly at me. It stared at me for approximately 5-10 seconds and turned back to face the treeline. It took 1-2 steps and disappeared into the forest. I could see a couple of branches move after it went into the trees. It was then I decided to leave. I did not hear anything other then the initial splashing it made in the water with its hands when I first thought it was a bear. I did not return to the area until three years later with a friend to camp. Nothing has happened on subsequent trips to the area of Cascade Lake. I have had two other odd experiences in other areas of the ADK’s on other trips.",Cascade Lake,Essex County,New York,Summer,44.22388,-73.87529,8/6/10,64192,Class A,65.27,50.27,35.27,0.88,Foggy overnight.
"My friend and I finished preparing for a big outdoors event and we were sitting outside his home.  It was around 11 p.m and his wife and dog had gone inside for the evening.  Across the road from his house there is a large swamp that goes up to a small mountain.  Our talk was cut short by an odd scream about 75 yards into the swamp on the right at ground level.  I asked my friend, an avid hunter, what animal screams like that?  He didn't know but we talked that maybe it could be an owl or a fisher.  A few minutes later, in the woods on our side of the road, a large animal broke a lot of dead branches all at once.  It wasn't running but seemed to have just turned around in one location.  A minute or two later three owls hooted between themselves at treetop level in the woods behind his house.  The owls seemed to have been about 50 feet apart.  We commented about this sudden weird activity when something came from the woods and landed in his yard behind us.  We were still facing the road and didn't see the object but I assume it was something around the size of a baseball.  He doesn't have a manicured lawn and it would be impossible to know exactly what it was.

"I was driving home through the mountains, from a concert last night, on Route 8 in Hamilton County, NY and at 12:37 a.m. I hit a ""creature"" that was carrying a deer, with my car. My car is damaged from the hood to the rear by this creature and I know it is at the least injured and its DNA may be on my car. The speed limit was 55 and I was not able to stop in time. When I saw the creature, who was carrying a deer, about to step into the roadway I hit the brakes but was only able to slow down minimally before impact. I did not really believe in Bigfoot before last night and I am still shaken up and have not been able to share this story with anyone. I wanted to stop and see if the creature was okay, but I was scared out of my wits to stop and get out of the car. The creature was huge, at least 7.5 feet tall. I've seen drawings and such of Bigfoot, and this creature looked similar, but had white around his hairline, and his fur was dark brown, almost black. I'm shaking writing this and I am in such disbelief that this happened to me. I can't even report the accident to the police, and I don't know what I will tell my insurance company.

"During bow season I and my brother were hunting. We got into the woods before daybreak. As daylight was approaching the woods never got active. No animals or birds were heard or were visible. About 2 hours into the hunt, all was quiet. It was then that I heard a very loud wood knock. Startled the hell out of me. It was northeast of me in the swamp.

"My husband and I and three children decided to go camping for the 4th of July weekend at the Shawnee National Forrest Park in Ohio. We left on friday July 2,2010 and came home on July 6th. On July 6th at 4:00 a.m. in the morning my husband was awakened by a very strange noise and thought maybe raccoons were in our trash but then listened and thought that it couldnt be raccoons by the noise it was making. It sounded like it was calling the other one from the woods into the site. We heard the other one walking behind our tent and my husband started to yell ""HEY HEY GET OUT OF HERE"" and then they ran into the woods and it sounded like stomping.....we then knew it was something very very large. I got the kids and we ran to the car. We drove into Portsmouth for about an hour and half...we couldnt think of any animal that could make that noise or stomp like that through the woods. Maybe a bear but bears couldnt make that noise. So we went back to the campsite this was about 5:30 a.m. and my husband went up first to check it out....it was a liltle light out but not light enough to see into the woods... after he was up there for a little bit i went up and we herd something breathing heavy and then a stick was thrown at me and it made that noise again and we both ran to the car and just slept in our car. Finally when it was like 8:30a.m. we went up to the site and looked around and couldnt find anything missing and our garbage was ripped open but not spread out all over the place.....and my husband went up into the woods and found a pack of our raymon noodles that was opened but not eaten( i thought that was weird most animals eat anything).. So we packed everything up and left. Later that day when i was home i was thinking about the night before all this happened that when i was sitting by our fire i could hear something throwing stuff at our campsite and felt like something was watching us but i thought i was just scaring myself...but it all makes sense now they were watching us and finally came into our camping area the last day we were there!

"It was toward the end of summer in September 2011 that I had my sighting of a tall hairy bipedal creature. I went to bed around 9:30pm on September 5th and it was a warm summer night approximately 70 degrees outside. I usually don’t get much sleep as I get older and it seems to get worse the older I get. I had awakened at about 2 a.m. in the early morning of the 6th, I had decided to go outside and smoke a cigarette because I don’t smoke in my house. I proceeded to the living room where the french doors are located to go out to the rear deck on my house that is positioned on the S.E. Corner of my house. I walked out on the rear deck and I stood there just in front of the french doors where the ashtray was sitting on the hand rail and I noticed that the moon was mostly full and set in place and that the temperature was rather warm. I was facing my back yard and enjoying the moon light and I might have been there for approximately two to three minutes when I heard a low guttural growl coming from my left from the cornfield. I live on a dead end street and the property that is located beside me is a corn field that belongs to a gentleman that lives up the street. There is a single line of large pine trees that divide my property from the corn field and as I looked over to my left after hearing the growl I couldn’t see anything even though the moon was shining in my direction. I still continued to stand there and about one minute later I heard this low guttural growl once again. I proceeded to extinguish my cigarette and walk back into the house not telling anyone about what happened. The next night I went to bed approximately ten p.m. and again I couldn't sleep and had awakened about one a.m. and  I got up and headed out to the rear deck totally dismissing what I had encountered the previous night. I was standing in the same area again enjoying the warm night and the moon was only showing at about sixty percent but it was still bright and very little clouds that night. The same thing occurred again, it must have been a few minutes as I stood there and I heard the low guttural growl coming from the same area from my left. This time it seemed to be a bit louder and I looked over between the pine trees but I couldn't see anything but darkness. I originally thought it might have been a bear but after checking bear sightings I dismissed it because none  has been reported for my area. At this time I am getting a little nervous because whatever this was it sounded extremely large and seemed to have a large set of lungs. I proceeded back into the house and just as I entered through the door way my wife had gotten up and she was headed to the door to go out to the rear deck. I stopped her and told her about the growls that I have been experiencing that night and the previous night. She replies with “I know,I have heard them before” and with a look on my face I thanked her for not telling me. I hadn't went outside at night for the rest of the week because I had no idea what was lurking in the shadows and I didn't know if it was still hanging around. The next day I had contacted my oldest son and told him what was going on around the house and he said he could come over on Friday the ninth after work and we could check things out. Now it's Friday the ninth and I got home from work at about 5:30 that day and my oldest son was already at my house waiting on me. We proceeded to walk through the the tree line that connects to the south eastern corner of my back yard and it runs along the edge of the corn field and as we were walking through we started to notice strange stick structures that didn't make sense and it seemed to rule out something done by nature. We finally got to the end of the tree line and it meets a large field with tall grass that gets five to six feet high and part of it seems to be swampy and has some cat tails growing on the one side. The temperature that day was warm and sunny with very little cloud cover and no rain but the ground of the field still seemed to be wet and muddy and definitely a paradise for ticks. My son and I made it partially through the field and we stopped to look across the field toward the wooded area and we were facing the south eastern direction over at some crab apple trees that was located on the tree line on the other side of the field. We were standing side by side and out of my peripheral vision I noticed some movement out of the corner of my left eye at the edge of the tree line that was approximately two hundred feet from where we were standing. I asked my son if he had seen the movement as I pointed in the direction of the wooded area and he relied “No I didn't see it” I then said lets go investigate that and see what it could have been. It was about five fifty p.m. by that time and I didn't know if it was deer or anything else because I just saw the movement but couldn't tell shape or color of the subject in question. We finally made it through the field to the tree line and there was a small creek about three foot wide with very little water flowing through it and we also noticed a trail where the deer had been crossing that creek in that same area and it was heavily traveled because the tree roots were showing. We both jumped across the narrow creek and started to walk the deer trail which followed the edge of the narrow creek and I told my son that I was going to check the creeks edge for any type of prints because I know I had seen something move over in that area. My son elected to wait up on the trail while I was searching the creeks edge. I was looking on both sides of the creeks edge when my son alerted me and wanted me to come look at something that was odd to him so I proceeded up the small embankment and walked over to where he was standing. He said “stand where I am and follow the creek down to a large tree on the creeks edge and tell me what that is”. I looked down to the tree which was about a good three hundred feet and I noticed something dark that seemed to be squatting behind that tree but I couldn't tell what it was but I know it wasn't moving so I dismissed it as a log or tree stump. I went back to the creeks edge to continue looking for any type of prints in the soft mud but came up empty handed. I told him we should go into the woods a little deeper just to see what else we can find and I walked back up to the deer trail and just for curiosity I went to the spot where I previously stood to look down to the large tree where we both seen that dark object and this time the area looked different. We walked the deer trail which followed the narrow creek and had noticed the narrow creek tees into a larger creek that was about 15 foot wide but we didn’t see a good spot to cross until we followed it a little farther and we had found a shallow spot that we could cross. Once we crossed the larger creek we split up and I headed south and he headed north and I had been looking around for about five minutes and I heard him call my name and wanted me to go to his location. I walked over to where he was and he was standing in a small clearing that had the greenest grass I had ever seen and this clearing was surrounded by thick brush in the shape of a U. He had noticed an unbearable smell in that area and he asked me if I could smell it and I replied “Yes” but then I asked him what it was because we couldn't pinpoint what type of smell it was because it had a combined odor of rotten eggs and rotted flesh. We both started searching that immediate area for a possible dead animal or anything that could have made that nasty odor. We didn't come up with anything and it was starting to get about 6:30 that night so I told him that we should go but we can come back another time and he agreed. We went back to the large creek and crossed over and walked along the deer trail until we got about twenty feet from the area that we had originally crossed the small creek that took us to the field with the tall grass and he was walking in front of me he stopped and he was looking to his left and I asked what he was doing. He said “look” and as I looked over to my left I couldn't see what he was looking at so I asked him again what he was looking at and he pointed to his left and told me to look with a more stern voice but yet again I couldn't see because I had a tree and limb covered with leaves obstructing my view. I hunched down about six to eight inches to look below the limb and about 100 ft. from us we saw a huge hairy creature standing in a bipedal fashion with a forward gate staring in our direction. There wasn't much between us and this creature but some brush and small saplings and as we stood there in amazement because of the size of this human looking creature I asked my son what it was doing and he replied “It's moving its upper body back and forth” at this time I really don't think that it had set in to our minds what we were exactly looking at but I can say that it seemed as though time stopped and I have no idea how long we actually viewed this thing. We both just stood there and watched this thing and we never moved an inch because I think we were in shock from the massive size. This unexplained creature appeared to be at least seven and a half foot tall and had to weigh a minimum of six hundred pounds. The hair was a dark reddish brown and it had a matted and dirty look to it and most of the face was covered with hair but from what you could see it appeared to be of human trait. The ears were covered with hair and it was standing at an angle to us but I could see the legs were extremely muscular and large and the arms length seemed to go just slightly past the knees. I just couldn't help but to stare at this creature because I couldn't believe the size and just how big it was. I believe that as it was swaying its upper body back and forth because I knew that it knew that we were there but I don't think it knew what our exact location was and it was trying to find us as we were kind of hidden behind some brush. It seemed as my son and myself broke out of some type of hypnosis I looked at my son and said “we need to go”. He agreed and he said he was running but I told him not to run and that we would walk out but we can keep an eye and see if we were going to be followed. We finally made it to the small creek and jumped across and headed across the field with the tall grass as we kept looking behind us to see if we were being followed but didn't notice anything. We made it across the field and took a short cut through the corn field and as we both stepped into my back yard we turned around and looked in the direction of where we just came from and just slightly north of us in the wooded area we both heard two really loud tree knocks and my son looked at me and asked if I heard that and I said “Yes I did”. To this day I will never forget what I had seen that day and I will remember it like it was yesterday and nobody can convince me that it was anything else other than what we call bigfoot. From that day I vowed to become a researcher in the bigfoot world and my goal is to get enough proof of this creature so it can be recognized to mainstream science and documented so we can protect this creature and its habitat.",About 1/4 mile north of Route 30,Stark County,Ohio,Summer,40.79438,-81.31219,9/9/11,42745,Class A,75.94,69.345,62.75,0.42,Foggy until afternoon.
"Something heard. It was around 9:30 p.m. and a very dark night. I was unloading music gear from my truck in my garage. It was also particularly quiet. I first heard something that sounded like it may have been a man screaming. I stopped to listen, and heard it again much more clearly. It resembled the famous Columbiana recording, very very eerie. I recognized it because I was familiar with the recording from History Channel programs. I would describe what I heard as more like a roar than a howl, but still a combination of both. I estimate it to have been half a mile to a mile away. I was also able to hear it very clearly because of the quietness of the night. I'm certain that what I heard was not a dog or person or any other animal I could name.

"I saw Bigfoot from the chest up just below my house, it was in a wooded ravine below my house.  This was on June 4th, 2011.  It arrived there with a great deal of crashing and breaking down of trees.  I was looking to see what was coming when it stood up and looked at me.  It had greyish brown long hair, particularly over the face, wide set eyes, ears on the sides of the head, and a huge chest and shoulders.  It looked at me for maybe 1 minute, then went back down into the ravine.  Later that day it was making lots of sounds, like low grunts, my friend heard this as well. After that, it stayed in the Cuyahoga Valley area all summer, and I would often hear it calling, smashing rocks together, knocking on trees, and one day it sneezed a lot. Another day in September my cousin was using my large tractor to mow under the trees behind my house, and as I walked to my car from behind my house, I heard a terrific crash to my right, and there it was again, it had knocked over a tree and then I saw it run back into the ravine. I did not see any tracks, because since I knew it was down in the ravine most of the time I left it alone. It only recently seems to have left the area.

"I was on the Little Miami Bike Trail heading back to Morrow from Oregonia...mile marker 23.5. It was Sunday, April 12, around 5:00 in the afternoon. Since the Covid restrictions were enacted a week or two prior, the trail had became so crowded every day of the week. However a cold front came in and it was a cool, cloudy day and very few people on the trail...maybe 15 to 20 riders encountered from Oregonia to Kings Mill...well, maybe more, but not bad. I'm retired and ride this route nearly day, weather permitting. So, after passing under the former Jeremiah Morrow Bridge (I-71 over Little Miami river) there's a long gentle arc in the trail. I haven't seen a soul since I turned around at Wilmington Rd. I'm cruising, it's nice and quiet, when suddenly I heard a loud knock...so distinct I instantly said in my head...that was a knock! It came from atop the hill to the east. I pondered all the conditions, i.e; kids playing..not!, cold, remote, and they don't play in woods anymore,..adult messing...maybe, but how would they know I was there?... natural, very doubtful, I'm nearly 68 and never heard anything so crisp, clearly, like a Louisville slugger full speed against a barkless solid ash tree (I imagined). There...that's what happened. I look online to see if any Bigfoot sightings had been reported in this area and found none. I stored the incident away until last weekend when I was talking to my son. He's 46 in May, I raised him near Morrow (abutting the former Frisch's Farm on the 3-C highway). Our school district includes the Maineville area. One of his good friends lived on a hillside, at a 90 degree curve on Sibcy Rd. His friend, Chris Flick's older brother told Nick, 20 years ago, he and his dad both saw a Bigfoot walking through the woods on the opposing (their house) hillside...two different times. Nick said he never related this until he told me...because of my knock story. He said he'll never forget it...and because of his story, I tell you my story...There!

"It was on October 28th, a Saturday afternoon about 4:30pm. It was a clear sunny day when my wife and I were on our way down south driving on state route 19 South near Fremont, Ohio. As we came around a corner to a long straight away, we saw a tall brownish hairy creature walking from a field going east to west crossing the road. As I pointed it out to my wife we were probably about a quarter mile from it. As we watched while approaching it, its arms were long and swaying as it walked across the road in long strides. We watched it non-stop as we got closer to where it had just crossed the road. When we got to where it crossed the road, there was a guard rail and beyond the guard rail was a drastic slope into a heavily wooded area. We stopped and looked around but did not see anything around.

"I have never told this story to anyone besides my immediate family members because I tend to doubt myself. I believe there could be such things as Bigfoot, although I am not sure. I even went on an amateur investigation with my family last year in Salt Fork--we never saw anything but heard what we think were some other explorers whooping like us. I have hesitated to say anything because I don't want people to think I am making it up since I have been very vocal about my fascination with the subject to my students and friends. But seeing that someone else thinks they saw a Bigfoot near Meander Reservoir makes me want to tell my story too. Anyway, I am originally from the Youngstown area, although I live in Cleveland now. My husband, daughter, and I often travel to Youngstown to visit family in that area. On a drive home last year (it was in late March--the last time we went home before my father died) I swear I saw a huge figure standing flush with the treeline overlooking Meander. I was in the passenger seat so I got a decent look. We were driving over the bridge heading toward the turnpike to go back to Cleveland. The figure was huge--very tall and hairy. It was standing up and holding onto a tree looking out over the water. The location was among the trees along the bank closest to the bridge, if that makes sense. I'm not good at distances, but I was close enough that I could see it wasn't a person just from the massiveness of it. I have seen a lot of bears, and although some have been making their way into Ohio lately, it definitely wasn't a bear. I was in disbelief--I have always wanted to see a Bigfoot but I was speechless at the time it was actually occurring. I did say to my family ""I think I just saw a Bigfoot!"" but they didn't believe me. I talk about it once in a while, but since it happened so fast, and mostly since I had no clue it was possible for them to be in this area, I have convinced myself that I must have been mistaken. Now I don't think I was.","I-80 bridge over Meander Reservoir--heading West toward the turnpike.

"I I was going coyote hunting in North Lima on my in-laws property. I was grabbing my gear out of my trunk and through the treeline I could see about 5 turkeys in a field. About 50 or so feet to the left of them was what appeared to be an albino something, and it must have been sitting or lying down at time. By the time I was ready to get in woods the turkeys and that thing were out of sight. Upon entering the woods, almost immediately about 60 yds in front of me was this white fuzzy thing standing on 2 legs looking directly at me. We gazed at each other a minute at least and I began approaching. It wasn't intimidating. In fact was only at most 4ft. tall. It began backing as I approached and then soon fled. Couldn't wrap my head around what the hell I just saw. Tried to shake it off and kept walking. Within no time it just appeared again. About 60 yds. I tried looking at it better through scope but my hands kept shaking and didn't feel right putting a rifle up at something I didn't understand. I would get within 40 yds or so. It would back up. Then flee. Then popped out a third time. Got weird feeling of cat and mouse. Animals don't act like this. It was playing with me. I felt I was being lured into something.

"Through the years I have had several sightings and interactions with what appears to be a bigfoot and family. We own the better part of mystic woods in Columbiana OH. When the gas and oil companies started installing pipelines years back we started having encounters. I’m an engineer by trade and my wife is a banker. Tonight yet another sighting by our pond.  My wife and I were at dinner and as we arrived home about 8:30 PM a very large fast gray/ silver lite brown (covered in fur/hair) bigfoot darted from bushes in our front into the cat tails in our pond on all fours. We both looked at each other and said did you just see that?!!  The subject was down low and bent in the middle as it moved. Unlike a dog, it’s undulating movement was not as fluid as a dog. It was not a bear. It appeared to be from 4-5 feet at the back and torso built like a barrel.

"The whole thing was sparked because I had found an unusual barefoot track while out fishing with a friend. While fishing at night we have heard some very strange sounds. We went out hoping to hear something or find another track. We were sitting by the lake originally with nothing happening. After it being cool and a bit rainy, we decided to leave the area. We were going up the road when XXX made the suggestion to pull over by the archery field to see if we could see any deer on the way out. When we pulled over to the field we caught a glimpse of eyes. We stepped out of our vehicle using a large mag-light and we glassed the area where we saw the eyes and caught the eyes moving over the grass line. The thing that made me think this was strange was the distance between the eyes. They were about a foot apart and shined green when the light hit them. Then, it moved left to right and appeared to be just above the grass line which was roughly about four foot high. When it moved to the right is when it got interesting... It stood up straight and looked toward us. The eyes where clearly another 4 foot above the grass line. It then turned to its left and walked across the field into the wood line. We were all stunned. We decided to leave the area kind of in a state of shock...as we were kind of freaked out. We pulled out and headed out towards the road when XXXXXX said we should go back and get a size comparison. He said we watched it leave so we should go back for a more accurate comparison. It needs to be stated at this time that I am an avid hunter and was a Nuisance animal control specialist with the ODNR for three years. What we had seen at that point was nothing that should have been in this area. Not a deer, not a coyote, not a bear...this was much larger. We turned the truck around and pulled back into the archery area and made a general plan. XXX would keep the truck running as I would walk to the edge of the field with the mag-light. XXXXXX wanted to walk across towards the tree line to where we saw it go into the woods so we would get a height comparison. The truck lights were on....as XXXXXX started across the field, I was trying to glass the edge of the field with the light showing him which way to go. About 30 yards in or so the eyes reappeared in the same location it entered into the woods...low to the ground just above the grass line. I hollered to XXXXXX that it was back and he needed to go to the right. Once he started moving to the right, he looked back at the truck and said he could not see the eyes. He was looking back into the truck lights off and on. This thing stood straight up and looked down at XXXXXX. He was probably just about 30 maybe at most 40 yards from this thing. Jeremy is 6 foot and this thing just dwarfed him in size. I hollered for him to freeze! XXXXXX turned and looked at us, and I told him to move back to us slowly. XXX and I were honestly rattled. XXX was asking me what it is..what is it??…. as I was trying to rationalize what we were seeing. I had to answer him with a, I don't know??? As XXXXXX was walking back towards us slowly....facing away from us...all I could think was if it wanted him, we could never had made it to him in time. It stared at him till he was more than half way back and once again turned left and went into the woods. XXXXXX never saw the eyes. He said he did hear something moving into the woods...but it was faint at that point. We are guessing that it was around 8 foot tall.","The location of the sighting was near Spencer, Ohio.

"Hello, I am writing for my mother as she is not very good with a laptop. They live in Valley City, Ohio. She saw something last night that has really scared her and didn't know who she could ask about it. Here's a little background. Over the past couple months they have heard deep growls off and on but have never seen anything. They live in the country with a river and woods across the roads both in front and behind the house. They never go outside at night unless they can help it because it just doesn't seem right out, sort of like they are being watched. Then this morning about 3 AM my mom was in the kitchen making coffee and looked out the large window on the side of the house and saw yellow eyes looking in at her. As she had the light on in the kitchen, she couldn't see the full body, but the window was open and she smelled a musty skunk smell. This was the only window that the blinds were not closed. Needless to say the coffee never got made. It scared her really bad. She went to the living room and sat in the dark until it got light outside. Then when it got light she went outside and said it smelled like a herd of skunks had been around. The window is fairly high on the side of the house and I am about 5' 2"" and can barely look in the bottom of it. We estimate that where the eyes where on the window it had to be close to seven foot tall. She said her iris flowers and some other plants were smashed down under the window and all the corn for her squirrels was missing. She couldn't see any tracks because of the plants and the ground was dry.",Just off of State Route 252.

"Location, Nashport, Ohio, Near Dillon State Park. This is an account of events that transpired during mine and my friends 5 day hunting trip on a 40 acre tract in Nashport, Ohio, in Muskingum County. This land adjoins Dillon State Park, which is 2,285 acres of state ground. Both my friend and I are experienced woodsmen and hunters, in having been in nature our whole lives. We are confident in our knowledge of animals, their behavior, and calls. This compiling of events at times left us confused, awestruck and at a loss for words. We both went into the woods with the understanding that there are some things that cannot be explained or fully understood yet. However, we left our trip with a much greater understanding than we thought imaginable when planning this trip. 12/1/15 Tuesday Just after dusk. Light rain and no wind. We heard a large tree knocked over in the woods. There was no wind or outside influence that should have caused the tree to crash down. About 30-45 minutes later, we heard a second tree fall, which sounded larger. Around 8pm we began to hear tree knocks coming from 3 different locations simultaneously. The first 2 sounded like someone hitting 2x4’s together. The 3rd on the other hand was much louder. It sounded like someone hit the tree with a very large Louisville Slugger. Around 10pm, we heard what sounded like someone walking through the woods whistling. It was a human-like whistle, but we were the only people around. At about 3am, my friend stepped out of the camper to use the bathroom. Upon walking outside, he heard another loud tree knock from the 3rd location as before. 12/2/15 Wednesday We hunted all day and returned to camp. After dark, the tree knocks began. This time it was only 2 locations. Around 10 to 10:30pm we began to hear whooping sounds coming off of a ridge about a ¼ of a mile away. Still inside the camper, the sounds were so loud we could feel them. The whoops lasted 15-20 seconds without pause. Within 5 minutes we heard the call again, but this time the duration of the call was shorter. We stepped outside of the camper to get a better sound quality and then heard a 3rd set of whoops, this time so loud the calls could be felt in your chest. When these calls were finally finished the woods and entire area around us went quiet. Not a sound. Just as the night before we continued to hear wood knocks. Also noted we could hear something banging/ beating on cars in the junkyard below our camp site. At times it was so loud whatever this was seemed to be upset and trying to rip off a car door. The junkyard is inaccessible at night.  Just as the night before my friend awoke around 3am to use the bathroom and upon stepping out of the camper was confronted with a very loud knock from the same area as the night before. 12/3/15 Thursday The evening was quiet until about 9-9:30pm. Out of the blue, we heard a very long, very deep, aggressive almost tarzan like yell coming from the same ridge as the whoops the night before. This brought a chill down our spines it was so loud. It was long and powerful and lasted a solid 20 seconds. Trees knocks continued from the same areas as previous nights almost like we were being observed all evening. They were lesser in frequency on this evening however. About an hour later we began to hear coyotes yipping near the same ridge as all the calls have been coming from. There was an answer to the coyotes, which was similar but definitely not a coyote. The tone and pitch were different and it was much louder. It was very bone chilling to say the least. Shortly after this we could hear growling sounding like it was coming from just outside the camper. We loaded our guns and prepared for an encounter with whatever was out there. We stepped out with a bright flashlight but we could not spot anything. The tree knocks continued until we went to bed. 12/4/15 Friday Sitting around the fire around 9pm, we heard another tarzan yell, this time it was on a further ridge. Guessing around a ½ to ¾ of a mile away. It was long and as loud of a call as the evening before, just further off in the distance. It was quiet again until about 9:45. From the lake and waterway about a ¼ to ½ mile away, we heard a blood curdling high pitched scream. Also by the water way is a long set of rail road tracks that I wanted to note of here. From this point on we heard screams every 5 seconds. The screams progressively came closer and closer, moving down the creek bottom between the two large ridges. In no more than 30-60 seconds, the screaming had moved from the waterway again about a ¼ to ½ a mile away to what sounded like 100 to 150 yards away at the tree line. About 10 to 15 seconds later we heard what sounded like someone or something jumping on the hood of a car and over the 8ft tall (give or take) junkyard fence, clipping it as it went over. This was astonishing because in this 10 to 15 seconds of time this thing moved through 400 yards of heavy cover. I do not know of any person or animal that could do this that would also be responsible for these noises. A few minutes after all of this commotion, we heard the same blood curdling screams coming off the ridge behind us as all of the screams as the nights before. 12/5/15 Saturday We set up a two man deer drive for the morning down the same ridges and holler from where the screams the night before were moving through. Moving as quickly as possible, it still took me an hour to cover and navigate the same ground as the high pitched screaming the night before. We decided to check out the area around the waterway for tracks to try and confirm what we thought we had been hearing throughout the week. At one end of the spillway, the water had receded to depths of only about 4 inches. There were nearly 20 tracks coming from the main ravine and rail road tracks and into the shallow end of the spillway. They all enter at the same place but veer off in 3 different directions. The tracks appeared to be 14-16 inches in length, 3-4 inches at the heel and 6 to 8 inches at the toe. This creature appeared to have a stride of nearly or about 5ft toe to toe. My friend documented these as pictures on his cell phone. Upon further investigation we found more tracks 20-30 yards away in the sand on the bank. We took pictures of these as well. One set was slightly smaller but when up next to my 11 ½ size hunting boot it dwarfed my feet in comparison. We found another, larger track near these. This footprint was 16-18 inches long at least 4 inches at the heel and 8 inches or more at the toes. It was an older track but still stood out to us. We have a clear picture of this track up against my friends size 13 hunting boot and this track just swallowed it. These impressions sunk deeper than anything my friend or myself could recreate, and we are not small men at 210 and 185 lbs respectively. Investigating the bank line we could see multiple shellfish that had been eaten (potential secondary food source to all of the gut piles and wounded deer from gun season) There were no other animal tracks in the area that would have been known to be feeding on these aka raccoons. Also noted we noticed multiple footprints that looked to be from a child barefoot. These looked fresh. Why someone would let their child run around barefoot in December in cold water and mud is beyond me? Still not sure what to make of this. 12/6/15 Monday Upon returning home I spoke to my girlfriend about what had gone on during our hunting trip and finding the tracks and she was mind blown and interested. Since the tracks were on public land and deer gun season was over I know it would be safe to take her down to the water and show her the tracks and let her see the area. First I took her down to a sand bar to show her an angle I had at a nice deer on Wednesday. When we got down there she said wow bigfoot. When we looked down there was a fresh set of tracks in the 14-16 inch range very similar to the other ones noted already. They were so fresh you could see where the mud had squished up between its toes.  She took pictures on her phone with her feet next to them as reference. I then took her over to the sandy bank and showed her the tracks my friend and I had found to get a second set of pictures. Upon getting over there we found another type of track. It was roughly 14 inches in length but appeared to have severe hammer toe and or arthritis. It was roughly 4 inches at the heel and roughly 8 inches at the toes. We took pictures of this track as well. When exploring near the wood line I noticed how a very large creature had been moving through there. I found a large impression in the leaves. I began to remove them to get a better look at what was below. We found what appears to be very very large footprints. These were between 20 and 24 inches in length, well over 5 inches at the heel, and 10 to 12 inches at the toe. A picture was also taken of this impression. Upon seeing these the feeling of being watched began to overwhelm my girlfriend and we quietly left the area. At the end of this trip we left with some astounding experiences and a sense of shock. However, we both feel this is not a series of coincidences or random actions. Given our encounters and physical evidence which we were able to document, we strongly feel there is one explanation Bigfoot. Being experienced trackers, we feel these creatures are using the railroad tracks as a highway to come and go with minimal trace. Our interactions this week led two outdoorsmen who are very comfortable in uninhabited woods to sleep with loaded guns within arm’s reach. Each of us there will think twice before staying or wondering near or in nearly untouched woods at night alone. Although we did not get a visual, we fully believe this creature is large, athletic and completely in its element in the woods at dark.","Just south of State Rte 16 off of 146, North of Dillon State Park",Muskingum County,Ohio,Fall,40.01209,-82.13298,12/1/15,50393,Class B,58.61,49.165,39.72,0.7,Light rain in the afternoon.
"My husband and I have been hiking a local trail system in our area nearly every day since we got our dog in 2013. Over the years we have experienced several instances of wood knocking and did not think much of it in all honesty. More recently we have stumbled upon small trees (4-5 inches in diameter) that were twisted/broken in ways that a human could not achieve (in our opinion). All these instances combined over the years have not really made us feel unsettled or afraid, nor did we think it was anything too worthy of note; however, our most recent experience, which occurred over a period of a few days in September 2020, was unexplainable and I cannot go without reporting this any longer, as it has truly been bothering me since it occurred.  In September 2020, my husband and I were on an evening hike (approximately 4:30-5:00 pm) at the Stone Church Horse Trail System, which is a part of the Wayne National Forest in Shawnee, Ohio (Perry County) when heard what we can only describe as a “howling/roaring” sound. The noise occurred twice, and there was approximately a minute of silence between the two “howls/roars”. Sadly, I was unable to get my phone out quickly enough to record the instance, as it all happened so fast. My husband and I have never heard anything like it before. I was a bit unnerved by the sound and we quickly left the area and headed back home. We spent that night looking up the calls of animals native to Ohio, but none of the sounds we listened to even remotely resembled the sound that we heard that evening. A couple of days later, we went back out to the same trail system where we heard the noise. We stopped along the trail to allow our dog to get a drink of water. My husband was preoccupied with the dog, and I was just taking in the scenery. I happened to hear some rustling on the ridge above us, and when I turned to look, I saw what I can only describe as a very large, bipedal creature, walking between the trees and brush. The creature was far enough away that I could not make out its features specifically, but it was very large. It had dark colored fur/hair, dark brown or black in color. I cannot give an exact height measurement, but the creature appeared to be approximately 6 ft tall—This estimate is based upon our survey of the surrounding trees where the creature was sighted on the ridge. I called for my husband to look over at the creature, but it disappeared over the crest of the ridge into the forest before he was able to see. Additionally, more recently, specifically, February 13, 2021, at 4:57 pm, I unintentionally recorded a wood knock while recording video of my dog. This instance also occurred on the same trail where my husband and I heard the howling/roaring and I saw the bipedal creature in Sept. 2020. I do have that footage, and the wood knock can clearly be heard.","Directions to the General Stone Church Trail System Campground, as per the US Dept. of Agriculture’s website.

10 of us rented a cabin in the woods Thursday Oct 29th thru Sunday Nov 1st. It was located in Logan Ohio part of Hocking Hills area. Everything was normal till Friday. We all started smelling a nasty smell couldn't figure out where it was coming from. Didn't smell it in the cabin just outside. Late Friday night after midnight 2 people were on the deck and everyone else went to bed. They started hearing loud noises like branches breaking and felt like they were being watched. Sometimes it sounded like something was being thrown they thought it was one of us pranking them. Then came a loud bang near them so they ran in the cabin from the upper deck. The one guy came into my room and told me what was going on. So me and another girl went down to the kitchen area and we all started looking out the windows. I turned all the lights out. Within minutes the one girl yelled there it is. I went to the kitchen window and in the field right in front of me there stood a large black figure walking on two feet towards the cabin. We all started yelling what is that. It then all of a sudden turned and went back into the woods it came out of like it heard us. We then got everyone up we all went out on the deck and heard weird howling sounds that none of us have heard before. And loud noises like branches breaking. Then we heard the loud sounds in front of the cabin to the left. We all moved to the front and heard walking and branches breaking and seeing something moving around.

"On a summer day in 2013 or 2014, my dog (a miniature Italian Greyhound) and I were driving on back roads. I parked my car and was going to walk to the top of the hill. My dog, which travels with me, wouldn’t get out of the car which was very odd. I walked to the top of the hill and was looking down the gravel road ahead. At first I didn’t notice the creature. I started to turn when I caught movement out of the corner of my eye. When I turned my eyes back on the subject, I noticed it turning. It took a few steps and disappeared into the treeline. I saw the creature from the side. It was being about 7-foot-tall. It had gray hair. The body was very thick and its arms hung to about its knees. I couldn't see from his knees down. I didn’t notice any odor.","I was at the top of Buckhollow Rd. at the intersection of a unnamed logging road just to the south of Swift Creek Rd., approximately 25 to 35 feet higher looking south down Buckhollow Rd.

Going fishing last year at Mogadore Reservoir off Ranfield rd. Late night around 1am in the morning we had caught a couple of catfish. A 7lb and a 15lb. My truck was parked roughly 20ft behind us. Throughout the night I heard tree knocks and calls not common to the area. When we heard a few getting closer we decided to leave. When i went to the back of the truck where we kept our gear and the fish the 7lb catfish was gone. We looked around the truck and area to see if it had hopped out and saw nothing. While searching my partner was hit on the chest with a small rock leaving a half dollar sized mark. We packed up and left fast since we felt very scared at that point. I came back to the location a a couple of times since then and noticed trails and branches that were twisted and snapped that couldnt be done by normal means.

I tried to follow the noise but it was gone in seconds so I headed back to my truck on my way back a buddy I was hunting with said he found a very big foot print it was in a foot of grass but one print pushed the grass down to the mud and you can see the print he was tracking a deer and found the print.,1/4 mile north on 127 from 725 left on Summer Rd.,Preble County,Ohio,Fall,39.65361,-84.66399,11/15/12,40315,Class B,45.16,35.97,26.78,0.07,Foggy overnight.

"Was driving to my fiancé's house with her in the car at around 6:30 PM. We were heading east bound on 36 when we both witnessed in our headlights a shadowy figure sprint across the road from north to south. When I say sprint, I mean like a 100m dash sprinter or faster. It was about 30 yards or so in front of our car with another car coming from the other direction. It was probably 20 yards from the other car. I asked her, ""Did you see that?"" I told her that I saw a figure run across the road and I could see its legs. She responded that she did see a shadowy figure run across the road too, but was not able to notice any more than that. It all happened so fast. I use to watch the Finding Bigfoot show a lot, so we spent the rest of the car ride asking questions, explaining observations and possibilities. The location as described below was from a lot of parked cars surrounded by trees on the north side of the road to the south side of the road along the west side of the old farm house heading towards the big fields in the back. From my perspective I was able to see the figure because of the on-coming cars headlights. It was a black shadowy human like figure. I could see 2 humanoid legs for certain and it definitely wasn't a deer or anything on all fours. It seemed to be rather tall, but I didn't see any more than legs and body. If the car coming my way had been a truck I might have seen more. I believe it made it across the road in 3 steps judging by what the first 2 steps looked like. It seemed like it was sprinting very fast. Because it was dark out and we were driving 55 MPH, in the snap of a finger it was gone. We did not stop and investigate. Upon driving through area the next day, I noticed a 5-6 foot ditch on the south side of the road and figured out that's why it had to be sprinting so fast so it could jump over the embankment.","Address on the nearby mailbox is XXXXX, State Route 36, Knox County Ohio.",Knox County,Ohio,Winter,40.36462,-82.24197,1/5/18,58853,Class B,11.27,3.37,-4.53,0.63,Foggy starting in the afternoon.

I was a vender at creature weekend at Salt Fork State Park on May 4th. And at 9:45pm a fisherman that was in a tournament came in all shook up and said at first I thought you were a bunch of nuts until now so he started to tell his story to other venders. So this grabbed my attention so I went over to listen and there were about five of us that decided to go out the next morning at 6am to check out the site. So I got there at 5am and waited and said to myself if they are not here by 5:30am I'll start without them and maybe they will catch up with me. So I started to head down the sagebrush trail and headed to where he got the picture. The wind was from my left to right and the sun was on my left shoulder and half way down the path two deer must have smelled me because they were on my right and started running. So I kept walking and the sun started to come up and when I hit the first turn on the Shadebush trail I heard something like talking on the ridge on my left. At first I thought it was Friend A and Friend B with Friends A's black shirts on. So I hit a tree and yelled hey guys wait up then they started to walk faster and I yelled very funny guys this is when I got a great look at them. Then I knew what I was looking at on the ridge it was two bigfoots and they were black and huge. I tried to catch up with them and get a picture these things were walking fast and once they got to the bottom of the ridge they took off into the brush but I did manage to get one good picture. You can see in the picture the one turned to look to see if I was still trying to follow them. When the one turned to look back he had to turn his whole top half of his body with his left arm going a crossed his chest to look back at me. I tried to follow them but once they got in the brush I could not hear or see them. But I got a great look at them they were black as coal and the hair length was as long as a bear and well groomed.

At about 1 am she woke me up in terror because it was outside our tent just feet from our heads pulling handfuls of grass. She was frozen with fear and waited for it to walk away. When it did she opened the tent where she heard twigs cracking and shined the flashlight in that direction when she saw its really big yellow eyes. They were close together and it turned towards the wooded tree line. We believe it watched us grab our stuff and end the trip early. We left our tent and hauled it out of there fast. We are completely traumatized over the experience and would like to talk to someone who believes.

"What myself and brother in law found was a structure built of mainly blackberry vines. We were scouting for deer on an abandoned farm in an area that had been stripped for coal 35yrs prior. Deer were plentiful, but not as much as present day. When came across it when we both were following a path that materialized and split in two directions around a spoil bank. My brother in law went one way I the other, both paths lead to the top of the spoil were we came on the structure. We were in total amazement noting it was kind of an igloo shape with an opening to enter. The briars where woven together to form the walls and the inside had been cleared like it had been mowed. We stood amazed at what could have made it. We had never heard much about a Bigfoot at that time. Nobody in they’re right mind would have been in the area fighting thorny vegetation and biting insects to create such a thing. Than about a month later the same brother in law and his cousin were walking out of a hollow near dark when they heard the strangest animal they had ever heard. When they would try to tell the family about it they got laughed at. Neither ever forgot it  or entered the property in the dark. It wasn’t until maybe 20 years later when I happened on a Bigfoot program showing such a structure that a bell went off as to what we’d saw.

"I was at the back waters of Clendening lake near Cadiz, Ohio with my friend Cj and we heard a man-like scream. I know what coyotes, hoot owls, cows, raccoons, opossum, fox and most local animals sound like. We heard this scream about 3-4 times from multiple ranges. The first was within 100 yards and the next two were fairly distant. Cj answered the scream and the nearest location returned the call. After about five minutes of silence we returned to fishing. About five minutes later we heard a loud splash that resembled a dense object landing in the water. I've heard ducks landing and beaver tails slapping on the water and these did not resemble that. It happened about four more times, so we decided to pack up and leave. On our way out we stopped where the path to the fishing area met the road.

"I had two experience's with what I believe to be the Grassman in 2007. The first encounter happened on a strip pond. We took a boat back to a spot along the high wall to where there was a flat spot to camp. We set up camp, fished, cooked, and then went to bed around 11 PM. At approximately 4 AM, I was awaken to heavy footsteps walking down over the near vertical high wall. It approached the tent and I heard heavy raspy breathing. After a few seconds, I cleared my throat. Then to my amazement, it cleared its throat mimicking me. At that point I started screaming I had a gun. My friend would not wake up for some reason. I finally calmed down some and could hear it walk down to the water. Once there, I could hear it sipping water out of its hands. After that, it walked back to the tent, sat for a minute then walked back up the hill. The next morning we found 18 inch tracks right on the edge of the reeds. About two weeks later, we were walking to a boat that was on a pond about a quarter mile away. Then, I saw what looked to be a ten foot stump with two eyes watching us. I told my friend and he blew it off as just a tree. So we went out on the pond and after a while we smelled a strong wet dog and feces smell. After that, we started to get scared so we went back to the spot where the boat was kept.

"I was 17 years old and fishing on a boat about 25 feet from shore. My father was with me and decided to take a nap on the deck of the boat. Suddenly I heard the sound of footsteps walking through water. It was a unique sound because it was a very distinct ""caploosh Gloomp"". ""caploosh Gloomp."" It sounded like when I have walked through knee deep water in the past. Then, I heard a roar like nothing I have ever heard before. It sounded angry and a bit like a lion. There was splashing and then the sound of a squealing animal in distress, followed by more splashing and more roaring. Immediately, I started looking around in all directions but could not see anything. The sound was so vivid. I felt I was in danger and that whatever was harming this small animal was going to harm me and may even jump in the boat. Paralyzed with fear, I used the quiet electric trolling motor to get as far away from shore as I could with creating any disturbance. I woke my dad up who was napping and he heard the tail end of the encounter and instructed me to immediately start the motor and get out of there. We headed back to the marina and went inside to get a snack and drink. We had not known what we had encountered or if anyone would ever believe us. We were discussing the incident between us. Just then, a man behind the serving counter asked us what was wrong and could sense the fear in our faces. We told him of our encounter and he did not seem to be surprised. He told us that a few years ago a news crew showed up at this lake to do a report on a ""Bigfoot"" sighting. Until that time neither my dad or me suspected a Bigfoot, nor had we heard of anything like it. From that point on, I have been convinced that it might have been. In my mind I ruled out a short or four legged animal because of the sound of the distinct footsteps in the water. The aggression of the splashing and roars could have only been made from a large animal. One thing to note is that the woods and forest surrounding the lake are very, very dense and have often commented to my dad that it would be very difficult to get onto the shore. I have told this story many times and have been ridiculed.

"Last night I took my dog out and at about 2:45 AM. While we were outside, he seen something that scared him so bad that he drug me to the house. He acted as if I couldn't get the door open fast enough. When we got in and I got the door shut, he turned quickly and stared at the door as if whatever it was, was going to come through that door and get us. He is an Irish Wolfhound and he was very shaken. So, after I took my son to school that morning, I decided to look for tracks in the snow to see if I could find out what it was that scared him. This is when I found some unusual tracks, lots of them, like the ones we had seen on our property a year ago. So I took video, and a couple of still shots. And then I called Jim Thompson to come and look at them. ",,Harrison County,Ohio,Winter,40.30527,-80.93864,2/16/20,62549,Class A,42.92,32.46,22,0.79,Heavy rain in the afternoon.
"My cousin and I were leasing hunting land in Harrison County, near Scio, OH. It was on or about September 4, 2010. It was approximately 9 AM and we were clearing our four wheeler trails. The birds were chirping, squirrels were jumping, and wildlife was moving around. Suddenly, we noticed that all woodland sounds had stopped. It was very odd to us, so much so that we both stopped what we were doing and stood motionless. As we looked around, we saw a tall dark figure approximately 50 yards away standing behind a large tree. It was approximately 8' tall, with hair covering its body. It was standing upright and was looking out from around the tree. At first, we could only see about 1/2 of its face and part of its shoulder and left arm. We were both armed with pistols, which we quickly had in our hands. The stare down lasted approximately 30-45 seconds. I asked my cousin in a low voice... ""are you seeing what I'm seeing?"" He replied yes in a somewhat shaky voice. I said ""what is it?"" He said ""you know what it is"". We both knew it was a Bigfoot. A few seconds later it ran perpendicular to us. We got glimpses of it crashing through the thick brush as it was moving small trees out of its way. It ran completely upright. We saw it running for approximately 50-60 yards before it disappeared into the swamp. Even though the hair was standing up on the back of our necks, we slowly walked over to where it crashed through the woods. The small saplings it ran through were completely broken and bent over. We could not wait to get out of the woods so we fled the area. We did not see it again that hunting season, but made sure we were always well armed, even during bow season.",Bower Road and Beaver Dam Road,Harrison County,Ohio,Fall,40.40611,-81.13733,2/29/20,50856,Class A,31.58,24.855,18.13,0.2,Partly cloudy throughout the day.
"I worked on a dairy farm between Deersville and Tippecanoe, Ohio in Harrison County during high school. It was March, 1982 about 5:00 in the morning. There was a heavy frost on the ground, a full moon, and I could see fairly clearly due to the moonlight. I went to the outside paddock area to feed the replacement dairy heifer and started dumping the grain into the trough attached to the board fence when I heard a low grunt. The kind of grunt that someone makes from being in one position too long as you stand up. When I looked up, this figure was in the process of standing up. It was on the other side of a small creek that ran through the paddock approximately 50 yards away. The figure was standing next to the wooden hay feeder. It stood there for a few seconds then walked towards the other end of the pen closest to the woods. I only saw it for about 5 to 10 seconds but could hear it walking for approximately 30 to 45 seconds. I heard the sounds of footsteps crunching in the frost as it moved to the other end of the pen and then heard the squeaking sound of the fence being pushed down. The cattle were not spooked at all during this encounter and continued to eat. After we were finished milking, I went over to the hay feeder and couldn't find any prints in the ground as the frost was gone. The figure appeared to be approximately 7 feet tall which I estimated was a foot taller than me.",,Harrison County,Ohio,Spring,40.30824,-81.24778,3/4/20,35079,Class A,53.61,39.845,26.08,0.33,Partly cloudy throughout the day.
"My name is Christie Sproull, am 39 yrs old. I live in Scio,Harrison Co., Ohio. In the summer of 2011 My friend was staying in a tent in my yard for about 2 months. She said she could hear something big walking toward her tent. Then one night i was in the house on Facebook around 2 am and my girlfriend was on her laptop in her tent on Facebook. She messaged me to come outside right away that something was sniffing loudly and breathing heavy walking around her tent. I walked outside thinking she just was freaking herself out thinking she was hearing things. I kind of laughed it off, open the door and yelled if she was ok. She yelled for me to come to the tent so I grabbed a flashlight and walked down. I didn't see anything. If there was something there it ran away. I told her it was a deer. She was not convinced. In the summer of 2012 both of my daughters, 16 and 17, came in the house after taking our dog out around 11 pm shaken and scared saying they seen something really big once standing by our tree in the back yard which leads to the woods. Then again walking to the house up the driveway around midnight came in scared and said they had seen the same thing walking around our pool then walked into the woods. I never really believed them. I tried to convince them that there was nothing there, that it was there imagination because they overheard my friend talking who camped in my yard. I told them the dog would bark and growl if something was out there. Then on Nov.27th, 2012 around 11:45 pm I took our 5 month old pup outside to go do his thing. I walked out the door turned right with the pup on a leash toward the wood line maybe 20 or 30ft. from the door. As i started to get closer, maybe 3 feet away, I heard something big shuffling in the briers. I turned thinking it was a deer. When i turned around it stood straight up. It was very big, very tall, very wide. My guess would be at least 7' tall. Very broad chest which was all I could see besides the outline of its body. It was very dark and it blended right in with the darkness except the chest or stomach, not sure which, it happened so fast. As it stood up that part of it was light it showed in the moon light. I screamed very loudly and ran to the house dragging the pup behind me which I don't believe the pup even realized it was there. It scared me so badly I was shaking and crying. My husband and 21 yr old son, who also did not believe the stories from my daughters, and my friend, went outside with a small flashlight and a knife for protection to try to find out what it was. My son said it was still out there and that it was behind the tires wing. He seen its shadow and it ran from him toward the spring on the hillside which is nothing but briers. He said he couldn't see it after that but it was there because it quit running but he couldn't see it or hear it. He had this eerie feeling it was staring right at him. They both came back inside my son had the same description as me very very tall, very, very wide but he only seen the back of it as ran up the hill into the briers. My husband thinks it was curious, whatever it was, because it snooped around but ran away.  I truly believe that it was a bigfoot. It was hanging around for over a year that we know of.","we live behind the school right before you get to the skating rink. which is right on city limits line, in North township our yard is at the wood line of the forest. scio is on St.RT. 151 and ST.

"I stopped at a Nature Preserve to hike. On my way in, I had passed at least 14 people at various ways on their way out. I had walked down across the bridge and was looping back and it was about 4pm, As I was rounding a bend, I heard something big run away in the woods. I thought I had scared a deer and continued on. This is when I rounded the bend and saw a print on the trail going the opposite direction of whatever I heard scamper away. The ground was hard and the print was only about 1/4"" in the dirt. There were no other people prints or anything on the trail, As I'm taking pictures, something crashes in the trees above me... I covered my head waiting for a big branch to fall on me. After that, I high tailed it out of there. I left passing another half a dozen people on their way in as I made my way out. I never expected or was looking for anything on such a populated path.

My husband and I were walking a trail at Rockbridge State Nature Preserve. We stepped aside to let some fellow hikers walk through and I happened to notice on the other side of the trail (off the trail) an almost perfectly shaped large footprint. I showed my husband and we were stunned. We took the time to take some pictures and continue on. About 15-20 up the trail was a small tree that was broken in half and bent down. It appeared to be a fresh break and considering it was so close to the footprint we thought it was odd.,The print is located up the main trail just as you start into the woods.

"Hello, I live in Millersburg Ohio. On June 21st 2012, I was driving home from a nearby town called Loudenville on state route 39 going east toward Millersburg. West of a very small town called Nashville, on a straight away in the road, I saw something on the side of the road. I couldn't tell what it was for sure but thought it might be a man walking there. As I neared, whatever it was crossed the road (from left to right) a ways in front of me. What was weird is that I could tell it was there, but it seemed to blend into the woods, so it looked like a dark figure. It only took only three steps to cross the two lane highway. I slowed down as I passed the place it crossed and looked to my right where it had gone. By then I was almost stopped. When I looked up on the bank there was what I thought a man walking in the field...but as i looked I saw it was very big, and hairy. I thought it may be a hunter....but no clothes, no gun. I could see the hair shimmer as it walked. This thing walked like a man. It never turned around but kept on walking toward the tree line...it had hair from head to foot...it swung its right arm as it strode away and seemed to be unconcerned that I was there.  I got really scared that it might turn around so I drove away to the town of Nashville and called my son. No one believed my account until months later when I stopped at the farm where the field was...I told them what I had seen and assured them I wasn't crazy or a storyteller. To my surprise I had been the third person to come to them with almost the same account...they asked if I thought it could have been a bear....""No, beyond a shadow of a doubt....NO"". There is a game trail coming from the left where I first saw it. And one of the people who saw it went with the farmer to investigate but didn't find anything. I know what I saw...I keep journals and wrote it down the day after the incident.",SR39.

I was walking through a field while deer hunting and noticed odd tracks in the snow. I knelt down for a better look and noticed that the tracks had toes like humans do.

"I have two things to report: 1) I think I saw a bigfoot 2) A few weeks later, I think I heard it Where do you start making a report about this?  All I can say is that after what I saw and heard, I have to support the other person that made a report because I have to back them up. In mid May, 2013, I was returning from Buckeye Deli in Nashville Ohio on a deserted back road, (TR211 on my way to CR22).  It was early dusk because I wanted to get some cigarettes at the store before it got dark.  I stopped for several minutes to take pictures of some horses on the side of the road.  I was listening to live Grateful Dead,""Two From the Vault,"" on the Ford Expedition's CD player. I was enjoying thinking about being off work from traveling this summer, and appreciating this beautiful place that we call home.  The road is very scenic.  There is a canopy of trees which makes it cool to drive through in the hot summer.  The road cuts through a hill on the left and a ravine on the right. There are no guard rails and it is a dirt road. You don't travel this road in the winter if it is snowy and icy.  There are a few houses and farms nearby but mostly it is just wooded and remote.  Just locals for the most part go by every now and then.  So after several minutes of nature watching, (I have three photographs), I decided to go forward and as I put the car into gear, about 250 feet ahead of me I saw a big black creature leap from the hillside into the ravine.  I said outloud to myself, ""What the hell was that?""  I made a mental note to watch for deer, as we all do around here, but then I got thinking about what I saw. It was definitely black or dark colored.  Since it was filtered light I realized that it couldn't be a deer that was sillhouetted dark, because the sun wasn't right for that. There was a cover of trees. I went back another day at the same time and confirmed it with my brother-in-law and husband. So after I saw it, I got nervous because I believed that I may just have seen real sasquatch! I have seen the TV show a couple of times, but didn't really think about it much.  I drove forward to where I saw whatever it was cross the road, (arms / front legs in the air, big body lower, leaping into the woods), and didn't see anything after that. I can't say how big it was.  It fits the profile looking back in my mind now.  I remember at the time thinking at first that I saw a deer, and that it was a very big deer, (the kind that people would be proud to get around here in season), and that I should watch out on my way home. Then I started thinking about what I saw, and knew that it wasn't a deer.  I have to admit going down the road a bit that after a cursory glance, looking for whatever I saw...I kind of wanted to get the heck out of there.  I called my sister-in-law on my way back to tell her that I think I saw a sasquatch, (she likes to joke about sasquatch stuff).  She can verify that I was a little shaken up by it.  I was still reeling when I got home a few minutes later, still on the phone with her, and reported it to my husband.  After a few minutes discussion, he said that it was probably a bear, which I was OK with. I thought about it for awhile that night and went on to other things.  After several days, (it was still on my mind), I decided to look online to see if there was any other reports out there for Holmes County, Ohio.  After a google search, I found BFRO and read the report from June 2012 for that very same area!  That blew me away because we are in a very rural area in the middle of nowhere.  What were the chances of having a report HERE!  So I started to think that maybe it was a sasquatch.  I sent an e-mail to BFRO and got a call the next morning from the Ohio investigator.  He sounded very credible to me, and while I was rushing around getting ready for a job interview, I had to tell him what I saw. He blew me away when he told me that there have been several reports from my area in the past 6 months.  Now I was really concerned that this might be real.  Word went out to our family about my possible squatch sighting, and this past Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, my brother-in-law came down for a visit because everyone else was out of town.  So the three of us re-traced my steps down TR211 about the same time of day so I could verify that the light would not make a deer look black.  I have the three pictures of horses from where I was parked when I saw it.  We matched up the area and took another look. We stopped where we thought that it crossed before the bend in the road, looked over, and noticed that the fence was bent.  There was no fur stuck to it. There was a black thing on it but we didn't think it was fur.  Maybe I should go back and look again! lol My brother-in-law said that the area looked squatchy.  There was a canopy of trees, hills, a stream, wildlife and seclusion. Here's the best part of the story... On Sunday of Memorial Day weekend a few weeks after my sighting, we made a big warm bonfire because it was in the mid 30s and we wanted to be outside to celebrate the unofficial first weekend of summer regardless of the cold. My husband went to bed, and my brother-in-law and I decided to turn off the music and listen to the night sounds. It was about one o'clock in the morning. There is a lot of wildlife around here.  It was then that my brother-in-law let a really good squatch call rip, (like you hear on youtube).  And wouldn't you know it, we got a similar call back!  I looked and him and he looked at me, like did we really just hear that?  So he did it again, and sure as sh-- it came back even louder and clearer...then it trailed off.  I just about died.  We're like no way did that just happen!  I noted the time 0138.  We both said that it was one of two things, either someone else was messing with us, (there are campgrounds not too far away on the Mohican River), or it was a sasquatch.  I looked down the road and the distant neighbors did not appear to be out,  not surprising because it was really late and really cold. We heard it from the same direction on TR211 where I saw something a few weeks earlier. It was 35 degrees out and no one would be howling from a crowded campsite.  The calls definitely came from the general direction of Nashville. I can tell you that it did not sound human and was totally creepy!  Up until that moment, there were no answers to previous calls.  We had been having fun with it earlier in the day practicing our squatch calls.  But the two of us, without a doubt, heard those two calls.  It sent chills down our spines, and we know what we heard.  I made a new rule, that if anyone wants to call squatch, that we have to have tape rolling on it. We have lived here for 14 years and I have never been afraid of any animal life around here when I sit out late night watching the moon and the stars on our porch or by the fire. I am a night-owl and enjoy staying up late, sometimes until sunrise. It's a nice time to think, and to enjoy my beautiful surroundings when I don't have to get up early in the morning. It's an amazing place here in Drake's Valley as the original locals call it.  We call it home now since 1999 and never want to leave, even if there is a bigfoot nearby! Although I have to admit, this whole thing kind of freaks me out and I don't want to be scared of my surroundings. You move here for the glory of it all, not to be afraid of it.  Maybe this place just became more amazing to me and I should embrace it. This old farm house has been here for 138 years and we are surrounded by wilderness. You can't spend any time away from here because the wilderness will start to take it over, (squirrels, racoons, cardinals, wasps, mowing lawn for hours, cuyote, bees, birds, moles, tics, deer, bald eagles, fox, muskrat, cats, rooster, heron, hawk,snakes, grouse, geese, duck, bullfrog, possum, rabbit etc). We have it all down here...and now we have sasquatch possibly! My husband and I know that we are guests in these animals' home.  It's our home too though.  Somehow we will learn to live together...and maybe even communicate. In any case, I saw of glimpse of something and I heard something.  What it was / is, I don't  exactly know.  By the way, as I am typing this report, which takes a lot of guts to submit, on our porch two days after hearing the squatch call, with no music on, just sitting here enjoying the evening quietly for about 4 hours now, I just heard something at 0102.  It was a big tree knock!  SERIOUSLY!  Figures that would happen right now. If I hadn't started doing some more research, I might not have paid much attention to that type of sound.  I do pride myself on being able to idenify every night sound around here when my music isn't playing.  That one that I just heard was a real tree knock!  It sounded as if someone took a tree and banged it on another tree. I only heard it once now. I recognized it immediately from audio clips.  That was not too far away from me now!  I just called my sister-in-law.  It was in the opposite direction from where we heard the call Sunday. Maybe it's waiting around to see if my brother-in-law came back. There are 189 uninhabited acres from our back yard to the Mohican River. I heard it at 0102 in that direction.  I know all the sounds around here, and that was a darn tree knock. I also have to say that on Sunday, my we were playing Ohio squatch sounds on Youtube and I got a chill and said, ""I have heard that sound before.""  I just wrote it off to cuyote, peacock or ferel cats.  I am usually playing music, but my first thought is that I have heard that sound before.  A cuyote cry, (or maybe a sasquatch cry), comes in over the music.  You hear a lot in this valley. I have found renewed motivation to send you this report now.  I don't know what is going on...we're just regular people.  I am not drunk.  And lol, I don't think that I am crazy!  You wanted description, so I wrote an epistle as my dad would say. :)","Take SR514 from Buckeye Deli in Nashville, right on TR211. Sighting was just before TR466.

"I saw a shadow of a beast, about 50 feet away from the edge of the field.... It was around 9:47pm and a few people went away from our camp fire to an open field to see the milky way. A dense fog had appeared over the higher field flowers and tall grass behind our camp site. As we were gazing up, I took time quietly to assess the landscape just under and to the left of my view of the big dipper, and over the fog in the open field. My eyes had adjusted to the night and a shadowy figure of a huge being started to appear. It was dark against the fog. It was in the middle of the field and looked to be standing, leaning forward on its left leg. There were no trees casting a shadow, there were no lights to cast a shadow. It gives me goosebumps to explain it. I was alarmed but was afraid that my friends were playing a joke on me, because it was my first time at the farm, to camp with them. I have been camping before and nothing has ever scared me other than spiders. I tried to point out what I was seeing. I didn't yell, but firmly asked people to look at that and ask what is that?. But they couldn't see what I was pointing at. It seemed that nobody was paying attention to me. At that time I decided to leave the group and head back to the fire out of my own fear and wanting to feel safe. They followed me, I felt a little bad I left my friends but they didn't seem alarmed and were actually wanting an encounter. We sat by the fire and heard coyotes howling, for about 5 minutes then they abruptly stopped. I was afraid to go to bed until my tent buddy went with me.

I have had 2 experiences the first was in hunting season of 1995. While hunting with my friend out of a double tree stand my friend and I was waiting for our dad's to drive out the woods to us. At the same time a friend of ours was coming from around the opposite side of the hill. When he got to us we started to talk while waiting for our dad's to come through the woods. While we were talking we heard a very loud powerful scream come from the woods across the field from us. We had no idea what this could have been. Out of the three of us that witnessed this none of us had heard anything like that or wanted to go investigate what it was. We were scared even being armed with shotguns. Later we heard the ohio bigfoot recording howls and we agreed that it sounded identical. So we believe that we heard bigfoot years later. The second incident happened in the fall of 2002. My best friend and I were working on his wife's car and needed parts and it was getting late close to closing time for the parts store. So we took the back road to save time. While going down the road we came around a turn near the old coal mine scales and the headlights hit a bigfoot standing on the shoulder of the road. I slammed on the brakes and slide past it on the gravel road. I put the truck in reverse and looked at my friend and said did you see that? He looked at me wide eyed and said yes please keep going. I put the truck back in drive and drove off. We were quite shook up from the experience.,1995: Near Weems road train station 2003: Near Mingo sportsman's club,Jefferson County,Ohio,Fall,40.29771,-80.75612,8/14/20,49653,Class A,89.08,78.735,68.39,0.86,Clear throughout the day.

"We live in a cabin just outside of town with a swampy bottom that contains lots of trees and deer. In 2010 was when I had my first experience with something very large. Unfortunately, I couldn't make out what it was, but it had chased me several feet before I got into the cabin. In 2011, I had my first sighting of a creature that was about 8 or 9 feet tall, with brownish black hair that contained some grey and red streaks. It had been raining earlier that day and it appeared to have long stringy hair, deep set eyes, and very broad shoulders. Then in 2012, when my daughter was painting the benches at the fire pit in the far corner of our property she came running onto the porch white as a ghost. My husband asked her if she saw a snake and she replied she thinks she seen what I had seen a year earlier. She explained it as a reddish color beast of some sort. On May 23, 2014, our four year old grandson was spending the night. We were outside earlier letting the grand kids light their sparklers when the four year old said he seen something. We went back into the cabin and started watching television. A little later he said to his pap and then myself while we were watching television, ""did you hear that growl?"" ...we replied no and he ran to the back of the couch to look outside our large picture window. A few moments later he replied there's a gorilla outside and then started describing the same thing I had seen. His mother and I have never mentioned anything about our experience in front of the children before because we didn't want to scare them. His older brother was so afraid of his description that he made us close all the blinds and lock all the doors. The next day, we asked him if he remembered anything from the night before and he replied, ""you mean the gorilla."" We asked him to show us where he had seen it. Once he showed us the spot, fear instantly came over me to know it was just a few feet from the window. I called my parents because they are the property owners and they went out and bought two game cameras to put on the trees.  Since then, a three to four feet section of our firewood that is stacked around the fire pit was pushed inward. Considering it was pushed from the woods inward and there's about a four foot drop behind the woodpile it was quite concerning to us. Finally, on May 25th, our granddaughter went out with us to sit on the porch and cried out dog... dog and looked overcome with fear. My husband grabbed the flashlight and saw something take off running. He then ran around the cabin to see what it was and it had already crossed over the bank at the property line. All he could see was two red glowing eyes.",The northern edge of Bethesda off of State Route 147.,Belmont County,Ohio,Spring,40.01983,-81.07013,5/23/14,45215,Class A,65.66,55.53,45.4,0.83,Foggy throughout the day.

"In mid September 2017 at approximately 1:00 am while taking a small dog out I heard a scream that sounded as if a woman was in some kind of trouble. It was very loud and blood curdling. At the same time, I had a larger dog in the yard, and as she heard the scream immediately ran out of the yard and wanted inside. I did not stay out and went back to bed. I live in a rural area three miles outside of St. Clairsville Ohio, with plenty of homes, but also a significant amount of hilly wooded area with creeks nearby. The sound came from an area that is very woody and hilly situated below my house towards the town of Barton, Ohio. Behind me is about 120 acres of open space that has homes on it. Each lot is five acres and borders the hilly wood area. The homes have all been built in the last five years and for 30 years the property was used for corn and hay. There is an abundance of deer in the area, as I have counted 30 in one viewing. Also, the area has turkeys, but around September, I noticed that they were not around. I once counted upwards of 60 turkeys in one sighting. Also, coyotes are frequent and their barking can be heard often. A couple of days or so later, as my wife and I were taking a drive, she told me that she had taken the dog out at about 1:30 am, she heard the most god awful scream that scared her. She said that when she got back to bed, she could not fall asleep as the scream bothered her so much. She did not wake me as we both worked the next morning. I told her that I had also experienced the same thing the night before. In mid October while sitting around a fire in my back yard with two other couples with music playing, I heard a faint howl. I asked the other couple if they believed in Bigfoot and my friend said he thought they might exist. My wife and relayed our stories of the screams. At that point, I asked my friend to come up on the deck. I had kept two 4 by 4's on the deck and I did three knocks. Within 30 seconds, we heard two and one half howls. The last howl stopped half way through. My friend's comment was ""that was not human"" The friends stayed another half an hour or so and I stayed out. Over the next 45 minutes, I heard an additional three howls. Over the course of the next three months, I did knocks every week, but heard no responses. Over the past, I had occasionally heard other sounds from the woods, but thought nothing of them. On January 20, 2018 as I took my dogs for morning walk around 10 am, there was snow on the ground for a few days, five or six inches and it was starting to melt. Within 50 yards or so of my normal walk area, I noticed tracks in the snow that I had not seen before. The tracks were headed to a nearby neighbor's residence who always has corn out for the deer. The tracks were rather deep in the snow and had just began to melt. I could see two different sets of tracks, one larger, the other slightly smaller. I could also very clearly see what I thought was more like ""footprints"". There were deer tracks also in the area. At that point, I felt fairly sure that they were from a bigfoot. The tracks appeared to be three toes and were distinct. I did take several pictures on my phone. After walking the dogs, I did a Google search on three toe bigfoot tracks and found it was possible. My son was home visiting, he lives in Atlanta and we went back out to the prints. The snow had melted a bit more and I could now see more than three toes and was able to see five in some prints. My son was in awe and he agreed that they were not human, deer or bear. The tracks were primarily in front of each other and the two separate animals had walked fairly close to each other. We took more pictures. My son wears size 17 shoes and the prints were larger than his shoes. We took a picture as comparison. We were able to trace the prints back and the prints came out of the woods, went through the vacant grassy lot. All told I would guess we saw 300 yards of prints. During the previous night, I slept in a room that overlooks the area. The room has plenty of windows and my dog was sleeping in front of one of them. At 4:30 am, she started growling and growled for 45 minutes. She did not bark, but she did wake me up with the continuous growling. The next day, my son went into the wooded area and did find a couple of tracks in the muddy area that showed two prints similar to what we saw in the snow. He did take pictures. That night, we did a few knocks around 8 pm, but no responses. Additionally, on February 13, within 20 yards of the January prints, I found two sets of prints again after a 7 inch snow fall. I am comfortable stating that there were two sets of prints and I could see toes in them. They came within 20 yards of my fence and then circled back. My wife and I do discard bread, apple peels into that area from time to time to find the deer. In summary, I have watched enough Bigfoot TV shows, read enough about them to feel comfortable with what I have heard and seen. Although, I am no expert, I have not been able to humanly explain the events. Additionally, I am well educated and have been an executive in banking for 40 years.",,Belmont County,Ohio,Winter,40.10975,-80.85938,1/21/18,59078,Class B,49.71,46.595,43.48,0.14,Foggy in the morning.
"On the evening of April 7, 2020, we decided to do a little catfish fishing at a creek off of Piedmont lake in Egypt Valley. We backed our truck up to the water, dropped the tailgate, built a fire and started fishing. This was around 9pm. The moon was so full we didn't need a lantern. It was very still and quiet out until we heard a few coyote's howl followed by some frogs croaking. Across the creek was thick with brush and small trees, there was a path that looked like led down to the water. While sitting on tailgate, we started to hear a sound of something walking down the side of the creek. You could hear it slowly taking what sounded like a two beat step. Too heavy for a deer, and too small for a coyote/cat. It hesitated at the pathway, then continued on to the left of us. It then made a loop to the right and came back up only farther away from the bank. Then we heard a hoot owl like sound very close to where we first heard the brush cracking. Then another hoot farther to the right as we could hear the footsteps fade in the distance. Then, about 5 minutes later, we heard a tree fall to the right of us across the creek where we heard the footsteps and hoot sounds. After all this the frogs started croaking again. We fished a little longer and decided it was time to leave.","Take County Road 100 off old route 40 (lady bend hill), go pass Egypt Valley stone yard, continue approx 2 miles...if you come to a wooden bridge you went too far.

"My buddy and I use to do a lot of cat fishing along the banks of the Ohio river and during the winter we would fish down at the hot water discharge for DP&L since the boilers kept the water in the low to mid 80's. We'd arrive at dusk and fish until around 8-9 am the following morning. Depending on how cold it was we would sometimes build a small fire to keep warm and help us to see our lines. On this particular day it was very cold but relatively clear skies with little to no wind. After walking down the winding trail from the highway to our regular spot we began to setup our poles. I cast my lines out and began to gather kindling and driftwood for a fire. While walking the banks for wood I noticed small barefoot human like footprints in the sand just at the waters edge. They were approximately 5-6 inches in length but abnormally wide and surprisingly deep. I remember thinking that it was awfully odd that someone would allow their child to run around barefoot during the winter, especially in an area that was littered with random fish hooks and broken glass. I pointed it out to my buddy and we joked about it. We brushed it off as a freak occurrence and didn't discuss it any further. Only after our later experiences hearing vocalizations, wood knocks and having rocks thrown at us did I realize that we might have been experiencing Sasquatch activity, and that the tracks we observed that day might have been left by a juvenile.",Hot water discharge for the DP&L power plant.

"Two weekends ago, I was crossbow hunting for deer down the end of Twin Bridges Rd. With it being the last day for gun season, I decided to go much further than I've gone into the woods, mainly to get away from the main parking area. I started down the equine trail towards the south. I walked a good forty five minutes before deciding I was good and far away from the ""Bang bangers"", and not likely to get hit with a deerslug. As usual, I hunted til I could not see twenty yards, and started to get my gear together. I heard a couple loud cool owl hoots by the time I had my gear stowed, when I heard a howl that made me stop and compare to things I've heard in the past. The only description that comes to mind is the howl done by the lady on Bigfoot Hunter, the name escapes me at the moment. Logical thinking told myself it was probably a coyote, but for grins, I picked up a short solid branch and gave the nearest tree a couple good whacks. I listened for a couple minutes, and not hearing anything, I loaded my ghost blind and pack onto my back, picked up my crossbow and started my long walk back to the parking area. I was walking for less than five minutes when from in the distance behind me, came two loud knocks, followed by a long drawn out ""Yip"". Needless to say, I wasted no time getting back to my truck.

"My grandson and I had driven up to East Fork Lake to take pictures of deer. They come out in the evening to graze near the lake. We took a few photos of the deer then decided to leave because it was getting dark. As we were leaving the park (two lane road with heavy woods on both sides of road), I had been talking to him (he was driving and I was in the passenger seat) when I turned my head forward and noticed something a short distance in front of us next to the side of the road. There was something tall and very dark that was hard to make out. As we slowly passed it I could finally see it and realize it was a Sasquatch. It was very large with a chest about 3 feet wide and stood about 7 to 8 feet tall. It was not moving, it was just standing there looking down the road from whence we had just come. I said to my grandson ""what was that” and he could not answer. We kept driving out of the park too afraid to turn around and go back. It had come out of the woods and was probably getting ready to cross into the heavy woods across the road. That animal was huge and looked very powerful. I was shocked because it is a busy park but with a lot of deer and people with picnics. I forgot to mention it was late, somewhere around 8 PM, the sun had already gone down but we were still able to make out object from the twilight.","Take Route 125 east out of Cincinnati, Ohio and go through Amelia for about four or five miles.

"One night this past Spring at about 10:00 PM, when it was warm enough to be outside at night without a coat and with just  shorts and a t-shirt on, and when the leaves on the trees were budding but not fully grown-in, our Border Collie/Australian Shepherd was out near the front of our property which is just across the street from the East Fork State Park woods, barking his head off. Often, even at night, I will just ignore him because he barks at every little thing.  But this bark definitely sounded like he was saying there’s something HERE and I want to let the whole world know.  I was in an outbuilding, went inside, and grabbed my high-powered flashlight.  When I came back out our dog was still barking loudly and remained laser-focused as he stared at something in the woods across the street. I shone my light between some trees, and bam, got some bright eyeshine right back – not the red eyeshine you so often read about, but bluish-white, I think.  Now, at no point did I have my glasses on which I use for driving at night, but, here’s my point – the eyeshine was at a height that I guessed to be about ten to twelve feet up.  The eyes stayed fixed on me at that point, blinking – sometimes both eyes at once, sometimes one eye then quickly the other.  My wife came out and said “Oh, it’s just an owl,” but I wasn’t convinced.  My voice was trembling a bit because I’ve read the other stories on this website about sasquaches living in the area, especially the one pertaining to the bigfoot standing along the entrance road to the park being only about two miles from our little property below the lake. Besides, I thought, “Why would my 11 year old dog be going crazy over an owl perched on a branch fifty feet away from our fence?  How would he even hear an owl gliding so silently onto a branch in the woods at night?”  It’s also hard for me to believe that he would have happened to see an owl gliding onto a branch at night, but . . . maybe.  It just seems far-fetched.   Well, at that point I went inside and grabbed my b.b. gun.  Probably not the best idea, as I do not yet own a handgun or other weapon that could actually provide some protection if things went south. So, I went to our front door, opened it a crack, held the flashlight in my teeth, kept a fire extinguisher next to me just in case it came rushing out of the woods at me – at least I could try to fill its face with something it would definitely not like to be breathing in – and aimed my b.b. rifle at the eyes still shining back at me.  I pulled the trigger and waited.  About 1 to 2 seconds later (I don’t think I hit it), whatever it was clearly reacted to the b.b. which must have passed nearby.  Then, for about 2 and a half seconds I heard it start to crash through the woods from right to left, with left being in the direction of our mailbox,  driveway, and the road we take to access our street  . . . then silence.  However, what interested me was that our dog was still super-focused and barking, no different, but even after the crashing went quiet, he continued to track something to the left, barking as furiously as ever.  So, if my location was the apex of a triangle, and the creature was at the farthest point away, and its movement to the left represents the base of the triangle, my dog had to run full speed to keep up with it even though my dog’s trajectory would have represented a shorter “base” distance of a smaller triangle.  In other words, kind of like when in a marching band the people on the outside fringe of a circular-moving formation have to march at double- or triple-time to keep up with the people who are barely shuffling their feet at the center of the circle, the creature was moving so fast that my dog still had to run full-out to keep up with it.  I’d say my dog ran about thirty or forty feet to my left in about four seconds, which means that the creature ran about 100 to 150 feet in that time . . . through somewhat dense woods (which is where I always harvest kindling for our Buck Stove, and I can tell you, this section of woods are not impassable by any means, but there is still plenty of undergrowth to have to push your way through). My dog’s gaze then remained focused as he continued to bark at a location in the woods across the street about 15 feet to the left of my driveway, so, I presume that that’s where the creature probably took a turn and headed back deeper into the woods. Lastly, I have been doing a lot of projects in my yard out front all Summer long.  I can tell you that whenever my dog would be outside with me, about 85% of the time I observed him to be staring at that location 15 feet to the left of our driveway.  And, even though our neighbors and their dogs and other activity around our property would and still do capture his attention very easily, when the distraction goes away, my dog still very often will return to his spot and continue his vigil.  In the 20 months that we have lived here, I have never seen him keeping such diligent watch on the woods in general and certainly not on one location in particular until after this incident. Since that incident there have been times when I have called him in at night and I’ve found him lying down in an alert position and, in the dark, be staring at that same spot, as if waiting to see the creature reappear.  I just can’t imagine an owl or a coyote or a deer having made that initial crashing noise and then going silent like that.  I also just can’t imagine my dog keeping such diligent watch over the woods for weeks and months afterwards in response to a mere owl, deer, or even a coyote.  Besides, no coyote’s or deer’s eyes are going to shine back at me ten or more feet up in the air. I am about 95% sure that I shone my light into the eyes of a sasquatch that night – and a big one, too.  Though I wish I’d thought to go look for tracks the next day after work, two things got in my way:  busyness, and fear.  I’m sure the creature was long gone 24 hours later, but I couldn’t help but wonder if a sasquatch remembers someone firing a b.b. gun at him or not. _________________________________________________ UPDATE: On the night of 10/1/17, around 9:30 PM, I was in an outbuilding on our property (see BFRO report #60924 for a separate report from our property regarding a Class A sighting from the spring AFTER the event described here) with the windows closed and I suddenly heard this strange, loud vocalization coming from the East Fork State Park woods across the street. I would describe them as ""Aroot"" type howls that would also remind you of a bark rather than a moaning howl, and only lasting a second or two in length. Many were cut short and lasted less than a second, with various lengths of pauses in between. Honestly, I now find them hard to classify - hopefully they're attached to this report and you can listen yourself. I have believed the evidence for Bigfoot to be overwhelming for a long time, so my first thought was, ""Is that a Sasquatch?"" Immediately I felt a small surge of both fear and excitement. I remember it was also a perfectly still night to begin with, perfect for making a recording with no interference from wind blowing across the microphone. I proceeded to go into the house and opened the front door to listen, as the front door is closer to the woods and, I'm guessing, about 250 - 300 feet from where the sound was emanating from just within the treeline, I guessed. My first, front door recording is 2:15 in length. I then moved to my office located on the other end of the house which would have been only a little closer to the sound, opened the window, and took a second recording that is 2:10 in length. From my office window I kept my eyes on a circular patch of light coming from a light perched atop a pole closest to the sound, fully expecting to see a Sasquatch stepping from the woods into the light, but that never happened. These same sounds went on for a full 70-75 minutes, around which time the police came in response to our concern that it might be a rabid dog needing to be put down. If we hadn't called, who knows how long the creature would have continued. When the police came they cruised around, a total of 2 cars, I believe, at which time the sounds stopped. The police never did call me to let me know they'd taken hold of a sick or injured canine. Also, our own dog, whom we'd allow to roam the house at night, seemed oddly quiet, not even growling and not reacting like he normally would when they clearly hear another dog making a commotion nearby. Our dog, after all, was in the habit of growling and barking through the fence at our neighbor's dogs on a regular basis, and also at hikers and horseback riders traveling along the road between our house and the woods. The last thing I thought was odd, in addition to the loudness of the vocalizations at a distance of 250-300 feet, was how - if it was a dog - the dog never, in 75 minutes, came towards a house to seek help from a human. Honestly, when I listened to these again, I thought, ""Dang, that creature sounds like it's on the other side of my open window just 20'-30' away from me!"" By comparison, my (healthy) dog was barking today from a distance of about 75' from me and I felt like his volume at 250'-300' would have been, oh, maybe just 25% of what one hears in these recordings. Though my wife and I chalked these odd sounds up as coming from a sick or lost dog at the time, when I found these recordings again the other day, I now find myself to be thinking, with fresh ears, that these sounds were also (besides the volume issue just discussed) too controlled in cadence and tone to be a dog, especially a sick or injured dog. I now wish I'd looked for tracks the next day despite our sick dog theory, just to verify. Whoever investigates this, please be sure to get a copy of both recordings from me.

"On Saturday, October 9th, 2010, I was finishing up a senior photo shoot at Lake Romona on Clearcreek Rd in Fairfield County, Ohio. Upon arrival at the lake, immediately we observed rocks being thrown into the lake. There were three of us who witnessed it, my wife and young son had gone up another trail however and they were not present. My photo subject and I had gone to the lower area to try and get a few shots, but the rock throwing continued. Also observed was tree knocking and limb breaking by the creature at this time and after we had gone back to where we originally heard it. We were across the lake from it, and at that time I had decided to take a quick succession of pictures to try and find what was throwing the rocks at us. At this point in time, all of us decided to leave the area. Since I had my wife and young son with me, I didn't want to run the risk of them getting hurt. It was when I got home that I realized that I had actually gotten  two images of the creature. I also believe that I have another of it observing me when I was taking the picture of the boy in front of the lake, but it is not as clear as the other two.

"My husband and I were driving home down Winchester Southern Rd toward St Rt 22 around 9:00pm on 12/20/2019. It was completely dark outside by this time. We were going around 60mph. My husband was on high alert for deer. We were just talking to each other when we approached the right hand turn off to Wyandotte Rd. My husband fell silent. He saw a very large, very tall, bipedal creature running toward the road from the left hand side. Within a split second I also saw this creature as it continued approaching the road at a full run. It entered into the peripheral of our headlights and came within 2-3 feet of the driver side window. Comparing the creature to our truck, it had to have been nearly 8 feet tall, as it was slightly slouched while running and was a head taller than our truck. It had blondish red fur and domed shoulder/head area.  Since we were going around 60 mph as all of this happened, it ended up barely missing our truck and crossing the road behind us. We didn’t speak for 15-20 seconds until my husband finally said “What was that?!” We immediately turned around and traveled down Wyandotte Rd, in the direction it went behind us, but did not see or hear anything.

"I was traveling on Little Kyger road toward Ohio state route 7 when I popped over a steep hill located one this stretch of road and as my headlights shown back down on the road as I topped the hill, along side the road there is a tree and a road sign, thats when I noticed this large very dark figure along the road with what appeared to be either very dark brown or black fur/coat?? it was a head taller than the road sign that it was walking in front(6 to 7 foot tall) of, it looked as if it was getting ready to cross the road out of a very wet swampy marsh area over into more wooded hills. As my lights hit it as with out thinking it turned back the way it had come very swiftly, but another interesting thing that i noticed was as it tuned to go back into the swampy area I could plainly see the entire bottom of its foot wich was very  very large and light in contrast to the rest of the creature and void of any fur/coat would very much put you in the mind of a humans foot only much much larger. and within just flash was gone.I did stop the following day to see if I could see any kinda of tracks and saw nothing but the composition of the ground would probably not yeild a good footprint next to the road as for the marshy area I didnt venture in..Very strange indeed.","It is about 2 miles out Little Kyger road off of Ohio state route 7 in the cheshire ohio area, over a dip in the road just past the old high school (River Valley )..",Gallia County,Ohio,Winter,38.9264,-82.14285,2/22/11,28912,Class A,33.59,31.76,29.93,0.66,Foggy until afternoon.

While counting the deer, I saw what looked like a bigfoot near one of the deer. It must have known I saw it because it started running away towards the treeline. It was way taller than the deer and was a light to medium brown. It had a huge upper body. It didn't run with a very smooth gait.","From Columbus, Ohio take US 23 south to Chillicothe to US 35.

It was just on the other side of the road by my truck. I started heading back to my truck and it howled again. I had never heard anything like this before. I yelled back at it, and it responded with a more aggressive howl. Shortly after that a large rock came up through the brush and landed in the road.

"Driving down the road headed towards Honobia, I topped a hill. I was on a long downhill then a long uphill into a left hand turn. As I came over the hill, in the distance at the top of the next hill, something reddish brown crossed the road. It didn’t appear to go straight across, more at a diagonal from right to left with right being the farthest point left being the closest. When I first picked it up in my sight, because of the coloration, my brain said dog. By the time it was out of sight, I realized it was on two feet. It happened in a few seconds. It went across the highway very fast. I was late to my destination so I just slowed down in the area to look. Once I got to where I was going and unloaded my gear I went back and spent about an hour walking up and down both sides of the highway to see if there were any tracks to indicate what I had seen.

I went archery hunting on my 11 acres on 10/16/2020 and as I approached my tree stand around 6:00am I noticed a tree that was by my shooting lane had been pushed over.  The tree was approximately  2 or 3 inches in diameter and absolutely no strong winds to push it over the whole week while I was hunting.  I do know that it was standing and not pushed over the day before. Seemed strange but continued to harness up and climb into my deer stand.  Still being very dark that morning I nocked an arrow and settled in to my stand.  Approximately 15 minutes after I shut my headlamp off,  I heard a distinct knock on a tree about 100 yards or so from my tree stand deep in the woods.  It sounded like someone hitting a large stick or baseball bat against a tree.   It knocked about 4 times then stopped and a few minutes later it knocked two times.  It was the strangest thing I have ever heard and the first time I have ever experienced it.  I know that nothing could have made that sound other than a person.  I’ve been an avid hunter all my life and have been in the woods many times, but never before have I heard anything like it, and hope I never do again.","I wish to not share my exact location.

"Early Fri. morning, Sept. 18,2015, 3:00AM. My wife and I were camping at Mohican State Park in east central Ohio. We were camping in our van. My wife went to bed at about 10:30PM, I turned in about 1:30AM. I had to leave the van to relieve myself. I opened the van's side door. I have the interior lights set not to come on when the doors are opened. I glanced around outside, as I always do, and stepped out of the van. The center of the road, running through the camping area is about 25 to 30 ft. from where I was standing. On my side of the road there are individual campsites bordering the road, on the other side of the road is the Mohican River. My dying campfire cast a faint glow, the slightly overcast sky provided separation from the skyline and the tree line in the immediate area. Out of the corner of my eyes I detected a slight movement on the road but everything was bathed in shadow from the trees. I felt I was seeing a shadow of something. I leaned forward peering into the darkness for a better look. The shadowed form booted toward the entrance of the camp area. All I could see was its silhouette. It was upright and moving on two feet. It stood at least 8ft high. I watched in disbelief as it covered about 50ft distance with what seemed like 5 or 6 strides and disappeared into the darkness. I did notice that it had a slender appearance. I knew at once it was a Bigfoot. I had heard of other sightings in the area. I stood there, still in disbelief, running through my mind what I had just seen. I questioned everything else it could have been. Nothing else fit. My mind finally told me, ""Robert, you know what you saw.

"My 20 year old step daughter had a visual sighting last night in Ashland, Ohio. The date was 4/24/2021.  It was about midnight and she had left a 24 hour gym that has woods behind it. She saw a gray over 7 foot creature after hearing a twig snap.  She stated it was way too large to be human and it moved way too fast to be human. She called us from the local Bob Evans parking lot in tears asking for us to come drive her home because she was so shook up.  It was a terrifying experience for her.  I went and inspected the area briefly the next day.  I found many old deer tracks but no imprints of the creature she saw.  I am not a hunter or a tracker and only spent about 10 minutes in the area. She is one person I would consider an extremely reliable witness.  She is a very responsible college student that is very moral and truthful.  She does not drink or take drugs.","[Investigator notes: The sasquatch was spotted at the edge of the treeline behind the Warehouse 24 Gym on the outskirts of Ashland.

"The incident occurred on June 9, 2021 at approximately 5:15pm. It started raining around 3:30pm and ended around 5pm. I had to get the grass mowed because it was already too long. Usually, when I mow, I have my cellphone in my shirt pocket. But, since it rained, I didn’t want to take the chance of it getting wet. So, I left it in the house. I was mowing in the direction of north to south. There are several large farm fields behind my house. In between these properties are three large depressions in the landscape where a large vehicle could park in there and no one would see it. Through these particular spots are cart paths that run along the bottom (also running from north to south). As I was mowing, a dark figure appeared down by the corner of one of the fields, approximately150-200 yards out. I stopped and looked and was wondering if it was the neighbor checking his trail cam that points to the north. I took my mower over to the wood pile which is approximately 35 yards closer, to get a better view. The field was just planted with soybeans, so I couldn’t go in the field with the mower. At that point, the dark figure was just east of the trail cam and I was hoping it would cross the path of the trail cam, but it seemed to avoid that area. This dark figure was following the deer trail that are 40 yards east of the trail cam. I asked myself, “What am I looking at?” knowing it had just rained. Who would be back there?” I idled the mower down and noticed the toadstools around the wood pile and thought maybe it was a mushroom hunter. But, this “person” was black from head to toe and mushroom season is basically over by now. This large figure started to move across the second field heading northeast along where the deer usually go, down into the large depression in the field. As it was moving across the field, I knew there was no way I would have enough time to get my cell phone or binoculars in time to view it.  I sat there and observed it following the deer trail...knowing it was not a black bear walking on two legs. The whole time I was thinking, “No one is going to believe me”. It seemed to cross the field without any trouble and cleared the field within a matter of a minute and a half. As it disappeared into the chest-high weeds, I sat there for approximately five minutes waiting to see if it would appear on the other side or head toward the large section of woods which have several trail cams along the perimeter of the woods. I also scanned the treeline for any vehicles that might be there from someone out walking, but there weren’t any. I could not figure out what I had just seen. I finished mowing and didn’t even tell my wife about it until a few days later. At my first opportunity, on June 12th we took our golf cart back into the area to see if we could find any prints or tracks. To our disappointment, the field had been no-tilled (Roundup) where the field was filled with weeds, grass, and corn stalks where it made it very hard to find footprints. We also followed the path that it took up to the large part of the depression in the field where you can see game trail going in and out of chest-high weeds. We also took the cart down into the lower part of the depression via the mowed paths that are back there. On June 13th, we conducted a re-enactment with our 15 year-old son. He is about 5’11” and 235 lbs. We had him dress in a black Adidas sweatsuit that had white lettering and stripes on it. My wife took him on the golf cart to the area where I saw the black figure. I sat back at the wood pile on my mower to watch for him. Through cell phone conversations with my son, I had him put up his hood and walk the same path, three quarters of the way through the field, all in black. My first observation was that what I saw on June 9th was much bigger and moved through the field easier than my son did. He was trying not to walk on the newly planted soybeans and trying to miss the old corn stalks in the field. Because of this it took my son longer to cross the field. He was close enough that I could actually see the white parts of my son's sweat suit with no problem. Because of that, I know that what I saw was all black. Note in May, we saw less deer in the area possibly due to the farmer tiling the field. And for the month of June, we have taken cart rides and have seen less deer in the area. I haven’t told too many people for fear of being made fun of. My wife didn’t really believe me until we did the re-enactment. She even says that there is no way you could miss something all black from head to toe back there. I just can’t seem shake it from my mind.","Adjoining roads Township Road 1714, County Road 1754, and Township Road 655 [Investigator Notes: Coordinates: 40.8113889, -82.2680555 Google Maps link:",Ashland County,Ohio,Summer,40.81139,-82.26806,6/9/21,69411,Class B,80,72.325,64.65,0.99,Possible light rain in the afternoon and evening.
"It was June 18th, 2021 about 4:00 pm at Mohican State Park, Loudonville, Ohio in Ashland County. My best friend and Idrove into the picnic area at the Covered Bridge, and there were no campers, hikers, or people fishing, so we drove into Campsite B, its a narrow road that is parallel to the Mohican River. Then we reached the end of this road where there is a turn-around, so we parked the car and shut off the engine. The front of the car was facing towards the Covered Bridge and the Mohican River was on the driverside of the car, and the thick woods were on the passenger's (my side) and to the rear of us. Also, it was an unusually chilly day for the month of June and it was very cloudy, with no sun and a slight drizzle of rain. So, we sat in the car with the windows down, we could hear birds chirping and the soft babbling sounds of the river. We sat there for about 30 minutes, talking away as women do and I mentioned that I watched a Bigfoot show on tv and we should do ""bigfoot calls"". So, jokingly I started doing whoop whoop calls and it echoed in this small area, we laughed for a couple of minutes then took a drink of our pop and we heard two tree knocks, not loud but not soft. Instantly, I was scared because the sound was very close to us, it was about 30 feet up in the thick woods, and it was very steep, almost straight-up. I knew this was not a person because it's too dangerous to climb. This spooked both of us so we started the car and went back to the Covered Bridge picnic area which is more of an open area. Also, there were a few cars so we did not feel alone, and my friend had to use the restroom and I stayed in the car. The woods were still on my right side and I could hear birds chirping loud and fast then all of a sudden they stopped. Then a rock that was about 6 inches wide came tumbling down on the ground of this steep cliff along with dry leaves falling behind it. So I looked up and about 15-20 feet away I saw the left side of a foot, calf, thigh, and hip of an animal. It looked like it was slipping on the leaves and was trying to gain traction and its leg went straight up and behind a tree. This leg looked like a bodybuilder's leg with short black hair and was about 3-4 feet in length. Then my friend got into the driver's side of the car and we left. So, when I got home I looked up videos on youtube of bears. My leg sighting does not match a bear leg because the hind leg of a bear or dog has an odd angle from the pad of the foot to its leg. But what I saw was a human-like foot with hair that connected to a calf, to a knee, to a thigh then to a hip, and it was super muscular.

"I was out in the woods of Ashtabula County, Ohio in the Geneva area. I was picking up wood for a fire we were going to have at the neighbors house. I left my truck at the road, and walked into the woods to find some of the better wood and logs to use. I was coming out of the woods with some wood to put in the back of my truck, when a big hairy upright creature ran across the road and disappeared into the woods in four steps. I got in my truck and drove up there, turned my lights on where it went in to the woods, and I saw two yellow eyes glowing at me, and then they were gone. I'm 5'10 and the creature towered over me, I would say it was easily between 6'10"" and 7'4"". It was by far the scariest experience Ive ever had.

"I was simply driving east on route 90, I had just passed the Lake County/Ashtabula County border and I was looking around as I usually do and I look over at this woodline hoping to see some deer or turkey and to my surprise there was what looked to be a Bigfoot walking through the woods about 100 yards from the roadway. At first I thought I was imagining things but other drivers slowed to look as well. It was about 3:10pm and the weather was partly cloudy, the temp was about 33 degrees and there was a dusting of snow on the ground.

"On February 15th, 2014 at approximately 4 pm my wife, 2 children and I were driving into Geneva State Park. It had been frigid cold and we wanted to see how frozen over the lake and marina were.  At the corner of Padinarum and Lake Road I jokingly asked my daughter if she had “passed gas”…..I was told NO!!  My wife made a comment that the really bad smell was coming from outside.  We often times drive through the State Park watching for wildlife.  We drove slowly through the marina parking lot and stopped for just a few moments.  We noticed there was one truck in the parking lot and two others pulled closer to the lake.  They appeared to all belong to the same snow removal service as they were out of their trucks talking to one another.   As we were pulling out maybe 10 minutes later we were approaching the first curve just outside of the parking lot and I noticed something walking about 50 to 60 yards from the road and it was moving in an easterly direction.  My first thought was it was a person.  I told my wife to stop and she too saw it.  She said it was furry but at the angle I was looking I was unable to make out anything except a very dark figure that “seemed” tall and was definitely walking on two legs.  My wife later told me that she saw arms swaying. In an instant it was GONE!!!  I got out of the vehicle and walked about 40 yards in.  I was unable to spot any sign that would make me think it was anything but a person.  Although, being that the temperature was 15 degrees with a feel like temp in the low single digits I wondered why anyone would be out in this weather. There was also heavy snow on the ground.   I did see some snowmobile tracks but we always drive through the park with the windows down and nobody in the family had heard any engines at all!!  I returned to the vehicle and we drove a short distance to Crabapple Picnic Area parking lot.  We pulled all the way around the large lot and stopped just about 20 yds from the exit and stopped the van.  My wife shut the van off and we told the kids to be quiet.  My wife asked me to whoop or mimic a Bigfoot yell.  I whooped once……nothing.  I waited about a whole minute and let out three large whoops.  Something whooped back!!!!!!!  In a 5 min span of time we heard 2 distinct whoops, 1 scream, and two wood knocks.(We did NOT do any wood knocks at all)   We did NOT see anything else though.  It was difficult to control the excitement in the vehicle.  I am certainly NOT saying that my wife and I had seen a Bigfoot, but we did see a bipedal “something” and heard some very distinct noises, and finally smelled something really nasty.

Rich Mt is the highest point in the Ouachita Mts. I had commented about how squatchy the area looked and my wife replied that we would not see one in the day time. Well, about 45 minutes later she saw one. We were about a mile south of Talimena Scenic By-Way on 259, right on the west end of Rich Mt. She said it was about 35-40 ft off the road walking behind a tree. She described it as being 9-10 ft tall with stringy hair of varying shades of brown. She noticed it was bipedal with long arms swinging in the usual 'squatchy' way. She was very firm when I asked if perhaps it was a bear and said that she knew what she saw. As my luck goes, we were at a point where the road was hairpin curves with no shoulders and no way to turn around. I guess I'll have to wait for my first sighting.

I have hesitated about reporting this encounter because my best friend of 40 years doesn’t believe me.  But I assure you, this really happened.  I am so excited about the encounter that we are returning to the area with our horses in a few weeks to do some investigating of our own and to trail ride some more since it rained on us all weekend this last time. We went to the Cedar Lake, Ouachita National Forest in OK.  The forecast called for rain most of the weekend but we had high hopes of doing a lot of trail riding on our horses.  My parents pulled their RV and we hauled my Dad’s horse along with ours in our stock trailer. And our camp sites were on the edge of the campgrounds, right next to the forest.  Saturday morning we went trail riding, and kept noticing a strange smell. (no one else from the camp was riding at this time, the 3 of us were alone in the woods) Smelled like musky skunk.  And a few times our horses refused to travel up certain trails. After some encouragement they finally went on.  Later that evening about 7:00pm my husband and I went to feed the horses at the camp site where our trailer was parked and saw a herd of deer passing through our camp site.  They stepped just inside the tree line and stopped.  We watched them for about 2-3 minutes then they ran off.  I took some hay down to the woods and put it on the trail hoping they would come back.  That’s when I noticed the skeletal remains of what I thought may have been a deer.  After that, my husband and I went for a walk in the woods to gather firewood before it got too dark. We didn’t get very far when my husband asked me if I had seen that? I said, see what?  He said that he saw something big and black dart across and down a hill. I told him that I didn’t see anything cause I was looking at the ground for firewood.  He was feeling very uneasy and was ready to get out of the woods so we went back to camp with a few sticks of firewood.  When we returned to camp, I was feeling kind of ornery, and decided to play upon my husbands “uneasiness”.  I took a branch and went inside the tree line and made some “wood knocks”.  It was getting dark so we got a small fire going in the fire pit.   And we were all sitting in front of the RV and talking, when we started hearing coon dogs baying as though they treed a coon.  (Could have been coyotes, I have never heard coyotes sound quite like this though.)  So I’m thinking, “Great! We have to listen to the coon hunters all night”.  My momma said that she heard a faint blood curdling scream/moan while those dogs were howling. So we made a few more wood knocks and the dog howling stopped and we never heard it again. Then shortly after that, we heard something walking in the woods, twigs breaking and leaves rustling.  We thought it was deer so we went on about our business telling ghost stories and bigfoot stories when all of a sudden  the trees in front of us started shaking violently! It sounded like something very big was coming thru the forest towards us!  Like a dinosaur movie where you see the forest moving and hear breaking of branches long before the dinosaur jumps out.  It was like that only we were not at the movies!  This was real!  We were all frozen in our lawn chairs! No one could move! We kept waiting for whatever it was to jump out at us! We could hear branches cracking, crunching and rattling and I saw the tops of the trees shaking in a circular motion.  Then it stopped.  And the forest was silent. We had a spot light and we thought about shining it in the trees but we were all to frightened!  My husband doused the fire and we all went inside the RV shortly after that.  The next morning we walked down to the trees that were shaking to look for footprints. (about 20-30’ downhill) We didn’t see anything for all the ground clutter, leaves and pine cones, twigs and pine needles.  I looked at the two trees that were shaking and they were fairly close together, I’d say about 10-12” apart at the base, they were 30’-40’ tall and about 12”-18” diameter.   We also looked for fallen limbs and branches and there was nothing on the ground that wasn’t already there. I’m HOOKED! I want more encounters, I want to see one!",Cedar Lake equestrian park,Le Flore County,Oklahoma,Fall,34.8146,-94.66875,9/15/12,36643,Class B,73.74,68.825,63.91,0.98,Foggy overnight.
"Went camping in the Ouachita mountains near Talemina Scenic Drive.  At 3:39 we all woke up due to the sound of something knocking a tree behind us. Was in the distance but close enough to make you on edge. We thought it was a woodpecker and brushed it aside. 10 minutes later we heard the noise on our right side of the tent. The knocking was in triples such as “ knock, knock, knock” then a pause and the 3 knocks again, but in every direction the knocking had a slight variation. The knocking was coming from all sides of our tent, as if there was something surrounding us communicating. Knocks has slight variations in how quick they were, but all of them had the triple knocking. The closest knock was about 50 yard uphill from us. The close one made everything stop in the woods, it was raining and it stopped along with the wind. This is weird  considering it was super windy up there the whole time we stayed, except that one moment. We all agreed to not camp that spot again.",[camp site near Horsethief Picnic Grounds off Talemina Scenic Drive],Le Flore County,Oklahoma,Spring,34.4415,-94.4325,4/3/20,65284,Class B,63.53,54.69,45.85,0.34,Rain in the morning and afternoon.
"In June 2015, I, my wife, and son, were out at 10:00pm south of Pryor near low water dam on the Neosho river. As we drove the back roads, I stopped my truck and immediately heard a loud ""ape like"" sound coming from the tree line that was appropriately 15 yards to our left. We shone a light in the area for about a minute. I back my truck up 20 feet and stopped and we heard a second louder ""ape like"" sound from a second location in the tree line. The ""ape like"" sound was a short whooping noise. The second noise was loader and more aggressive sounding than the first noise. We stayed in the area for several hours with no other incident.","Near low water dam, Pryor side, by Sportsman and Cherokee Heights.",Mayes County,Oklahoma,Summer,36.22935,-95.2419,6/15/15,50756,Class B,78.97,75.205,71.44,0.97,Light rain until afternoon.
I was with a friend of mine behind his grandmas house. We had seen some dead fish near a pond broke in half so we went back later that day to look to see what might have caused it. We went about 100 yards in the woods when my friend had to go use the bathroom so he walked away from me when I heard a noise off to the right. I looked and see something looking around a tree about 50 to 75 yards away. I could make out fur on the outline of the shape it looked like it was about 8 feet tall. I seen it take a step and then I took off running back to the house.,Was on Craig road in the woods behide a friends house I can not remember the house number,McCurtain County,Oklahoma,Summer,34.021,-94.4435,8/14/10,65296,Class A,99.69,86.585,73.48,0.19,Humid throughout the day.
"My wife and I traveled from our home in the Dallas area for a 5 day trip to Hochatown, OK on Oct 26, 2020. It had rained all day and had gone to drizzle by the time we arrived at our cabin around 4:30 pm. We unlocked the cabin and went inside and looked around and then went out right before 5 to start unloading our SUV. My wife grabbed some items and headed inside. Right as she got inside I heard a siren go off in the area of Beavers Bend State Park to warn about water being released from the dam. Immediately I heard a load deep growl. After a few seconds the growl turned into a deep howl. This went on for about thirty seconds and was immediately followed by a loud high pitched scream. This was followed wooooing sounds that lasted about 2 minutes. My wife came out while this was going on. We didn't discuss it as I didn't want to tell her what all I had heard. We grabbed up some items and went into the cabin. Upon coming back outside the sound was gone. I heard the siren go off many more times while we were there but never heard any other sounds. I am an army veteran and also former scoutmaster and have spent a lot of time in the woods but have never heard a combination of sounds like this. I'm still not certain if this actually was one or a coincidence of several animal calls occurring one after the other. My wife thought the woooing sound was wind blowing in the forest when we discussed this after we got home. But at the time there was little to no wind blowing and we never heard that again although it blew quite a bit as it rained the majority of time we were there. I originally sent this sound combination to Cliff Barackman and mentioned the Ohio howl and after looking it up it did sound similar to that. At the time I hadn't really thought much about Bigfoot since back when I was in junior high in the 1970's but after this have become really interested in it after this.",The cabin was located on Rose Lane at the border with Beavers Bend State Park.

"This evening, I decided to venture pass the communication building as the foliage was still at ease. I continued another ½ mile up the path to where the powerlines cross the river, from here the river bank drops 15ft, giving a nice view of the river below. As I approached this area, my eyes were immediately caught by someone down below at the river edge. What I saw was an all-black figure down at the river edge about 250ft away. I thought it was strange because not many people hike off trail into the preserve during the summers nor late in the evening or even pass the communication building. As I watched this “man” down at the river bank, I started to notice settle detail like golden-red hair in the sunset. I also didn’t notice any distinct clothing but hair alone. At this moment I remember being very confuse to what I was seeing. Whoever was down at the river, began to walk inland using it’s arms to move the reed bushes. That I saw it’s long hair dangling from its arm, shoulder to hand. “Omg, it’s bigfoot” I thought. I immediately began to reach for my phone without taking my eyes off the creature, that is when it noticed me. What terrified me the most was not able to make out any details in the face as we made eye contact. That is when I ran. I continued to ran until I met a couple with their dog back at the communication building. I will never forget the look of confusion on their faces when I came sprinting around the corner. I wanted to tell them about my experience but I continued to run as I thought they would not believe me. The following day I returned to look for footprints but was unable to venture into the overgrown foliage. The experience was not enough to scary me away completely, instead I was more cautious of the time of day and surroundings. I continued to exercise at Stinchcomb until I moved to AZ in July 2019.","When I lived in NW Oklahoma City, I would frequently take evening walks at Stinchcomb Wildlife Refuge.

"We were camping at Lower Twin Lake in the Mt. Hood National Forest, and after dark, we were sitting around the fire when my daughter tried doing a bigfoot howl. About 10 seconds after the howl, we heard a tree knock. There were no other people camping nearby. There were 6 of us around the fire, 3 adults and 3 kids. It was midweek, and there were no other campsites being used around the lake. The knock came from a ridge high above the lake.","The trailhead for Twin Lakes is at the Frog Lake snowpark.

"My wife and son and myself were up archery hunting out of Friend Oregon in the Mt Hood National Forest. they had walked up a road to check it out while I waited in the truck for them to return. They soon returned and asked if I had heard a loud whoop type sound. At that time I had not heard anything. They both seemed kind of shaken a bit. I got out of the truck and no sooner got to the back by the tailgate and whatever this was sounded off with a loud whoop sound. We all started walking to the tree line. My son decided to do a whoop sound just goofing off and we got a louder whoop sound back that's where it all started. The whoop sounds got louder in front of us and started from the left, the middle, farther away in the middle and to the right of us. It lasted for several minutes.

I saw a Big Foot outside of our bathroom window in Anadarko today 4/26/12 around 12pm. It walked along the tree line and then quickly down into the Washita River. I could only see it from the waist up because of the grass being so tall but it was at least 6 feet tall and around 275 pounds if not more. It was covered in long brownish hair. I only saw the back of it but he said it was NOT a human and was surely a Big Foot.,Just behind our home in Prairie Village.

"Hi, I am from Cache, oklahoma my story takes place in the Wichita mountain just a couple of miles away from my home. About five years ago i was at camp Y'Shua for a church outting and there are mountains that surround the land. My grandma ask me if i want to hike this mountain with her and i said yes well we began to walk up this mountain and i take off from her and go ahead and im rushing up the mountain when i hear someone runing a little ways up from me so i go to see what it is and i see these two tall white creatures and they have hair that covers their bodies and i could even see the dirt stains in their fur they were so tall there faces were covered by the trees. so i ask them who they are and they dont answer so i keep asking questions and they dont respond so i yelled for my grandma and then start to run away until i couldnt see them no more. I told everyone what i saw i thought they were joggers but there is only one way up that mountain no other and i remembered the story my grandma told me bout the mountain next to it.

"I was at Lake Elmer Thomas Recreational Area Otherwise known as LETRA, on Fort Sill Oklahoma, I had gone down to lake to show my wife where my friend and I used to go fishing. We parked on an inlet of land leading to a small island that could only be crossed through the water. I pointed to the west to give her a kind of an idea of where it was that my friend Lester and I used to drive down to reach a hidden peninsula where the bass were big. When i looked towards the area which is less than maybe half a mile away you could see the area behind our fishing spot which was just a hill in the wilderness. Thats when i saw a LARGE dark figure walking very fast. My estimations from the size of the creature to from where i was standing, it was probably somewhere around 7-8 feet tall. There is nothing but ranges and wilderness in that area.. there is no reason for anyone to be walking alone that far into wilderness of Fort Sill...my wife and I quickly left after what i witnessed.. to this day i still havent gone back to that fishing location in fear of what could possibly be there.",its on lake elmer thomas recreational area. the lake ON post. not off of it.

"This happened in early to mid October 2011 when my wife and I were driving west towards mile marker 26 on Hwy 66 in southern Oregon to go hunting. To the best of my recollection this is what happened: It was between mile marker 26-27. My wife were cruising along at 45-55 miles an hour. While heading to a hunting location we will still be looking for deer but going at a faster speed till we get to our next dirt road. I call this speed hunting. We were driving a stretch of this highway and it was just before mile marker 26, on the east side. It was kind of straight with a small bump or hill in the road in the near distance. I was driving and on my left was an area next to the road that was slightly treed but easy to see through. We could see about a 100 yards straight back off the road before it became more heavily treed. Coming up fast on our left was where the trees got thick again and this semi clearing was going to end. So I would call this an L shaped tree line. Running to our left, away from the road and us we saw something moving very fast. My observation of what I saw was a 7-8 foot tall, hairy creature running almost full throttle. Since I was the one driving I couldn’t give my 100 % full attention to this thing running. The things that I did notice were it was very hairy, ran on 2 legs and had long arms. To be more specific, the hair was black and flowing from head to waist. Black hair from head to torso then a reddish cinnamon hair color from torso to waist. I can’t remember from the waist down for some reason. I think it happened too fast and I was a little caught off guard. It was sprinting but for some reason I didn’t feel it was full speed. I’m pretty sure it was running because we caught it off guard and spooked it. What I did notice was it looked like a lot of the Bigfoot that I have seen on TV shows. So after we passed it I looked at my wife and I asked her “did you see that?” She said yes. We both agreed we just saw a Bigfoot but yet part of us just wanted to say no we didn’t!  We talked a little about it and kind of dismissed it having second guessing ourselves. So the next year it was hunting time again and we found ourselves going down Hwy 66 again. We started looking for the same spot we had our encounter. Both of us had really never talked about this the past year. So I brought it up again to my wife and I described what I saw the previous year. Strangely enough our remembrance of what we both saw was pretty close. We’ve been hunting for years and have seen a lot of animals out in the wild. We have seen Antelope, Elk, Deer, Bear, Bison, Bobcats, Emu, Turkeys and other creatures. We know for a fact it was not anything we had ever seen before. This thing stayed on 2 legs and never went down on all fours. My wife and I are not attention seekers and have nothing to gain from this. We enjoy just keeping a low profile in life but we felt we should say something about what we saw. I figure no one in there right mind would put on a Sasquatch suit during hunting season to get attention.

"It took us about an hour to cut our way in with chainsaws. The road was blocked by trees from the winter snow storm. We were the first back in there. We were going in to look for remains of an old homestead. We had walked up from the truck about a hundred yards. It's an old logging unit with trees about 10-12 feet tall. Had to pick and cut our way threw the ferms and blackberry's. I walked into a small opening on a rise.

I'm old and the vision is not what it used to be. I wasn't sure I was looking at a shadow. But then it moved about two feet to the left. And just stood there and looked strait at us. We watched it still not believing what we were seeing. It was perfectly still. After a minute or two we turned away for about 10-20 seconds turned back around and it was gone. No doubt one hundred percent gone. We were looking at the head shoulders down to mid abdomen. I have worked in the woods from 14 years old.

Woke to hear foot steps outside tent heading to truck, something rustled around in the truck, thought it was my son. I rolled over to see my son shaking inside his sleeping bag. Before I awoke to the footsteps, he heard at least two different vocalizing/mumbling sounds with walking around our tent. They stopped on my side and he heard a loud vocalization type talking and saw a large hand push in the side of the tent using three fingers, about 4-5 inches.

"My adult daughters where out camping the weekend of 10AUG2012  in a slightly remote camp in the Tillamook  forest. For 2 nights in a row they heard possible big foot calls that went on for 20min the first night and about 3 min the next night. I can assure you it was not any Elk, Deer, any of the owl species, That calls where  whoop call, and im told  extremely loud, This group totaled 6 that weekend that heard this series of calls. The following weekend this weekend friday 18AUG I myself and a friend from work and his daughter went to the very same camp to hear for ourselves and attempt to get recordings of the calls, long story short, I’m an experienced out doors man as an avid Bow hunter and fisherman I’ve spent countless hrs in the woods and have heard most of all the local animal calls. From all the known owl calls, to every possible combination of elk and deer calls to the death moan of a bear. I’ve been known to follow elk heads at night and just be in a good place to hunt them in the Am. Be that as it may On Friday the 18th I set out to this camp and waited for the arrival of my work friend and his daughter. After dinner we relaxed at the camp fire till about 9:00 p.m. and set out for a short hike to the power line rd and did some Knocking, with  no responses’ we returned to camp and was doing a little star gazing around the camp fire.  At 10:15 p.m. to our astonishment we heard in rapid succession a series of Knocks 1,2,3,4,5 pause then 1,2,3,4,5, coming from the SE 2 sets of about 5 of 6 knocks with a delay between sets of about  no more than 5 seconds. Within 10 seconds of the second set of knocks we had our recorder going hoping to capture more  knocks on tape when from the NE we heard a classic call back Howl in response 2  Howl calls in fact, We have captured those calls on tape. Being that our camp was in-between the calls my best estimate of distance or camp was from the calls where no more than a ¼ to a ½ of a mile as the crow fly’s with us between them, our camp that night was the only camp site taken in the whole camp ground. With the closest set of camp grounds approximately 6 miles away. In conclusion with my current back ground in Metrology and reporting my findings with an unbiased opinion using the return calls taped on your show that I’ve heard over time and applying them as a reference standard I must therefore conclude this as the genuine article and report this as very plausible given my own personal experience. All I need now is to personally see one and it push it over the top for me. As it stands right now I feel 85% certain that this phenomenon is real. I am no expert with regards to Bigfoot and would love to hear your thoughts on this matter and would very much enjoy putting you in contact with all involved and giving you the audio we recorded. I look forward to hearing back from you as I would very much like your thoughts on the recordings we have.",Oregon Hwy 6 West.,Tillamook County,Oregon,Summer,45.61308,-123.3973,8/18/12,36280,Class B,71.1,62.425,53.75,0.04,Mostly cloudy until afternoon.
"I was camping at Jones Creek at exactly the 4 mile marker on July 7, 2014. The woods were very quiet and only one guy on a 4 wheeler came past me and then again leaving much earlier that day. Just at dusk I heard a yell like no other animal I have ever heard about a quarter mile south. It lasted about 10 seconds. A minute or two later it happened again only louder. The hair stood up on the back of my neck. About 5 minutes later another yell comes about a quarter mile north of me only this time its 3 times louder. It yelled 5 separate times with about 10 seconds between each 10 second long yell. These yells were much stronger of a voice than the first two yells. About 2 minutes later the first yeller did it again only it sounded like it was further south. I don't believe a human could be as loud as this was at a distance and the voice was far too big. I was scared to death and spent the night with my gun in my hand laying frozen in my completely dark tent trailer. I was afraid to turn any lights on just pretended to be asleep.

"November 2013 We live near the Umatilla River just 2-3 miles outside of Pendleton, OR on the Umatilla Indian Reservation.  It is not a remote area.  We are surrounded by farm ground and a couple neighbors within a couple thousand yards or so on a dirt road. We sleep with our bedroom window cracked about 2 inches open so the bedroom stays very cool. I awakened around 12:30AM and sat straight up in bed because I had heard something.  It was very quiet in the house and no unusual noise outside but I had heard ""something"" that woke me up wide awake. Listening intently for several minutes, I heard this weird and very loud wailing, screaming, laughing noise that sounded like a cross between a woman hysterically screaming and then quickly changing to hyena-like laughing and almost a ""wooping"" yell. I jumped out of bed and ran to the front door that opens to farmland and low rolling hills.  It sounded like several hundred yards out.  It repeated 3-4 times, each getting quickly farther away like it was running. I did not awaken my spouse. A couple weeks later, the same thing occurred late at night.  Then, a few days later around Christmas/New Years the local newspaper ran a story about ""Bigfoot"" scaring tribal members and people at night.  There was also a large number of phone recordings of the same crazy maniacal laughter I had heard.

On the morning of the 12th just after 6am I was making coffee when I heard a guttural growling that rose to a higher pitch scream and then became a whooping sound, after which it dropped back down to a growl.  This sequence repeated three times.  My dog freaked out barking, but would not go past the saplings on the east edge of the camp, which is strange because he usually pursues deer, elk, and bears several hundred yards into the woods. I grabbed my bow and walked past the line of saplings, into an open forest that sloped down to a ravine with areas of dense vegetation.  I called my dog to follow, but he would not come.  The forest in this area is full of downed trees, where my sons and I had gathered firewood the previous afternoon.  I believe the sound came from the vegetation / trees at the bottom of the ravine, which we had been within 30 feet of when gathering downed wood. I only walked about 20 feet past the saplings, and stood on a log for a better view, but did not see anything moving.  I then decided to go back to camp, being a bit worried because my dog wouldn’t leave the area of our tent.  For the next hour and a half I sat with my bow next to me, the dog sitting between my legs, and listened to many instances of downed branches cracking beyond the saplings.  When the cracks stopped, it was abruptly, not fading as if the cause were moving away.  These were large branches being broken, similar to the sound of a bear breaking wood.  My dog is not afraid of bears and has chased away several, including one the previous week in eastern Idaho. About half an hour after the cracking sounds stopped the dog went out in the forest to investigate, and everything seemed to return to normal.  It was then that I again heard the squirrels angrily chirping and chittering at the dog, and realized that I had not heard it at all during the noises or cracking. I have never heard anything in the Blue Mountains, Rockies, or Cascades like this sound.  It sounded nothing like deer, elk, moose, bear, mountain lion, or bobcat.  The only thing I could possibly think is maybe a mountain lion was killing an elk, but it repeated three times with just about the same length and cadence.  And the whooping part of it reminded me of those plastic bellows hoses that you swing in the air to make a whistling / whooping sound. While in Pendleton a couple days later I was describing the sounds to a local hunter when an older native woman overheard and said she thinks it was a Bigfoot, and that she’s heard them on the Umatilla Reservation.","Near NF-3102, before Red Saddle (45.4502371, -118.3243227)",Umatilla County,Oregon,Summer,45.45024,-118.3243,8/12/20,65970,Class B,64,55.64,47.28,0.79,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.
"On Sunday night, January 19th 2014, last night approximately 9 p.m. I was returning home from the school house restaurant on route 670 north of Dyberry Pennsylvania, I was heading south coming down a hill and an oncoming car had his high beams on. I glanced away from the beams and when I looked back at the road I was coming to the bottom of a dip in the road and as I looked back at the road I saw TWO VERY LARGE LEGS WITH EXTREMELY LARGE FEET ATTACHED ! I saw three strides and it was across the road and the fourth step took it up a 7 foot bank. The fur appeared to be long and very dark, almost black but with a bit of a sheen to it. The fur appeared to go all the way to the ground around the feet. Because I was approaching the bottom of the dip, my headlights were only catching the very bottom of where the road came back up and he was at the very top of my headlight beams. I backed up and pulled out a light, looked for tracks through my car window. even though I am an experienced hunter and tracker, I felt goose bumps and the hair on the back of my neck was standing up and I left after I locked the doors.

"I wasn't going to report this incident, but I believe it is of major importance to the Bigfoot research community. I will try to keep it simple. I had recently purchased a used vehicle and we decided to take it for a test drive to Laverne Park, which is just a short drive into the mountains from where we live. I was with my girlfriend, her 14 year old daughter, and my dog. After passing the park, we drove on further to see the country. We found a right turn and followed the rural road up into the forest. I later found out that we were traveling up Moon Creek. Not long after heading up the road, my car started overheating. I didn't have water on me so I decided to stop at the first water source, which was a bridge of the creek. I pulled over and we got out. While stepping out of the truck by girlfriend said, "" hey, there is something walking on the hill above us"". We stopped and listened for a moment but it was quiet. I then looked for a place to collect some water from the creek but it turned out that the edge of the water was too steep to step down and get water from. So, I had come up with a quick plan to connect some string to a cup and ""fish"" the water from the bridge. While we were trying to get the cup to fill, a small stone was thrown at us and bounced on the concrete of the bridge we were on. I looked up and noticed a steep hillside above us wondering what the hell could throw a rock at us. I noticed my dog was sitting in my truck, which she never does while I'm out of it in the wilderness. I was getting a little spooked so I tried to speed up the process of getting the water in the cup. Then, another stone bounced on the bridge next to us. I literally watched it skip along the cement. I mentioned that we better hurry, and then, from somewhere up the hill, came a very large rock, about the size of a softball of larger. It smashed against a huge rock in the creek and busted into pieces. I stood up on the bridge, looked at my girlfriends daughter and said, ""let's go now!"" My girlfriend and dog were already in the truck when I slammed the hood down and dove inside. We drove down the mountain and pulled over. I had left so fast that I didn't put the radiator cap back on. I considered returning after getting water to try to get pictures, but my girlfriend wouldn't let us go back. Now, either somebody was on that steep hill in the middle of the forest screwing with us and throwing rocks, or something else was. If it was a person, they are mighty brave in a forest full of hunters and guns. I don't know, seems awful strange.","Drive past the Lavern Park, take first right over bridge up Moon Creek.

"On the morning noted a neighborhood man was driving down Pilottown Road around 4-5 in the morning when he came across large human-like footprints crossing the road and heading into a field/wooded area. I was almost 17 and when I woke up later that morning several neighbors were inspecting the tracks which came from a field behind my house, through my yard, across Cookslanding Road, into my neighbors yard, over a fence into a wooded area, across Pilottown Road and into the field/wooded area. The direction of travel appeared to be south east toward the Susquehanna River hills. Whatever made the tracks did take the time to inspect my rabbit hutch and my neighbors as well, though leaving them undisturbed. it also seemed to have walked around my neighbor's house, leaving 1 very good print protected by the overhang of the roof. The rest were partially filled with snow, but still unsettling due to their size and shape. The tracks were about 16"" long, 8.5"" wide, and 2"" deep in the snow, and had a stride of about 4 feet. I am including a tracing I took of the well preserved track I found. It may seem a very incredible way of preserving the footprint, but it was the only thing I could think to do to preserve it. I traced over it EXACTLY as it appeared in the snow. To this day nobody knows what made the tracks. My neighbor and several other people of the neighborhood are avid hunters and outdoorsman.

"One night me and my friends went catfishing in a local spot near my town. We had set up at about 8:30 p.m. and we're having a good time.

"I have debated whether or not to report my encounter to the BFRO or any organization. I don't know why, but I guess I wanted to keep this experience to myself for a few years and then it just didn't seem to matter as far as reporting it. But now, I realize that all encounters need to be in a data base somewhere. These DO exist and when that day of discovery happens, this database will house many of the answers.  My encounter happened in early June of 2010. I took a friend to the Marienville/Timberline ATV trails northeast of Marienville, Pennsylvania in the Allegheny National Forest, to ride ATV’s for the day. Allegheny National Forest covers approximately 515,000 acres or 800 square miles of protected wilderness in North West Pa. The forest is pretty dense in most spots and has many types of terrain. From my understanding the Allegheny National Forest is one of the least densely populated areas east of the Mississippi River. Surrounding the Forest are more woodlands and farm country. The 2 trail systems we were riding that weekend join together and make an approximate 60-80 mile loop from the northern end down to the bottom, and then back up the other side of the loop. My encounter happened on our return back up, heading North. I remember it rained very hard the night before and through the early morning because my friend, who was new to ATV'ing, didn't bring rain gear. We had to go into town to buy him some cheap rain gear and then headed up to the trail. It rained the first half hour or so of our ride and I remember the sun coming out and it was turning into a really nice day for a ride. For those that ride ATV’s, they know that the rain makes mud, which is much more fun to ride in than dust. A few hours into the ride, having stopped and observed some beaver dams, some very old oil wells, a couple logged out areas where you could see for what seemed like miles and other cool sites that the forest has to offer, I was getting in more of a hurry to get back - it was approaching the end of the day. My buddy was way behind me so I decided to stop on the trail and wait for him. I usually don't separate from atv buddies when riding, but this part of the trail was an abandoned logging trail and pretty easy so I rode ahead awhile and then decided to stop and wait for him. He didn’t ride fast or dangerous; he ""putted"" so I knew he was safe, just slow. If he didn't shown up I would turn around and meet up with him. I wasn’t sitting long. I just took my helmet off. That’s when I noticed rocks kept hitting the front right side of my ATV. They weren’t large rocks, maybe about or just smaller than hand sized. It took a minute or so before it occurred to me that I was stopped and that rocks should not be flying through the air and hitting my atv. I was turning my head towards the right to follow the path of these ""air rocks"" as I called them, when my turn stopped. I noticed this “Stump” which turned out to be a dark figure, approximately 70-90 feet away, that appeared to be in a sitting or crouching, or just a low position, then stand up into an upright position. I’ll never forget how it seemed to pop right up like it was on a spring, with very little effort. Initially I looked at its hands because I was interested to see what was in its hand, if anything. It was much taller than a normal human – best guess at this point would be 7.5 feet or so, and absolutely NOT a bear. It was VERY broad at the shoulders. Almost freakishly broad – I remember that very well. It was on 2 legs and I could see its right arm hanging down, which was on the left side because it was facing me. I remember wanting to watch its right hand to see if “it” was armed or what it might be doing. That is funny to me now, because for some reason I assumed it was right handed. It moved its right arm to a slightly bent position, stopping with its hand in front of it, at about its waist. Its left arm stayed hanging to its side – very long arms.  It was all very dark black – a shiny black – from head to toe, or as far as I could see to its feet as it was standing in 1-2 foot tall grass or taller. As my eyes made their way up on the creature I could see its head was all black as well. There was no white or lighter color that stood out, like most animals would have on their face. I could not see clear details of the face as it was all black as well but it did not appear to have hair on all of its face. It appeared to be black skin - the same color black as its hair but I could tell it wasn't hair in some spots. I noticed that the eyes were black, or very dark and deep, with a pronounced brow ridge. I could obviously tell it had a face. I just couldn’t see defined detail of the lips or anything as it was all the same color. The lips were closed though and in a straight line across its face, not open mouthed or smile or frown – just straight lips. The hair was short to medium length and not shaggy. I’d say the hair was an average of 3 to 5 inches long, shorter at the head.  It was almost groomed in appearance but I think it’s from the hair being short and thick. At least that was my impression. Oddly, I did not notice any mud or dirt all over it, which seemed odd because it had rained hard the night before and didn't stop until several hours before this. The trails were muddy. Almost as soon as my eyes were at its head and face and I was trying to “zoom in” and get a better look at the face, it began to leave. It didn’t turn and walk away, but rather it stepped straight backwards into the brush and the trees and not take its eyes away from me. It stayed square to me as it was moving backwards. This all happened in the span of no more than 30 seconds, from the time I noticed the rocks hitting my ATV, up until it moved backwards. When I play it over and over in my mind, it seems more like 30 minutes. At this point an overwhelming fear just filled my mind, and I remember feeling like I shouldn’t be in this spot right now. I don’t remember shaking in fear or anything like that, but I felt warm and almost like I was going to puke. So I hit the gas and took off.  I wish now that I wouldn’t have just fled, but the feeling that came over me was not like I’d experienced before. I had my smart phone/camera in my fender bag and it NEVER occurred to me to get it out and start video. I honestly couldn’t move for a short period of time.  I have been surprised by people walking up on me in the woods and have hunted all my life, so animal encounters, even bear from a distance - do not scare or alarm me. I was in the military for 6 years, and actually had the honor to serve as SEAL TEAM 4 and SDV TEAM 2 (the old UDT TEAM 2) support, as part of a special warfare boat crew. During that time, I had many highly anxious experiences as one could imagine. To summarize, I am pretty observant, I don’t have a tendency to over-react and I don’t scare easy. I am very level headed and definitely not crazy. I didn't instantly think ""Bigfoot"" as I wasn’t a REAL believer then. At least I doubted their existence in the Eastern US and if they existed it was only in the Northwest US, Canada or Alaska.  This encounter took my emotions to places they had not been or at least had not been for a long time. It has been going through my head for over 4 years. I didn't tell anybody except my fiancée within the first year after the encounter. Now - quite a few people know. The person I was riding with that day just found out in 2014. I never told him about the story before, but because I couldn’t remember if it was springtime/early summer or late summer/Fall when this happened. I asked him what week if he remembered. When he told me it was springtime / early summer, he naturally asked why – what’s up? I told him what happened. It turns out that he believes in these creatures too. He then realized why I was acting so weird when we finally caught back up with each other, and then on the 2 and a half hour truck ride home. Now I wish I would have told him then. Maybe we could have joined together and gone back to look for signs or whatever we could find. Instead, the overwhelming feeling of “What the heck was that”, and “I can’t tell anybody-they won’t believe me anyways” took over, and I kept it to myself.  Nobody has to tell me what I saw or didn't see. I knew what I saw. I saw a large dark figure with hair that could throw rocks (and very accurately), stand up within 100 feet from me, in a large dense forest where there aren't any cabins or people just hanging out.  I still do leave the option open for an extremely large man (larger than anyone I have ever met) in a heavily padded Gillie suit with hair on it standing about 100 foot from the trail just waiting for someone to stop in that exact spot so he could throw rocks at him and take a chance of getting shot (most folks on ATVs will pack a handgun when riding in deep woods. At least that's my experience). Now that’s being sarcastic, but trying to make a truth out of what happened. Of course that option is slim, but it will always be there as I didn't walk up to this thing and shake its hand or hug it, so being 100% sure it was a Sasquatch just isn't possible. I am at 99.999% sure though. I do know that a fear like I’ve not felt in a long time, if ever, took over me for awhile. Something told me to go, to move on, that I shouldn't be here right now. Again - I am a very rational person and this just didn't make sense to me at all. I eventually plan on returning to that general area, on ATV and parking the bike and doing some walking. I just need to look around and feel comfortable with that. Ever since my encounter, I cannot put this down. I’ve been researching since and came across various online groups that discuss encounters. I want to learn as much as I can before returning and looking around and I want to go armed with more knowledge than I have now. UPDATE: I have returned to this trail (5 1/2 years later) and found the area this happened. It was strange being there.  Some of my biggest questions since learning more about these creatures are “What was it doing there, close to used ATV trails” and “Why did it draw my attention to itself?” If it hadn’t thrown rocks I would not have looked and if it hadn’t stood up, I probably wouldn’t have even noticed it. Someone told me that maybe it was travelling and recently crossed that trail. The reason for rock throwing and drawing attention to IT was possibly to draw attention to it on purpose so my attention wouldn’t go to something else nearby less able to protect itself. I interpret that as young ones. That NEVER crossed my mind. Just to realize that one was in the area blew my mind away and made me start thinking differently about what could be out there. Now, there may have been more? I’ll never know that for sure, but it does make sense to that question that’s been bugging me. I now wonder if there were young close to me, maybe they were throwing the rocks being mischievous. It is still hard for me to grasp that anything could throw rocks from approximately 90 feet away and hit the same general area – very, very accurate. If it wanted to harm me, it would have beaned me in the head and I wouldn’t be writing this encounter.  I've since been researching an area about 25 miles west of this location. I went from not caring or thinking about Sasquatch to a full blown enthusiast. I attend conferences and have actually received an invitation to Beachfoot in Oregon in 2016.  For this years Ohio Bigfoot conference, Sybilla Irwin (a BFRO member and artist) is doing a drawing of what I've described to her, and will be unveiling it at the conference. All of this is exciting, and I cannot wait to see her bring this back to life, and return my emotions back to that 1 minute of my life that changed how I think now. I cannot attach that picture yet as the Ohio Bigfoot conference director has asked not to put it out there until after the conference. But if you would like, I could come back to this and attach the drawing, which will be as close to what I saw as possible. also - for more info on this, The guys from Monster X internet radio contacted me and asked if I would come on their show. They saw my encounter on a group. I agreed and did a 2 hour show with them, discussing this event. Google MONSTER X Dave Groves. I am not looking for any type of notoriety out of this. It's why I haven't put up a report. But they found me and asked, so I agreed. I feel that folks need to know about this and that these creatures DO exist Anybody who knows me will tell you I am a very honest person. It is one of my strong qualities.  I know there are many made up hoax bigfoot stories out there, but I can assure you that this is NOT one of them. I wasn't out looking for a bigfoot that day. I did not ask for this encounter to happen. But it did, and it changed many things about me. I stopped hunting deer and have not hunted since that day. I now cannot put Bigfoot stuff down and even started a bigfoot book collection with some very old and hard to find, autographed bigfoot books.

""WHOOOOWHOOP"" A lower tone followed by a higher one. VERY SIMILAR to your recordings.... almost spot on. This continued for about a minute or two. Not the first time I've heard it either.

"The Saturday night before Easter 2020, I was sitting outside by a crackling fire, all alone. Was about 11:30 at night, and I had some music playing low on a small Bluetooth speaker. From way deep in the valley below me, and I mean it’s a huge expanse of woods back there, a couple miles to the next road, I heard a bone chilling ethereal howl.  Then I heard it again. Turned my music off, and listened intently.  I heard it three more times over the next minute or so. Too faint to record but loud enough to hear beside a crackling pine fire.  Each instance was three or five seconds long, sounded “WHOOOOHRRRLL”.  Started soft, picked up in intensity, then tailed off.  Whatever it was it was very loud, very powerful, almost resonated like a train whistle does from a distance.  I could also tell the sound was projected in different directions on a couple of the howls. I have spent a lot of time in the woods in my life. I'm an avid hunter, and an all around outdoorsman.  I'm familiar with the animals that live here in PA and I know I didn't hear one of them.  I know what barred owls sound like, coyotes, dogs, people... Pretty sure this was none of those. Whatever made that sound was large and powerful.  It stood the hairs on my neck. I sat listening for another half hour or so and didn't hear it again.  That's when my mind got to wandering.  I spent pretty much the entire next day (Easter Sunday) listening to recordings on YouTube and the like and a few sounded a lot like what I heard.  A supposed bigfoot recording from Westmoreland County PA and the 1994 Ohio Howl in particular were eerily similar.  What I heard was slightly higher in pitch than the Ohio sounds, but almost identical in tone change, cadence and duration.  It's worth noting that I actually I live about 15 miles east of the area where that was recorded.","DO NOT POST LOCATION PLEASE. I do not want the landowners bothered.

"I was driving back from work late on Tuesday the 25th of February and I'll never forget what I saw. As I was driving down Green Lane towards Levitown a giant creature that I can only describe as a Sasquatch. The creature was standing on two feet and had almost a human like form except for its nearly 9 foot stature. As it crossed in front of my car I could see it more clearly in my headlights, it was a very dark brown, but it was more like hair than fur which I found to be even stranger. It couldn't have taken more than three steps to completely cross the road. As I swerved it was already nearly off the road all I could see though my drivers window were what seemed to be piercing blue eyes that seemed to glow. Though I could not differentiate if they were glowing or if it was a reflection of the moon. I haven't been able to sleep much since, all I can think about is those piercing eyes. Once I found this website and read of the sightings, I knew I had to share what I saw.

"While fishing on Lake Arthur at Moraine State Park I heard wood knocks and rock clacks. It seemed that they were answering each other. I would hear 2 wood knocks then maybe 10 seconds later, to the west about 200-300 yards I would hear 3 rock clacks. This sequence continued for about 8-10 minutes. The sounds stopped when a boat went past mine. I do believe in Bigfoot, I always have. However this is the first time that anything like this has happened to me.

" It had to be the summer of 2015, 16 or 17.  I was camping with my sons’ troop in Moraine State Park in Butler County, PA.  I woke up in the middle of the night.  I want to say it was around midnight, but cannot be sure.  This would have been a Friday night into Saturday morning. I was taken back by how quiet the woods were.  Being a seasoned tent camper, this struck me as odd.  Our tent was the closest to the shore line, maybe 30 or 40 yards of woods in between us and the shore.  The deep woods were on the other side of a trail road from our tent site. Up the shore line I heard what sounded like a tree or rock knock.  The knock continued for a little bit and was eventually answered by other tree knocks coming from two distinct locations in the deep woods.  The answered calls seemed pretty far in the distance but still auditable.  The original knock came from our side of the shore and was closer than the other two.  This happened for a little while, the answering calls never changed, but the knock on our side kept getting closer to our tent site. I was actually astonished at how fast the knocks where moving down the shore line.  By that I mean, the knock source closest to us was coming toward our camp site, working its way down the shore line.  Whatever was making the knocks was moving at a good speed for being in the woods at night. Then the knocks stopped right when it felt like the source was directly behind us. The following night was Saturday. I woke up again, but this time the woods were their normal sounding self and there was boat life on the lake.  I did hear another knock, fairly distance in the woods, but that was the only one.",Muskrat Cove grouping tenting site at Moraine State Park,Butler County,Pennsylvania,Summer,40.92895,-80.07216,8/15/16,70716,Class B,80.08,74.11,68.14,0.42,Rain in the afternoon.
"Not a good writer, but what happened to me and a friend  - we were walking down an old pulpwood road with his german shepherd  and got a strong smell like a goat and stopped my friend. I walked ahead about 20 ft and said it might be a big rattle snake, about that time I heard leaves rustling and it got louder and a tree about 6 inches around shook back and forth about 2 feet each way and I heard the leaves moving like something was running away. I pulled some branches back and there it was, about 20 feet running away on 2 legs at a very fast pace. It was about 8 feet tall and I could see its muscles in its legs moving and the whitish skin under the 3 inch black hair. Long arms no neck as plain as day.

They were around 15 to 20 feet inside the wood line. It scared the crap out of me, every hair on my body stood on end. This sorta stuff has been going on for the past three years.

"I live in Tuscaloosa Alabama in the Yellow Creek Community  ... My husband and I have heard screams in the woods from some kind of animal that is so loud and it has a long guttural yell that sounds like a man... We have never heard anything like this. This has been going on now for three weeks in March 2012, almost every night just about 8:30, or right before it getting dark. Then it stops for about a month, and now it has started back up again. I have lived in the country all my life and I am 52 and my husband is 66 years old. We are not a bunch of kids making these things up. I know what cougars, coyotes, bears and wolves all sound like. We have never heard anything like this in the woods before... Other then fourteen years ago, my son who is in the Army and still is to this day. He and I were sitting outside one night at 11:00 talking... We heard the same thing yell out then... It came from behind my house and it yells out in that long guttural yell three times and after the third time it sounded like there was 50 or more coyotes were surrounding us and they stated yapping like crazy. ... The recent sounds are coming between my Grandfather's old house place and my home... It is about a 1/2 mile away. We have a huge lake behind us and nothing but woods... My grandfather has some old abandoned gravel pits and lakes close by too.. There is a swamp in front of our home about 1/4 mile away. I was also told when I was a child that back in the 1930’s my grandfather went through the gravel pit one night ... He saw something setting on a hill that looked like a huge hairy thing that had a face like a man.... This was before all the media hype from the Patterson films.. I need help because this thing is getting closer to our home. My husband doesn't have good hearing and he said he could hear it upstairs one night and it sounded like it was in the yard. We have animals, Cattle and Donkeys here we don't know whether to shoot at the sounds from where it is coming from or what... On March 31, 2012, it sounded like it was right down at the bottom of the holler right past our fence ... It sounded like TWO of whatever this thing is, was mad and was yelling at us. I got so scared I took off running into the house.... I have never been so frightened in my life, and believe me when I say I go outside a lot at night by myself I really do, we have a huge wraparound porch   I love to listen to the owls and whippoorwill at night but nothing like this has ever happen to me before.... Last week I went to put my puppy up for the night in our garage then I heard whatever this thing is, let out a scream, I called for my husband to come home it was back. When he got here we heard it growl. It came from the same area as before. Like I said before we heard it just about every night for 3 ½ weeks and then nothing… That night I told my husband HE BACK! Then the next night we heard it again but this time down in front our house down at the swamp. For the past 2 years people have stripped cut thousands of acreage of land all around here and a lot of animals have migrated around here.

I was driving home from work in the afternoon and completely preoccupied with thoughts of my struggles. When my eyes caught something. However my mind was still not focused other than I was waiting for movement of sorts. It’s second nature to keep a eye out for deer in this area. When I finally noticed that I was looking at  something unusual.  I saw a tall hairy animal walking off into the woods (on two feet) from the road. It had long blonde to light brown hair all over. I never saw the face. I kept my eyes focused on the woods where it walked into. When I reached that spot I was completely shocked at the size that creature was. It had to be at least 9 - 10 feet tall. The only thing I could think of was Bigfoot.

My sighting happened last summer. I was kayaking down a creek. It was about the middle of the day. I was comin down the creek. The creek I was coming down is deep in some parts and shallow in some. There are always deer and turkey moving through. When I came around the curve in the creek a splash happened right in front of me. I thought it may have been a fish. So I kept paddling. Then three more splashes hit by me. The last splash I saw it was a rock. So I slowed down in the creek to look. I started looking in the direction the rocks came from. It was sitting on its knees like a person would. Then it stood up. When it stood up. The hair on back of my neck did. Me and it made eye contact for around 30 seconds. It turned and started running through the woods. I've seen and heard people run through the woods. Its stride was wider than any humans. When it ran it didn't bother dogging sticks and stuff. It just ran through the brush. After that I turned around and started paddling back to my truck. I went back down there that night to see if I could spot light it. I done a howl and waited to see if it would respond. But than I heard two knocks back to back. I knocked on a tree. It knocked back at me. But it was off in the distance.

"It was April of 2011. My son, daughter-in-law, wife and I had been over at my in-laws having dinner. My son and his wife and their infant son had recently moved in with us. We were in the process of adding a new laundry room and garage on the back side of our house. When we came in from next door my son and his family were ahead of my wife and me by a minute or two. I noticed the lights to the new addition were on and figured that one of them had gone out to retrieve their laundry. I opened the back door and said is anyone out there. I didn’t yell so I thought they might not have heard me. I stepped out on the patio and started walking toward the garage that didn’t have a door hung yet. As I did I saw a dark figure at the back of our SUV. It scared me that there was “someone” in, or had just passed through our garage. Without saying another word I ran back into the house to get my 410 shotgun and let me son know to join me outside. This only took 30 seconds or less. I went back out but this time I was yelling “if there is someone out there you better speak up or I am going to shoot you.” My son joined me and we ran out into the yard both yelling for the person to identify themselves. We circled our house and saw nothing. It had rained earlier in the afternoon and evening and as we came back to re-enter our house confident that what I had seen ran away we noticed footprints on the concrete patio deck. These footprints at first looked like that of foot gloves people that fit each toe like a glove does the hand. But the thing that was conspicuous was the size. They were enormous. Not only long but wide, huge like that of what an NBA star might leave. (I say that because I have a pair of shoes owned by an NBA star that my nephew gave me who is on an NBA coaching staff.) My point, these were very large feet and very wide strides. It then dawned on me how large the figure I saw in the garage had to be. As stated I own an SUV and at the back part of the garage where I saw the figure the concrete starts to slope down from the garage. This figure I saw was head and shoulders over the top of the SUV and he (it) was already on the slope because he was not inside the garage when I saw him. I joked to my son and later to my family; you know that thing I saw that night was big enough to be a Sasquatch. We all laughed because we had not heard of any other Bigfoot sightings in lower Alabama. Then your show comes to television and I go on your site today and learn that there was indeed a Bigfoot sighting on Ft. Rucker back in the 90’s by a solder. I live just five to six miles from the post. I’m not convinced that what I saw should be reported to you but I do know that if it was a person I never want to see them again on a dark night in my yard because they are a very big person.

"My first sighting was in December 2012. It was about 12 midnight and I was on my way home. It was raining, not to hard but steady. I was going down the highway through the country side and on each side of the road up ahead were guard rails with woody swamps on each side. My headlights lit up the reflectors on the guard rails all the way down them. About mid way down the rail I saw a black space, almost like a gap in the rail. Once I got a little closer I realized it was some type of animal. It looked hairy, and as if it were standing over the rail crossing it. But before I got close enough to see, it had went into the woods. But it was big and I honestly didn't really know what it was, so I didn't think much of it until, about a week or so ago. I was leaving my house heading to work, it was about 8:30 or 9 in the morning.There was a very lite rain. I pulled out onto the highway (same one I had the first sighting on) and as soon as I pulled out about 200 to 300 yards I saw something weird looking on the side of the road, something out of place. As I started down the road it slowly walked out on the highway and took its time walking across the road, then stepped over the guard rail (same one as first sighting). It did this with ease. It walked down the ditch and into the woods. At this point it was about 150 yards in front of me. Its pretty open where it walked out so I got an okay look at it, but it was still a couple hundred yards out. Things that caught my attention were the way it seemed to walk. It had short legs and a longer upper body. Its head stuck up away from the shoulders. The arms hung beside it and hands were nearly touching the knees. It was all black. At first sight I was just like, that's a man, but the closer I got the more I realize how different it looked. How much bigger it appeared. Plus it came from the woods, walked across the road into a swampy area. With no cars or anyone around. It just seemed out of place to me. That's what made me focus on more detail. You could tell it didn't have clothes on because it was just one slick figure. Not baggy from jackets/ pants/ etc. Not to mention it was rainy and around 30 degrees that morning. Whatever it was, I had never seen and I hunt all the time in the woods. But I will say it was defiantly not a bear or any human I've ever seen before. This thing was big and it gave you a chill just seeing it. I'm going back tomorrow to see if I can find any hair that may of caught the rail or any tracks, just anything that catches my eye. I want to believe they are really out there and seeing this was amazing.

"When my aunt was about 11 or 12 years old, she was helping her older cousin (Jerry) in the field at her aunt's house in an area called ""Screamer"" in Henry County, Alabama.  It was a hot day, and after some time Jerry grew very thirsty and asked my aunt to walk up the road to the house and get him a glass of water.  My aunt then walked through the field back toward the dirt road leading to her aunt's house.  Upon reaching the dirt road, she saw two creatures standing on the other side of the road.  She stopped and began slowly backing up, then stopped again.  She stood there looking at them, and they looking at her, for a minute or so, long enough for her to get a good look at them.  They were only around 10 feet away from her at that point - she on one side of the dirt road and they on the other.  She described them as standing next to each other.  One was, in her estimation, around 5 feet tall and the other was slightly shorter, around 4 feet tall.  She said that she got the impression that they were young.  She said that they were ""real hairy"" and completely covered in dark brownish black hair, that they looked sort of like gorillas but with human looking faces with hair on them, human looking hands, and human looking feet.  She said their noses were free of hair and that the color of their noses was dark brown or black, as were their feet and hands.  They stood very still other than blinking, just looking at her.  Except for being covered in thick hair, their faces looked human with regular human-looking noses.  After a minute or so, she took off running as fast as she could back up to the house to get the water Jerry had requested.  She did not look back as she ran.  She got the water, and proceeded to walk back toward the field.  The creatures were not there anymore.  She never told anyone about this incident until just a couple of months ago because she was always afraid people would make fun of her.",Specific instructions omitted for privacy reasons.,Henry County,Alabama,Summer,31.651,-85.19265,12/31/14,44986,Class A,49.07,41.845,34.62,0.36,Overcast until evening.
"I was night fishing for catfish from a boat dock at the end of a dead end road adjacent to a wildlife refuge. It was middle of summer and the Mosquitoes were really bad so I decided to wait until after dark to go because they usually calm down after sunset. I had been fishing awhile with no luck when I started noticing something moving in the edge of the water, it was a river otter. I had never seen one before so I just sat and watched it for awhile. It was eating something maybe crawfish or muscles, I'm not sure but it was there for quite awhile. While watching it I started noticing large yellow eyes that I assumed was an owl. I would just catch a glimpse of them and when I would turn to look at them they would disappear. This went on for 30-45 minutes. All of a sudden the otter shot away from the bank and I saw something grey move from behind a bush to behind a cedar tree. The distance it covered was about 15 feet and it did it in a second and made no noise. I didn't get a clear look it happened so quick, but whatever it was was big (if it was a side view like I assume from the direction of travel it was thick maybe 2 foot). Within 3-4 seconds after disappearing behind the cedar tree something big hit the water about 5 feet from the end if the dock where I was sitting and a fear came over me like nothing I've felt before.

"Sunday morning around 9 am I was driving on the beach express heading north. It was a beautiful morning. Sun shining and clear. There is an area of nothing but trees and brush which goes on for a mile or two. After that the road goes into a ""s"" turn which is probably a mile or so in length. Coming into the last right hand part of the s turn, I saw what I first thought was a man running from the left to the right across the highway. I thought, ""what is this guy doing running across the highway out here?"" I could see shoulders moving and arms swinging. It was upright and fast, but I couldn't see any other detail from my distance. It just seemed really dark brown or black. I couldn't make out shoes or clothing or skin. Whatever it was, it did not slow down once it had made it across the road. It continued at the same speed into the trees. I slowed down almost to a stop where it appeared to enter the trees.

"I was driving a VW bus so I had a good view of my surroundings. As I rounded the first corner of the exit I noticed what I thought was a big white dog, like an Afghan running on all fours toward the road, up an embankment. We both reached the same point at the same time and I thought I would hit the dog. It seemed it didn't notice my car until it reached the side of the road when it was only feet away from the car. I don't remember slowing much but I wasn't going very fast to start with as the curve was pretty tight. As the creature reached the road and I saw it, it stood up on it's back legs. It was covered with long white hair maybe 8 inches long, it wasn't thick but more stringy and dirty looking and it had a round head, not a dog.  I passed the creature and didn't catch it in my mirrors as it was dark. It scared me.I didn't get much detail of it's face but I did notice a fairly large mouth or lips which were prominent.

"i want to start this off by saying, I don't know what I saw. I know it wasnt a bear. Having said that I don't know what to think. I am attaching a google doc that has pictures of what we found... So this last Saturday at about 12:30 my hunting partner and I went to Smittle cave conservation area to scout and see what conservation has cleared. We crossed a creek bottom to where there are small food plots. Once we crossed to the other side of the field we saw something on the trail about 150 to 200 yards off. even from that distance I could see it was big. I noted a head by a limb that I judged was maybe 5 or six feet of the ground. what we saw then crouched and sort of swayed a few times before taking off to the right and stopping. not being sure what we saw we crossed into the next field and discussed what it was, we turned around and went back to the field we had seen the creature and it was gone. We crossed back to where it had been and found a large fresh footprint. I put my foot down next to the print. I wear a size 10 1/2 and the print is way bigger than my foot. We estimate it to be 16 or 18 inches long.  In that same area we found broken trees that had been pulled up and then wove between other trees. What does that? Also the limb we thought was maybe five or six feet off the ground was more like 8 foot maybe 9. What we saw was big and when it moved it almost glided. It was dark gray with brown hair, it was bipedal. I couldn't make out facial features or say 100 percent what it was. We were too far away.",it is at Smittle Conservation Area near Grovespring.

"I was hiking in the woods, doing occasional whoops and wood knocks to try to illicit a response. It felt so squatchy from the moment I got there, but I got no response to anything. I was about an hour into my trek and I see off the beaten path a series of footprints. The snow had stopped yesterday and I tell you these prints were FRESH. I am thinking I just missed that squatch by a matter of minutes or hours! SO CLOSE! Well, let me tell you what!! These things were 12'' long and the stride between steps was measured at 8 feet! The line of prints was straight, just like you see with other evidence of a bigfoot trail! It was INSANE. There were no other prints around, I followed these about a quarter mile into the depths of the woods and off the beaten path. The snow was up past my knees at some points but how could I stop following this epic trail! I could see some prints more clearly than others, I could see toe outlines and the heel in a few! I have pictures and videos to share with you. By the looks of the size of the prints and the distance in stride, this seems like an adult sasquatch, These things were huge!!

"I research mountain lions in NH, but I was caring for my mother and hadn't gotten out since Christmas Day, 2014. On 5/24/15 I decided to just go for a walk, no research. I did a Meet-up with someone who walked much faster than me. She left me at the power line. I was way downhill, but was determined to at least make it to the power line. I did, but when I turned back to go down to the car, I saw two huge prints near a tree by the trail. When I got to them, the heels were 3-4 inches deep in the soil and leaves. They touched and the toes went out and away from each other like a duck's feet. They seemed to be 15 inches long, but it was hard to tell with all the leaves, unevenness, grass, etc. I took photos and measurements (even on a walk I take a camera and tape measure). It was interesting as hiding by that tree the Futures Trail went right past the tree, above was the power line and behind the tree was the park road, so that it was an advantageous hunting spot as animals coming from six different directions could easily be hunted down. Going back to the car, I saw two more tracks to the right of the trail. One was about 10 inches. The other seemed to be 15 inches, but with a 10 inch track inside it. The toes were 5 inches across for the three toes that were embedded in the bank. The other toes were over the hardened trail. There was also a 5x6 inch parallelogram shape. I kick myself now as I didn't take a photo. Later I saw a knuckle-walking gorilla on TV and thought, ""That's what that was!"" It was a knuckle print and also was very deep. At the bottom I asked the ranger to do a casting and he said I could instead, so I bought plaster of Paris. It wasn't enough. I had to go back several days later (rain). The casts are awful. There were too many leaves, the toes broke off, etc. The interesting part was that the park ranger acknowledged the report with a ""Yeah, we get lots of reports of bigfoots, but we try to keep it on the down low."" When I asked him about mountain lion sightings, he seemed scared and said, ""You think there are mountain lions up there?"" It was odd that bigfoot was ""normal"" and mountain lions were ""strange""! When I came back, I heard from someone else that this same ranger had been followed down the hill by something he nicknamed Roy. He was hoping it was a bigfoot and not a lion.

"My wife and I have a cabin just off the Wind River Hwy on Leete Road for weekend and vacation use. Saturday evening we arrived about 8:00 p.m. and after unpacking the car we walked out to road out front of the cabin, and noticed a very heavy musky skunk like odor. Our brown lab ""Sadie"" caught the scent too and started to look around for it, but it seemed to disappear quickly. About one hour later 9:00ish p.m. I stepped outside with my porch with my dog; hoping to see the planet Jupiter, but it was still behind the trees to our south. It was then that behind our property to the east in the direction of County Rd 60 I heard three distinct and loud animal calls that made a Whoo-Up! sound. It sounded like a person trying to imitate a bird call. I have never heard a sound like this ever in my life, and I am familiar with several Pacific Northwest animal sounds. This unnearved me a little, and caught the dog's attention. I quickly moved the dog inside the cabin, and had my wife put on her shoes to come outside and listen. We waited for about 20 minutes, but did not hear the animal calls again. The only sounds we heard then were the neighbors down the road playing some music, and muffled voices. Bigfoot? I don't know.

"My girlfriend and I both had Friday off, 5/15/20, and decided to go do one of our favorite hikes up to Silver Star Mountain in Skamania County, Washington. We live in Portland and go up to that hike at least once or twice a year. We regard it as one of our favorite hikes in the area due to its proximity to home and its sheer beauty. I was born in rural SW Missouri, and then spent my formative years growing up in Colorado. I am an avid outdoorsman and spend a large amount of time backpacking, hiking, camping, snowboarding and surfing in the wilderness (as well as my girlfriend). I went to school for/work in environmental science and have years of experience collecting data in nature, including animal tracking and navigation. We left around noon and arrived at the Grouse Vista Trailhead and began our hike at 1PM. The hike is around 6.8 miles roundtrip and can be challenging on the way up due to the 2,000 feet of elevation gain to the top of Silver Star Mountain. The trailhead was filled with cars, although most of the foot traffic we encountered was on the way up as others were headed down. We like to hike in the afternoon for this very reason. We are both active/fit and didn’t stop on the way up except for once when nature called. Near the top, we encountered some snow (as was expected), but not nearly as much as the year prior. We finished the hike and were at the top of Silver Star Mountain. It was overcast with patches of sunlight, but no wind or rain and was generally pleasant. During that time, we were alone on the craggy peak and only a handful of other people were on the ridge to the south. The mountain is surrounded by valleys carving through the landscape on all sides. My girlfriend is in the medical field as was on call that day. She was digging through her backpack for her work phone to check voicemails (we had very limited service). I was rummaging through my pack for snacks. It was during this time that I heard the first series of very strange noises from the closest valley to the north. It was a distinct and loud “whoooo-ooop whooo-ooop”. The first “whoooo” segment of the noise was deep, with second “ooop” part having an extreme pitch change that I could not correlate to a known animal. I ask my girlfriend if she heard it, but she was preoccupied with her phone. It was around this time that a couple of other hikers showed up with their dog. We wanted to sit out on the rocks overlooking the views, so we moved slightly further down the ridge from them to a rock outcrop and ate some snacks and took photos (I can provide these photos for reference). In between conversation, the noise happened again from the same spot in the valley to the north. It was about 15 minutes from the first one. It was loud and filled the entire valley, giving me the feeling that it was a rather large animal. My girlfriend heard it this time and we both looked at each other puzzled. The other hikers behind us were carrying on conversation and didn’t seem to be paying attention to the noise, but their dog had kept going to the ridge and looking to the direction of the noise. We waited in silence to hear it again, but never did. We decided to head back down the trail. About halfway back down, the trail passes beneath Pyramid Rock. We had always wanted to scramble this rock to see the views and felt energized that day to do so. Pyramid Rock is comprised of loose talus and can be dangerous to climb. We picked our line going up the north side of the rock, which was rather steep, and came to a shallow cave toward the top. It was probably 20 feet wide and 20 feet high, but maybe only 10 feet deep. There were remnants of a campfire here, as well as a 4-foot wall or blind made of stacked rock around the entrance. After making it to the top, we decided we were hungry so we high-tailed it back home. Upon returning home, I decided to check BFRO for reports from Silver Star Mountain and found Reports #13115, #1652. These reports are from the exact area we were in. The photos included in Report #13115 were taken from the top of Silver Star Mountain where we were sitting and heard the noises. I would also like to note that the first few seconds of the Berry-Morehead “Whoops and Knocks” audio here on BFRO are nearly identical to what we heard that day.","The summit of Silver Star Mountain that we hiked to via the Grouse Vista Trailhead.

"I went on a 6 mile hike starting at the Marble Mountain Sno-Park via the worm flows route south of Mount St. Helens. At 9:30am 1/2 mile up the trail I stopped for some water and stepped over to look at the rock pit. While stepping back to the trail I heard  loud wood knocking sounds for about 10-15 seconds. I listened for a few more seconds and then got my phone out to record the knocking sounds. In my recordings you can hear one powerful knock followed by faint knocking sounds. In my longer video I believe three different knocking locations can be detected. Starting with one loud strike of a tree followed by faint knocking and then a more muffled hit followed by the same faint knocking sounds. Hoping to video anything moving around, I decided to continual my hike going up another 2.5 miles until inclement weather rolled in. I made it back to my truck at 4pm without seeing or hearing anything else. With me being the only one parked at the Sno-Park when I started my hike it's clear nobody was near me at the time of the knocking.

About 10 seconds after I did these calls, we heard a long howl that lasted about 5 seconds in length. We are convinced that this could possibly be a Bigfoot howl.

"Background:  I have spent a large part of my life in the woods between Eddington where I grew up and Deblois where my Grandfather built a hunting / fishing camp in the 1920s – everywhere in between hunting, fishing, camping and hiking.  I have walked those woods since I was 4 years old and I’m now 61 – I know the deer, moose , bear and other wildlife of those woods.  I built my camp on Spectacle Pond in Osborn in 1988.  I have spent a lot of time in the years since exploring the woods and waters around the camp over the years and know the area between Route 179 and Route 193 better than most and within 10 miles of my camp, better than anyone.  Since 2008 when I retired from the U.S. Navy, I have spent one month every year at my camp – 2 weeks in May, fishing and 2 weeks in November, hunting.  I have spent many days and nights in the most remote areas of that part of Maine. On the evening of November 12th  2020, my wife and I had returned to our camp after an afternoon deer hunt, it was dark by the time we got back to camp and settled in for a routine evening with getting the camp warmed up, supper, a couple hands of cribbage and talking – we had been in camp for 10 days.  At around 8:30 my wife decided to go to bed as we planned to hunt the morning.  I picked up my book and was reading until 10:30.  The only light within a half mile of my camp was the single gas light in the front room of the camp which I was using to read – the nearest people were 0.5 mile away in their camp back toward Route 9.  I decided to call it a night at 10:30 and wanted to relieve myself before I went to bed so I went outside across the porch, down the front steps and walked approximately 15 feet to the back outside corner of the camp.  Within seconds of standing in that spot there was two very loud “THWACK” sounds just inside the woodline which is 15 yards across the back yard.  It took me by surprise as I’ve never heard that sound before completely by myself in the woods.  It sounded identical to someone taking a large stick of firewood and hitting a tree in full swing.  I could easily replicate that noise as in knocking snow/ice off firewood against a tree, but with force.  I did not have a flashlight with me as the diffused light from the gas light inside the camp gave me enough point of reference to get back inside so I didn’t think to bring one with me.  I stood there perplexed as to what I had just heard and trying to make sense of it, when it happened again…”THWACK” but this time a little farther away – maybe 25-30 yards, but still quite loud.  This repeated itself 10 or 11 times over a period of maybe 2 to 3 minutes, each time a little more distant than before.  I remained standing there as I was still trying to figure out what it was “THWACKing” these trees.  After the hitting of trees dissipated, I returned to the camp and locked the door – I didn’t (and still don’t) know what it was but I knew it wasn’t a person, moose, deer or bear!  Of note, there was absolutely no light as in a flashlight from a person.  Additionally, those woods are extremely thick with dead spruce and fir – lots of blowdowns yet there was absolutely no noise – no snapping branches, breaking twigs. Nothing – Silence.  I can tell you first hand that nobody could walk down through there in broad daylight, much less at night without a flashlight without snapping branches and making a lot of noise. I spent an additional hour in the camp that night reflecting on what I had heard and trying to attribute it to something that made sense – there was none in all of my experience.  I went to bed and when we got up Friday morning, we decided to hang out at camp to get a start on packing and cleaning as we were closing up camp and leaving on Saturday.  I walked into the woods during daylight where I heard the “THWACK” noises the night before but found nothing where I expected to see some type of sign.  Needless to say, I didn’t tell my wife about those events until Saturday morning as we were getting ready to leave. I still have no idea what it was and it was so dark, I didn’t see anything but I can tell you that I’ve never heard or experienced anything like that in the many years I’ve spent in those woods and the 30+ years I’ve owned that camp.","Spectacle Pond, West of Kingman Brook",Hancock County,Maine,Fall,44.78159,-68.2283,11/12/20,67335,Class B,58.66,45.71,32.76,0.92,Overcast throughout the day.
"While on vacation with my wife in northern NH/ME area called Lake Aziscohos. we decided to go moose antler hunting to find some dropped racks. while heading into a clearing we started following moose tracks, we went further past the clearing and came to a small water run-off ditch.

"Had a sighting yesterday. Oxford County, Maine. Was in the power lines clearing that runs through a friends land cutting a downed tree out of the atv trail. Was with 2 friends who asked me how far the land goes and if anyone lives down there. They had a sort of 1000 yard stare down the power lines. I look up to see what they were looking at and about 200 yards down the powerlines we see a massive bipedal creature walking towards us. It stopped when it noticed us and took a fast left turn into the woods. From the power lines to the road is roughly 400 ft of woods and has a trail about 30 feet behind where we saw the creature that goes straight to the road. I jumped on the 4 wheeler and made a straight shot down that trail to the road to try and get a closer view. It was completely gone. Made 400 ft through the woods and across the road out of sight in less than 2 minutes. While investigating the sand on the side of the road for prints we heard a short howl followed by 2 sets of 3 tree knocks.","[ 44.348740, -70.618439 ]",Oxford County,Maine,Fall,44.34113,-70.61507,9/26/20,66109,Class A,77.86,67.355,56.85,0.35,Clear throughout the day.
"I was not in any way aware that these creatures existed in Maine, firstly. I am from Connecticut however I have spent years in desolate oilfields across the U.S. including places like West Texas, the upper Peninsula of Michigan, and the Everglades of Florida. I have a vast knowledge of wildlife as I have always taken an interest to it and spent years IN the forest. My point is, what I experienced this day has shaken me to the core as I know my encounter was nothing ""normal"". In the Northwoods of Maine in a town called Greenbush, (population 1,400) I purchased 80 acres of wilderness with virgin forest on the back half of the lot. (meaning not even loggers have been there, it's that desolate.) I had rented an excavator and for this entire day I had been cutting a road through swamp, hills and forests to a high hill I call Hope Hill on the virgin most desolate corner of my land where I want to build my cabin. I had made it halfway and in the swamp I realized I was out of fuel. I shut down the machine and get out. I step down onto to road and was admiring my work and just relishing in the whole idea of pioneering this new path. Suddenly about 50 yards into the tree line I hear a bang with a stick on to a tree. Like someone was hitting a wooden bat against a large tree trunk as the percussion was unmistakable... At first I thought ""Oh crap there is a moose"" because it is mating season for them and they are known to ram their antlers against trees to intimidate their foes. Suddenly, the sound happens again. Now I am certain this is no moose as no branches are breaking, there is movement, no grunts, nothing... Just this wooden thump just through the trees where I can't see. I begin walking further away because I'm obviously freaked out. Again, but now 2 knocks... I grab a large branch I had just ripped down with the machine and smacked it against a large tree trunk. Immediately I received a knock in response. I wait around 45 seconds.... I knock again, BANG it knocks right after me again... I knock again 5 seconds later, it responds again right back.... Now I am shaking because I know what I presume this creature to be. It's obviously strong because the bang was very loud. Intimidating... I knew there was a certainty I was interacting with Sasqauch. I went back to my trailer on my qaud which was parked about 200 feet down the trail. I FLEW home. I calm down, now I am questioning reality and am quite, scared I guess. This is my land, I'm only halfway through making the road, these are my thoughts, so I decide to ride back... I knock again. It responds. I take my phone out. Turn on record on video, I knock, it goes away... Almost as if it knew I was recording. Regardless it was incredibly perplexing. I got back on the quad and went back home knowing for sure what I just experienced was legitimate. I brought a feather bead string thing from a dream catcher and brought it out there as a gift. It's been 3 days. I haven't gone back to see if it's still there.",Heavily wooded wilderness miles off Route 2 into the old logging camps.

We lived up off of Brock Bridge Road parallel to the Baltimore-Washington Parkway and one evening out with the dog out back - our home backed up to woods - I hear a rustling noise behind what was a drainage pond for our community. It was summer and the sun was getting ready to go down so it was dusk-like -- I turned - and by the way so did the dog - our Labrador Retriever -  and could not believe my eyes. I observed a large - I am guessing 10-11 feet high - ape-like figure stalking in the woods behind the pond - I would say it was about 100 yards away.  I just froze - and so did our dog.  No one else witnessed this and we just both stood there for what seemed like 2 minutes - until the creature turned and looked our way and then slowly turned and dashed back off in to the woods....never to be seen again.

"In mid spring of this year, I was hiking through the woods with a friend in the middle of the night. Making our way up onto a trail, we stumbled upon a picnic table and decided to sit down and rest. We were startled to find the whole ground glowing green around us. Using my headlamp, we attempted to spot whatever was causing these little glowing green dots. At the time we had no clue what was causing this to happen, but we later realized that firefly larvae were lighting up the forest floor. Seeing the glows coming more intensely from a nearby hillside deeper in the woods, we decided to scan the the hillside with our headlamp. As soon as we shined the headlamp, we caught a pair or grapefruit sized bright green (with a slight hint of gold) eye reflections peering over the crest of the hill. We stood in shock, never removing the light from those eyes. ""Maybe its a deer,"" she said. A few moments later the eyes raise up to be about 5 off the ground and rotate slightly more towards us. ""See,"" I say, ""It is just a deer."" As soon as that last word leaves my mouth the eye reflections stand up another 4 feet to be standing at a towering 9 feet. It slowly occurred to be that I had never seen eye reflections of this color and that the closest thing might be a bear. Suddenly I hear a slight rustling behind me. Swinging the light around we caught the reflections of two more sets of eyes. They too were grapefruit sized and green, but were spookily sneaking up on us from behind. I get caught in a frenzy of shinning the light back and forth between all three sets of eyes until they just quietly disappear. we hurried out of the area, terrified, and made our way south to a different hiking area to take the whole situation in. Again we noticed firefly larvae, but when we began to approach the woods (which in fact are connected to the last area by water system) a bunch of creatures began running around in the woods, breaking branches and shaking bushes and trees. Later, upon watching one of your videos and discussing the experience with some knowledgable peers, I realized that I had experienced a sasquatch encounter.

It was about 20 yrs ago. in Roscommon Mich. on M-18 just south of the town Roscommon at the sub power station. It happened at about 9pm at night in the fall. I had a friend with me that night and he saw it also. At the time we thought it was the dogman of Roscommon County. But of the the years I have been thinking about it and seeing your show and the people seeing them in Michigan I am now really believing it was a bigfoot. If this interests you let me know.

"On August 1st, 2020, my 3 sons and I were out for a day-trip drive along the Lake Huron shoreline, north of Lexington, MI. There's many stretches of wooded areas on the lake side of the road, and rural farmland on the west side, along this route. At approximately 12:50 PM, 1 and a half to 2 miles south of Port Sanilac, MI, we were driving northbound on M-25, and my oldest son (15 yrs), seated next to me in the front, said ""Oh my God"" and stared straight ahead. I was still driving, and asked him what was wrong. He didn't initially answer and his 13 year old brother (seated behind him in the backseat) also asked him what was the matter. He finally spurted out ""I just saw a bigfoot!"". I thought he was joking at first, as he's always been a notable skeptic of my interest in Sasquatch research. But he adamantly insisted he wasn't kidding and described what he saw in the woods on the east side (Lakeside) of the road. He said he saw a large dark figure walking south through the woods. He says it was too a dark in the canopy of the woods to see a face, but the reason he noticed it at all was that it was moving exactly like the figure ""in that old grainy footage that everyone always talks about"" (the Patterson footage). He says the arms were longer than its torso and that he could tell it had fur much in the same way you can tell a dog has fur from a distance, that it wasn't skin that he was seeing. It was definitely walking, not standing still, and it's arms were swinging. He guesses that it was around 100 yards or less away. He estimates that it was around 8 feet tall (he said his impression of it made him feel short. My son is 6' 2""). He says it had very broad shoulders. He was able to watch it for approximately 5 seconds as we traveled in the opposite direction that it was headed. As soon as he told me what he'd seen, I turned around and drove back to the location. Traffic was moderately steady, being a summer Saturday afternoon, so it took a couple minutes to return to the exact spot and then find a safe spot nearby to pull off. We didn't see anything at that point, but I pinned the area on my GPS.

"My son-in-law and I were hunting across from Clear Lake a few miles off Hwy 94 next to Green Lake. We were running our hounds on coon that night. There is a lot of country past Green Lake up into the Hickey Marsh and eventually the Seney. I had noticed partridge remains where we parked. I didn't think about. The hounds were gamey right out of the box. I cut a young hound and proven hound in. Both with a lot of grit. When they struck I had the feeling we weren't running coon but rather a bobcat. It took about twenty minutes and they treed. We proceeded into the dogs and right before the tree the critter bailed. Cats bail when they see lights like bear do at night when we run them. The dogs pulled tree and gave chase again. Treeing deeper. Way deeper. My son-in-law went to the truck to holler me out if needed. I kept the the tracker with me. I'm now in marsh with a mixture of spruce, cedar, bog and popple. The dogs treed deep. I went to a high spot to vantage my hearing on them. A thick wooded ridge. My radio tracker could barely read them and barely read the extra collar at the truck. Its range in wooded areas is about 7 miles. I kept swinging it around slowly trying to gain a good reading. I could smell something foul but thought it was myself after falling in swamp muck on more than one occasion. Again while swinging my tracker my coonlight in the direction of the antenna I noticed in the spruce a set of eyes next to the deer run on this ridge. Coon hunting you see a lot of different eye shine. I shrugged and swung the tracker, when I swung back into the trail toward the truck the trail was filled with animal twenty feet in front of me. It was around 8 feet tall long arms with fingers, barrel chested and pot bellied. The eyes were close and deep set but aggressive in its gaze, the mouth was agap. My goodness the ears were small. I froze in my tracks, I lost my training of the hounds call. We just looked at each other frozen. It grabbed a very large spruce, wrapping its hand around it. Its hair was black to brown not long, not short, the nose flat, with a face not covered in hair like its body. I really don't remember how it left. I remember the smell followed me almost all the way to the truck just up a trail where my son-in-law met me. He commented I passed gas jokingly. I was very shaken. I had a hard time reading my tracking system on the way back, I doubted my compass. It wasn't the straightest path back. To this day I haven't ran the hounds up there for or or bear since. As well it was the only time I left my hounds in the woods. In the morning after sleeping a bit I rode up {nervous as hell } to try and find the hounds by myself as my son in law went to work. Thank the lord they were treed in the beechwoods 30 feet off the gravel road with the prettiest sleeping bobcat you ever seen in the tree.",28 miles north of Manistique off Hwy 94,Schoolcraft County,Michigan,Summer,46.19183,-86.21193,8/15/10,31025,Class A,74.2,65.19,56.18,0.21,Mostly cloudy starting in the afternoon.
While hunting in the Pinckney State Recreation Area during the last week of deer season my hunting partner and I heard loud whooping or howlling type noises similar to those heard in recordings on this site along with bi-pedal type foot steps through heavy brush. The sound of the foot steps were very heavy and we could hear branches breaking as it moved around.  My partner and I were a few hundred yards apart and the noise came from a thick cover between our spots.  We both heard it as my partner called me on the two way asking if I could hear it too.  I don't know that it was a bigfoot however it was scarry enough for me to remove the safety from my gun and actually swing in the direction it came from knowing my partner was in that direction as well.  I have continued to hunt the area since then and have had no further incident. .,Crooked Lake Rustic Camp Grounds near the lake.,Washtenaw County,Michigan,Fall,42.43235,-84.2915,7/14/11,28023,Class B,79.3,70.495,61.69,0.48,Clear throughout the day.
"Last night on Sept 2nd my friend was outside with with her 7 pound dog when I stepped out to smoke with her. We both heard a grunting sound, we got scared and ran inside. The next day we went looking in the area where it had come from and we found bushes pressed down at what appeared to be a heel print. I took a couple photos of it. That night we went out and tried to do wood knocks and howls  after about five sets off knocks (I was doing knocks of two and three hits) we heard a distinct wood knock back, it sounded like when a baseball player hits a ball solid. I proceeded to knock and howl and we heard thuds like something hitting the ground. We also heard movement thru the woods and in a stream. We are going to go back and try some more knocks to see if we can add to the story.","East Fouch Road, Traverse City, MI",Leelanau County,Michigan,Summer,44.83369,-85.72845,9/2/13,42056,Class B,59.31,57.98,56.65,0.91,Overcast throughout the day.

"We were on our yearly camping trip to Tippy dam pond, I believe its outside of Manistee. Its very remote, you have to travel down many back dirt roads to get to the campground .We have went camping up at Tippy dam for years, always in the spring to do a lot of fishing, day and night fishing. It was after midnight when we got up there in 2012 and we set up tents and the girls all went to sleep. Me and my brother and 12 yr old son took the boat out for some night fishing. We got back into this cove, the Tippy dam pond is huge, they call it the flooded forest. Its beautiful you could swear you were in Canada, very hilly. Huge hills back up to the water but all forest in every direction, very very remote. We were fishing sitting in the dead quiet when all of a sudden we were scared out of our minds!!! A huge rock that must have been the size of a bowling ball was thrown at are boat. At first we blew it off as if it were a fish jumping all though the distinct sound of a round ball hitting water is unmistakeable. So about 3 mts. went by when another one was thrown even closer to the boat. There was no way this was a fish, we shined a flashlight through the woods and could hear something moving fast thru the brush but could not make out what it was ..this area we were fishing is so remote there is no way any human would be out there let alone in the middle of the night ..I've never seen my brother scared, we are Michiganders, we deer hunt yearly spend days in the woods but we were scared that night. Something did not want us in that lil cove fishing and it was hurling huge rocks at us ta get us outta there and it worked lol.

"About 2 years ago, sometime during warm weather, my husband and I were sleeping with our window open.  It was very early morning, and my husband was startled awake by a very high pitched screaming sound.  I was awakened just a few moments later by the same sound.  It sounded like a terrified woman, or a child's high pitch scream.  My husband was very scared, as he thought it was our 3 year old daughter that had climb out of her window and was walking on the dark road.  He ran downstairs to check on her and found her and our 2 year old son asleep in their rooms.  While he was checking on them, I heard the scream again.  My husband and I had never heard that sound before.  It gave us chills.  The next day, curiosity got a hold of me.  I started searching online for that sound, and came across supposed Bigfoot screams.  It sounded the exact same.  We even looked up screech owl noises, and many of the other noises that people have said this scream is.  Although the noises came close, nothing matched exactly, except the supposed Bigfoot screams.  That was the last we heard of those noises until recently.  The current situation is actually happening at my dad's house, which is about 2 miles if you take the road, and maybe 1-1.5 miles straight shot, from our house.  He moved to that house about 3 months ago.  A few weeks or so after he moved into the house, he told me one morning that he heard this screaming sound the night before that he had never heard before, and that it gave him chills.  I jokingly said that it was Bigfoot.  Well, one day I was watching Finding Big Foot at my dad's house, and he heard the sound that the cast had heard in the woods, and MM said was a Bigfoot.  He came into the room and said, ""that's the sound I heard, what was that?""  -He did not know the name or content of the show I was watching.  My dad has said that a few times since, he has heard that same sound.  He also said that his dog, who is a lab mix, usually starts growling and the hackles on his back stand up, when there are animals, such as deer, in the backyard or in the woods across the river.  However, he said there are times when the dog acts like he hears something in those areas, and will run back into the house and hide.  There has also been one time, about 12:30 at night, my husband was letting our dogs outside, and he came into the house, at little scared, and said that he had heard that sound again.  The next morning, my dad told us that he heard the scream again, about 12:30 at night, and we told him that we had heard it too.  The latest ""event"" and the reason that I reached out to MM, was because my dad had our kids over at his house on Monday (5/14) evening.  Earlier that day, he had taken a few panoramic pictures of his backyard as he was playing with his dog.  My kids went over to his house around 7pm.  He had them outside most of the evening, in and out, and then they ate dinner.  Sometime around 9pm, my dad noticed a very large limb sticking straight out of the ground on the bank of the river. He looked back at the picture he took earlier and the stick was not there. The stick is probably around 9'-10' tall.  It was in the ground approximately 9"".  I have attached two pictures showing this.  I am in the picture, and I am about 5'6"".   My husband got to my dad's house about 15 minutes after my dad noticed the stick.  He started walking down to the stick, and had a very uneasy feeling, and only made it half way between the house and the river, when he heard a rustling sound in the woods across the river. That was when he turned around and walked back to the house.  I got to the house about 15 minutes after that, and my husband and I walked down the the stick to look for footprints and found nothing.  My husband mentioned that he did not have the uneasy feeling that time.  We looked around and tried to see if maybe the limb had fallen from the tree, and while this is a possibility, I feel it is very unlikely.  The conditions would have had to be perfect for this to happen.  My dad said the next morning, that he thinks that the limb probably fell from the tree, but I'm not convinced.",(Removed),Mecosta County,Michigan,Spring,43.577,-85.293,5/14/12,35437,Class B,75.81,59.29,42.77,0.81,Clear throughout the day.

"We were coyote hunting and when we first sat down my buddy says “did you hear that” I said “hear what” then he said “it sounded like a wood knock” I didn’t think much of it and we went on to call for about 30 minutes. After 30 minutes of calling I stand up to sign the field edge and when I sign I see 2 huge glowing eyes like a yellowish bright color I’ve never seen before and it was high enough off the ground my first thought was the land owners put a reflective sign in a tree. So I scope in on it and I realize whatever it was, was hiding behind a tree looking around it. So my buddy’s start scoping in on it to. Then it proceeded to crouch down low to the ground and look around the other side of the tree. Then it disappeared for about 10 seconds then popped up 10 yards to the right of where it first was and it was looking around a tree again and when we all scoped in on it we all clear as day witnessed it crouch down like a person and it vanished.

"It was summer 2010, my girlfriend and I were saying our goodnights to each other and she left the loft in the garage. It was about midnight; she texted me about 5 minutes after she left about a banging noise. She thought it was me making those noises to scare her. And then a chill ran down my back, because the sound she was hearing was not from me. I told her it was not me and I was a little frightened at first and I did not hear the noise at all for the rest of the night. The next night around the same time, I was walking her home and her and I both heard the same noise. At first we did not mind until we heard it again, and it was closer. We rushed back inside and left the upstairs windows open to listen. We heard the banging noises multiple times, each time getting closer and closer. We kept on hearing leaves crackling like something was walking around and we could tell it was walking on two legs because it was a steady, slow walking pace. We shined the flashlight out the window but due to the trees, we could not see it.

"In Montcalm county Michigan a group of friends, my dog and I were walking down a dirt road that is adjacent from my grandparents cottage near (removed). The time was roughly eleven thirty when we set out for a late night walk, our plans were to walk down to the paved road that intersects the dirt road and back to the cottage. We were on our way back to the cottage and should I say this dirt road we were on runs right through a very dense woodland area that is almost dark in the day time due to the canopy of the trees above road, so at night our line of vision ended as soon as the trees began on the side of the road. Over my friends chatter and occasional laughter  I heard something that sounded rather large following us from behind us to the left, which was the side I was walking on. Whatever that was following us would only move at strategic times when my friends would get a bit too loud or started scraping their feet on the road.  I had the group stop and turn around to face the direction of the noise. One friend got close to me and whispered (removed) look over by that mailbox, and as I turned my head to the left the see what he was talking about I seen a large somewhat illuminated figure slowly walking in a small circle, almost dancing in a way, this really interested me. As soon as the groups attention was focused on the moving figure, I heard a low in volume not threatening grunt. We turned around to see a large pair or red almost orange eyes looking down at us from just within the woods. We stood there and watched it watch us for a few short moments then one friend took off running back to the cabin. As he took off the eyes, still looking directly at me seemed to retreat back into the woods a few yards then got low to the ground continuing to go further and further into the woods. I watched the eyes then disappear, so we walked back to the cottage.

"I think it was in the spring of about 1998-99, my ex-husband woke me up at about three in the morning. We lived in Atlanta at the time, which is about half way between Gaylord and Alpena.

I went with him to the sliding glass door on the back porch and heard the most God-awful sound I have ever heard in my life.

"I am writing this for my neighbor Bill (not his real name). I interviewed Bill on December 25, 2010, and for additional details two times again. Bill said that when he was a teenager he went with a group of 11 relatives and neighbors from Detroit camping in the upper Lower Peninsula of Michigan. They camped west of Twin Lakes in northern Kalkaska County. The group was made up of several men, about 7 boys (ages 7 to 12 years), and Bill. They arrived on a Friday morning and set up camp about 50 ft from the road and in a spot where no one else had camped. They cleared away the underbrush and built two rings of rocks for their campfires. The two rock rings were about 30 ft apart. It was early Spring because Bill recalled there were still patches of snow on the ground under the trees during this trip. In the early evening, they roasted marshmallows and hotdogs –the children sitting around one campfire and the adults around the other.  From behind where Bill was sitting, a rock was thrown into the campsite. About 15 to 20 minutes later, two more rocks were thrown into the camp in quick succession.  The rocks were about the size of cantaloupes. Each rock landed and rolled only a few feet, suggesting the rocks had been lobbed upwards rather than thrown directly into the camp. The rocks had been thrown from beyond their camp clearing. The edge of the clearing was at least 30 ft away from where the rocks landed.  With the first rock thrown, everyone thought someone from their group had thrown the rock as a prank (perhaps while taking a leak in the forest). But when they looked around and saw that everyone was at the campfires, they realized someone else was throwing the rocks. I asked Bill what their reactions were to the rocks landing in their campsite. Bill said that they were surprised and thought it was weird that someone would or could throw such large rocks but no one was alarmed. Bill said that one of the adults had a firearm in his tent, but did not get up to get it. Early the following morning, Bill got up and drove west towards State Highway 66 in order to buy some supplies. He recalls that he was driving with a learner’s permit, so one of the adults rode with him. The road they were on was a narrow hard dirt road without a maintained, clear shoulder. It was like a fire road or logging road.  Bill had driven about 10 miles west of the campsite when he saw a large animal come out of the forest on the north side of the road. It emerged from the forest on all four limbs until it reached the road. On the road’s edge, it stood up and walked across the road in two steps, the first step was in the middle of the road, the second on the other side. Because the forest edge along the south side of the road was dense, the animal immediately vanished from sight as it reentered the forest. When Bill saw the animal, the sun was behind him and still very low, the trees cast long shadows, and he was about 50 yards from where it crossed the road. So he recalls only that it was bigger than a bear, its hair was darker red than a deer, and he was impressed by the strength or force of its stride. When Bill got to the spot where he had seen the figure cross, he stopped briefly but didn’t get out of the truck because the adult he was with told him to drive on. (The adult had been sleeping when the figure crossed the road and awoke when he stopped the truck.)  Because he was driving with a learner’s permit, he was 15 years old. As such, the year was 1962. He thought about what he had seen during the rest of his trip to the store. He thought what he had seen matched descriptions he had heard or read about sasquatch, but thought sasquatch was only seen in the Pacific Northwest. He had not heard of sightings in Michigan. So when he got to the store, he asked the store owner whether he had heard of any local sasquatch sightings.","west of Twin Lakes in Kalkaska County, probably on Twin Lakes Road NE (based on the Google Earth May 12, 1994 image), east of State Highway 66",Kalkaska County,Michigan,Spring,44.76665,-85.00165,5/23/11,28668,Class A,70.87,55.965,41.06,0.71,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.

"I was camping at the Clark Lake campground in Sylvania Wilderness and went exploring the backroads of the Ottawa Natl Forest on a Saturday morning.  I thought I'd go explore Langford Lake, Pomeroy Lake, and Moosehead Lake. I was driving toward Langford Lake campground, and I took US-2 from Watersmeet and made a left onto CR 527.  About 1/2 way before I got to Langford Lake Rd., I was shocked to see what looked to be ""a monkey with a bear's body"" right in front of the car.  This ""being"" crossed the road right in front of the car.  If I hadn't have slammed on the brakes, I would have hit it!  It was NOT a bear.  I have seen tens of bears in both rural Michigan and rural Virginia over the past 30 years, some while driving and some while hiking, some even face-to-face.  This was not a bear.  All I kept thinking to myself was ""why is there a monkey in the woods? why is there a monkey in the woods?"".  I was stunned and baffled and my mind just couldn't ""figure it out"".  It was like the very first time (while in rural Virginia) I saw a cougar (up close and personal in our yard).  My mind just couldn't comprehend.  After the being crossed the road, I stopped the car and tried to look for it.  There was a small gully on the left that it must have gone down into; but I couldn't see it.  The brush was thick.  I was stunned.  My mind couldn't make sense of it all.  Here was this being, maybe 5 feet in length, dark black-brown, four-footed, running on all fours (not running like a bear runs, I've seen that too), with its underbelly about 2 feet off the ground.  Long and lean, it seemed to me.  Not running very fast, but brisk.  Of all the funny things in the world, it ""seemed"" to be ""smiling"".  It was not threatening at all.  It seemed very innocent.  No pointed head, eyes brown, not a snout.  Not a furry face.  Looked like a monkey's face.  No tail.  It all happened so fast and I wish I had been able to follow it, once it crossed the road.  This was not a bear cub - I have seen at least a half a dozen of them in my life too - climbing trees in the Adirondacks, crossing roads in central VA.  I am still baffled to this day as to what this being was; although something in my gut tells me that I saw a ""baby bigfoot"".","along CR 527, enroute to Langford Lake campground area",Gogebic County,Michigan,Summer,46.25,-89.5,7/15/12,44437,Class B,86.31,74.22,62.13,0.89,Foggy in the morning.
"I was driving home at night from one of my meetings for work, and I was on a backroad since I live in the country and it was nighttime. I heard a loud thump on my truck door and thought someone had threw something at me or that I had hit something. When I got out of the truck and walked to the other side their was scratches all down my passenger truck door. I got extremely scared so I had my dad and brother come get me, and that is when we then found footprints all along the middle of the dirt road and it went on it seems like miles. As we were taking pictures of the footsteps, we heard something. My dad shined the flashlight into the field we saw greenish looking eyes above the brust and a little off to the distance. My brother ran with the flashlight towards it, it stood there as he got closer it just disappeard and we started hearing loud knocks and a really weird growl so my dad yelled and made my brother come back.

"I’m 50 now, but when I was 15 my father had a modern cabin, I designed and drafted, in lower upper Michigan, near Gladwin, Michigan.  I saw your Michigan episode today and wanted you to know about something I saw in the woods near Streaked Lake.  I know the county pretty good as I hunted, fished and snowmobiled in the area.  We lived in Brooklyn, MI and would travel to the cabin on my dad's days off.  The winter of 77/78, don’t remember the month, my younger brother and I were out doing nighttime, off trail snowmobiling.  We were on the state park next to my dads place.  My brother was leading, we were in Cedar Pines most of them not more than 10 inches in diameter (I know this because my dad use to have me cut firewood, and poles for fences.) Snow was pretty deep and we were moving over snags pretty good at about 10 mph.  My brother took a turn ahead of me, he was about 50 feet or so in front of me, as I began my turn to follow to the left my headlight caught something next to a 6” cedar, it stood about 7 or more feet, it had its left hand on the tree, looking over its bicep at me, its body was turned toward my brother.  I thought I was seeing things but its body was showing on the other side of the tree.  A bear came to mind but then as I was watching it, a gorilla is what I thought.  As I made my turn it was about 10 feet off to my right.  I picked up speed, craning my neck as I watched it stand there following me with its head.  I caught up to my brother and told him to head back to the cabin but on the trails.   I stayed right behind him until we got back to the cabin about 20 minutes.  I never saw the thing follow so I have always been somewhat reluctant to say something.  When we got inside, I told my dad and brother what I had seen.  I was pretty terrified when I saw it and stayed that way through the night.  The next morning we took the machines back out and followed are trails in the snow.  We found some type of foot that was bigger than my dads.  To this day, after spending many years also in the Yellowstone area, after leaving the service and working for the West Yellowstone PD, and Gallatin County SAR, I cannot believe what I saw.  I have been on snowmobiles and in my truck driving the trails around the park for hunting or recreation and have seen many grizzlies of various colors, plus a bunch of elk, deer, and bison.  This object was not any of those.","Heavy Cedar Pines, off trail snowmobiling on state lands near father's cabin.",Gladwin County,Michigan,Winter,44.12,-84.50999,4/6/13,40223,Class B,41.64,40.825,40.01,0.88,Overcast throughout the day.
"My boyfriend is a hunter and a trapper. He traps trouble beaver for the county. This was about mid-Aug. He was out checking his traps out on the Chaney Lake Rd., south of Wakefield MI. He was heading south, came around the corner, saw something all black in the middle of the road. Being a bear hunter also, he hurried to see if it was a bear.

It passed in front of a curve sign, going into a swamp, that was 9-10 ft tall and only 6 inches of the sign showed above its head!! It was very black with long arms. So he got down there and it was gone. No path, no broken branches, no noise, nothing.  Now he won't go in woods without a gun. And this is a man that used to bait bear with only a 10 inch knife!!!!

"Visual incident My wife and I rented a snowmobile for the day after Christmas 12/26/2012 from Roudolph Ranch near Traverse City MI.  Our first exploration on the trip were the trails from the ranch to Traverse City.  We traveled through some forest to a high wire clearing that we felt had too much rugged terrain to continue.  We came to the first road in the high wire clearing and decided to turn around.  I was driving and my wife was riding in the passenger's seat. After turning around I looked across two hills from which we had just come and noticed what appeared on first impression, to be a cross country skier, 200 yards away, coming down the second hill away from us. Immediately many things bothered me about this cross country skier.  First, it was male and it was extremely tall, maybe 8 to 9 feet in height.  (It was very male because of its wide shoulder to slim waste shape)  Second, he appeared to traverse the steep down hill slope like a down hill skier attacking the slope in parallel skier motions but in very long foot steps instead of sliding skies in downhill parallel motion. No skies were noticed.  Third, and most puzzling, was that the figure was dark, dirty rusty, red from top of head to bottom of foot except for the face which was jet black. Finally the figure appeared very unnatural in movement. The entire sighting lasted a total of maybe 5 seconds. As I drove back over the area where I saw the figure I looked intently for cross country ski tracks.  I found none.  We also did not come across a skier and the area at the bottom of the hill dumped into a very thick wooded area blocked by a barbed wire fence. At the time I thought about stopping and looking for foot prints but was afraid of asking my wife if she saw what I thought I had just seen so I moved on. Whatever I saw bothered me all day.  Later in the evening I asked my wife if she noticed the cross country skier which I had seen. She had not seen the skier.  When I walked her through the event and told her that I think I saw a Bigfoot she just laughed and continues to laugh at me today. The sighting has continued to bother me over a month later.  I'm convinced that what I saw was too tall, was not clothed naturally, and moved too unnaturally to be a human.",I've described the location as best I can.

"I was driving south on Bird Lake Road between the intersections of Tamarack Road and Pratville Road on  September 5, 2014 around 4:30pm.  This is in Hillsdale County in Osseo, Michigan.  I had just crested a small hill when about 200-250 yards in front of me I saw a very large, reddish brown creature on two legs run across the road and into a very thick and wooded area.  This creature literally cleared the road in what appeared to be one huge step.  The sun was shining bright and it's reddish brown hair really stood out.  It appeared to me the thing had been running and maybe slowed down.  As it came out into the opening and saw me it leaped or ran across the road into the heavy thicket.  It was traveling from west to east.  As I approached where it had crossed it had already disappeared into the thick woods and brush.  I didn't look for tracks because I was so taken back by what I had just seen. Up until this time I had never believed in bigfoot or sasquatch.  Whatever I saw that day was no human or any other animal I have ever seen before.  It was very large and probably stood around 7 or 8 feet tall.  It's body mass was proportionate to it's height as well.

"My name is Michael, and I am 17.   I had a Bigfoot sighting in Michigan. I was fishing one day and I was all alone because I walked up and down the river for almost a mile and a half. I was fishing and all of a sudden a huge rock hit the water like 50 feet down from me and make quite a big splash. This is in the Whittemore Area, and I looked down the river and then this big giant apelike creature looked out over the river at me and literally scared the crap out of me it had really long hairy arms and big broad shoulders and the head on this thing was way bigger than a human. The creature stood at least 11' in the air. Then it turned and started walking into the woods, but it walked toward me. it made like 5 steps and stopped. When it walked you could hear the sticks and leaves cracking under its feet. It got quiet but too quiet. Even the birds stopped chirping. It was getting scary. So I packed up my fishing gear and started walking curiously toward the trail. I was yelling into the woods and asking ""Is there anybody there?"" but nobody answered so I started walking down the trail. on the quarter mile back to the main road. I started walking back and then I kept getting this feeling that someone was watching me or something. I turned around and as I turned around this big giant thing jumped over this barbed wire fence and ran up the hill leaving this big stump swaying aggressively. It was up and over the hill in like 5 seconds. This thing was freaken Fast! I ran up the hill but on the other side was a big field. It was gone by then. I later bumped into my Aunt my brother and my cousin. They said that they heard something walking up by this pond then they heard a low growl and then it walked away.

"I was taking trash out to my dumpster at the end of my driveway. My driveway is fairly long over 100 yards and wooded on both sides and makes a slight turn. I had a flashlight with me as performed my task. When I was returning my light was trained on the ground before me watching were I was walking. I looked up and saw something moving away from the entrance to my garage (my main door was open). I could see in the lights from inside my garage that it was at least as tall as I (6'+) and was a brownish color. I shined my light at it. It moved purposefully but not hurried, quickly but not in fear. It was upright but I don't recall seeing legs, although my light was at the upper portion of it. As it moved it almost glided (without the usual bobbing a person would make) and it was silent as it moved. I didn't notice any facial or distinguishing features. As it went behind my camper I stopped in my tracks for a moment to determine what it was I actually saw. I believed I caught a trespasser trying to rob me. I rounded the corner of the camper and shined the light at the edge of the treeline of my roundabout, and it was there again, the same form, but it moved into the treeline almost looking as it faded into them, no sound not a twig snapping. I never saw any eyes or face. I ran in to grab my rifle and told my girlfriend to lock the door behind me as I went out to where it disappeared. The area was full of dead fall trees and other brush. I tried to traverse it but had extreme difficulty in doing so, let alone without any sound. My neighboring property is a hunting cabin.  A hunting party had just returned from dinner and saw me with a flashlight and rifle clamoring through the woods to their property. Fortunately open mindedness and cool heads were abound. I explained what had happened, my neighbor stated it could have been a Black Bear walking on his hind legs looking for the garbage. It seemed plausible (I know there are bears around my house) but that explanation never did sit right. With no tracks, the form taller than a bear even on hind legs would be. I didn't see a snout and it wasn't barrel shaped more thin and human like, gliding instead of the typical wobble a walking bear does, and the total absence of sound when entering the woods. I was more convinced it was a ghost more than bear.","My house in about 3 mis north of Wurtsmith airport on 2882 F-41, I have approx 17 acres which backs up to 2500 acres of state land. there are a few houses in the area but cannot be seen from each other when the foliage is full.",Iosco County,Michigan,Fall,44.49427,-83.40396,11/14/16,59333,Class B,59.19,47.845,36.5,0.52,Foggy overnight.
I was walking from the house to a detached garage with my daughter about 2:30 am when we both seen a (human like) white furry figure approx. 100 feet from where we were.

We walked toward the figure I noticed it was still near the tree bent over slightly almost like it was trying not to be noticed. We both ran back to the garage and talked about what we saw and decided we didn't know what it was mostly because of its size and the way it moved.

"November 26th, 2016. A friend and I were taking a walk out at Days River Trail on the outskirts of Gladstone, MI.  in the Upper Peninsula. We arrived around 7 p.m.  My friend didn’t want to be there in the dark but I am an intuitive medium and I have no fear of the dark with the things I deal with. I have been to Days River Trail many times during my lifetime but only within this last year has this place been an interest to me to see what it feels like at night. We decided to walk the outer trail once we cross the bridge over the river. We took a right after the bridge and before we hit the corner we looked up and saw this light, high up to our left, up over a small ridge. It was a bright light, shining but not moving at all. Still. We took our mini flashlights and were trying to see what it was or where it was coming from and then started talking loud and it did not move, not at all. We kept walking, not long after the first corner we heard something walking to our right which is on the river side and it would have been down an embankment. It was definitely on two feet not 4. I grew up in the country and know a lot of what animals sound like.  My friend was worried and asked me what I thought, I didn’t want her to run so I said I think it’s a deer let’s keep moving.  We got farther into the woods and started looping in the inside trails and it was a beautiful night, not too cold and somewhat clear out. We came to a place where there is a bench and a fire pit. We stopped there for about an hour and just talked since we don’t see each other often. Both of us felt like we were being watched but not in a dangerous way. I usually “see” things wherever I go since I am an intuitive/medium. I couldn’t “see” anything this night just had a feeling of being watched. As we left and started walking the trail around the other side of the forest, (we would be eventually coming out to the left after the bridge.) We could smell something that was skunk like but not really. I can’t describe it.  Bad body odor? skunk?. That smell stayed with us for a bit then disappeared. As we got closer to the bridge we were both feeling like it was time to go, it was close to 10 p.m. now and BTW we were the only people out there. Typically no one walks out there alone or in groups at night.  (Just for FYI reasons to there is a meat packing plant across the road from the entrance to this trailway.) We crossed the bridge, and started hearing this “crying” noise that made the hair stand up on the back of my neck. I had never heard anything like this. I am 50. I grew up in the woods. I feel like I know animal noises. This was something different. It kept calling or crying until we got to the beginning of where we started. I felt like whatever/whoever it was didn’t want us to leave.  My friend thought it was a wounded animal. At first I did too but after listening and deciphering I know this was something completely out of my scope of what I know. I started doing research the moment I got home. I am convinced I experienced the all elusive Bigfoot. I found audio from others on Youtube that matched exactly what we heard. I went back a few days later alone during the day around 1 p.m. I decided to go directly to the left after the bridge and made my way to the area about where the  calling or crying would have come from. I stopped at this very large tree and just stood there patiently waiting. Maybe 10 minutes after I got there, I heard it again, this time it seemed farther away and less of a crying and more of a whistling , to me it felt like whatever this is was just letting me know it knew I was back. I didn’t stay long because in my intuitive vision I saw a cougar/mountain lion and know that they have been seen out here before and caught on camera. So, I thanked whatever was out there for letting me “hear” it again and went on my way to document this experience.",East on Days River 24.5 Rd from M35 until you reach the Hiking Trail Trailhead West on Days River 24.5 Rd from US2 and 41 until you reach the Days River Trail Trailhead,Delta County,Michigan,Fall,45.89259,-87.04828,11/26/16,56552,Class B,40.55,33.635,26.72,0.91,Mostly cloudy until afternoon.
"We,(FIVE OF US) planned a three day investigation on private property, some 126 acres of private property near Rock, north of Escanaba Michigan, U.P. Arriving in a predetermined site, some half mile into the described property near the Hiawatha National Forest, the working campsite was set up in a clearing, surrounded by forest and swamp land. Drone footage revealed our location to be in a remote area with opened swamp land, wooded habitation for local wildlife and full of game trails. Large cats, coyote, black bear, wolves and deer comprise the common larger wild-life in this area. Several digital cameras were set up or used during our visit to this area including GoPro, Panasonic video cam, HD drone cam, digital photo cams, trail cam, digital audio recorder and IR night vision cam and a digital SD card megaphone loaded with various sasquatch vocalizations gathered before the trip. The first night, Wednesday the 30th of May, 2018 was mainly uneventful, though I went to use a tree earlier in the day behind our campsite and happened to look down to my right and smack in the middle of a game trail were two large footprints. The prints looked older with some leaves and debris in them. Frank and Bart made a cast. During this first evening, Frank and Bart heard some physical movement in the wooded area directly behind the camp, Frank searched the tree line along the edge of the site and believes that he observed ""something"", through the IR camera, though it was not captured due to a ""battery issue"". We all entered our tents sometime after 1:30am or so. The second night, Thursday, May 31st, was a completely different experience. I still do not understand why a group of ""first timers"" with no personal Squatch research experience, schooled only by what we read about the subject and view on You Tube, would have such an incredible event happen to us. I will say few words about this experience, my partners will share their own perception of what took place. We all entered our tents some time after 2am on the second night. Ignorance and inexperience account for me not turning on the digital audio recorder before turning in. After all, we were going to sleep, nothing had happened earlier, and thinking of the next day's possibilities, I completely let everyone down, but learned a lesson. consequently, we did not capture the audio of something huge that came near us within 50+ yards or so of our camp. ""CLOSE, LOUD AND LONG""!!! A little after 4am, (we check our watches), a long and loud yell or howl, lasting at least a good 10 seconds, pierced the night, immediately followed by a pack of coyote, yelping, inter-mingled with shorter yells/howls from whatever was ""shaking"" up the forest, woke us all up in complete surprise and amazement. The length of the vocalization exceed the capability of a wolf by 5+ seconds or so. The yell was definitely not a wolf. It did not seem like this could really happen, BUT IT DID!  Once the coyote stopped their yelping, EVERYTHING went silent! no critters to be heard for sometime after. - DB Bart's testimony: MONDAY  night,  arrived set up camp, soot steps behind me, felt like something behind me, Frank looked behind me with night vision he was a bit shaken and said he saw a face. looked again with new batteries and face was gone. TUESDAY NIGHT; large scream 75 yards to south coyotes went crazy with 2 short screams. nothing I ever heard, lasted about 10 to 12 seconds om first long scream/howl,,,,,,, WEDNESDAY : am, discussed what happened in am at 4:20 determined it was bigfoot and length, distance and intensity of the owl/scream......in pm met with bigfoot expert and had lot of answers to questions...... THURSDAY;  woke up and someone noticed bones about 30 feet away. they were over a foot long looked like bones from a deer and were snapped clean and looked bleached from sun. this bothered me. someone had to of seen this sooner. all words are from journal and not to be changed or polished............. Bart Frank's testimony: Shortly after arriving at our camp site Dennis found a foot print. It was the left foot. I was able to put my fingers into the indentation of the toes. It seemed the fourth toe was missing. We also saw a light impression of another and possibly a third print not far away.  First night we were there We were sitting around the fire and Bart said there was something to his left and behind him I slowly got up and looked through the night vision camera and thought I saw a face between two small trees then the camera died. When the camera was working again I could not find it again. This was possibly 20 foot from me. I found no foot prints in that area the next day. We later went to sleep. Bart and I got out of the tent about 4:20 to go pee. We heard what sounded like a whistle it was a tone like a bird we heard earlier but sounded different. We could hear no other sound , birds or frogs.  The second night we were awaken by what I can only describe as a yell that was so loud sounding like whooooo about 10sec long with coyote yelling at the same time in the same location there were 4 or 5 short yells 2 or 3 sec that quickly followed then total silence. This sound was perhaps only 50-75 yards away That was the only time we heard coyotes at our camp before or after. We found 2 bones maybe 40 or 50 feet from our tents there were no other bones to be found so the kill was not there. In the picture you can see how one bone was broken. Frank",49880 ZIP CODE.

"I had gone to the Boundary Waters canoe area in Minnesota August 18, 2013 with a friend. As we were canoeing the first day, it got dark. It was around ten pm and we were in the middle of a lake when we had a rock thrown at us. It was thrown a good 150 yards from shore. Then about twenty minutes later as we back tracked to the car, we were in a small canal between two lakes and heard a strange noise that to me sounded like a cross between a gorilla and a duck. The noise was about 30 yards away from us. We heard it for about ten minutes and every time we shined our flashlights towards the sound,  we could not see anything.

"I need to speak to someone personally about my incident right away. I was walking alone through the Lost Forty scientific natural area near Dora Lake MN on this past Wednesday the 3rd of June 2015. Around 12 o'clock noon. Just last week as I was taking pictures of the 350 year old white pines with my camera phone. My Dad was back in the car and he honked the horn and yelled at me to come back as he was getting impatient as always. I immediately heard strange unexplainable sounds after he honked the horn. I believe he startled whatever it was back there because the sounds were getting louder after he honked the horn. I was deep in the forest and you could hear a pin drop. The sounds I heard were absolutely unexplainable for me to write down. It sounded like there must be a 500 pound woodpecker back here banging into some trees. I didn't think anything of it because nothing really scares me. I carried on, taking many beautiful pictures of the untouched white pines deep into the Lost Forty scientific and natural area. 15 minutes after my hike,I heard a tree starting to loudly crack and fall within 20 maybe 30 feet from where I was standing still. Startled, I looked all around 360 degrees to make sure it didn't fall on top of me. Just less than 20 to 30 feet away this GIANT birch tree flung back up into the air in its original upright position. The path was curved so I couldn't see around the next corner on the ground. I had less than 5 seconds as my mind was running through all the possibilities of what just happened. I have never been so afraid in my entire life and nothing ever really scares me. I thought it may be a bear at first but that tree was so big I almost ruled it out right away. I immediately ran for my life in the opposite direction as fast as humanly possible about a quarter mile back to the car. I was afraid whatever it was had been chasing me. It wasn't thank God, because halfway to the car I had to stop and catch my breath for about a minute. It seemed like I ran forever and I thought this was the end of me. As I was running back to the car my Dad heard me running through the forest huffing and puffing, and he thought I was just messing with him. He told me that ""I looked like I had just seen a ghost and, what the hell just happened?"". I drove away from that place going about 80 miles an hour. Couldn't barely breath for a half hour. I have never heard or seen or experienced anything like this in my whole life. I did not personally see it, but it saw me and must have climbed up a large birch tree causing it to bend down and crack as the creature fell to the ground. As I described the event to other people and some locals throughout the week, some said it was not a bear. They told me to watch your show on tv. I am watching your TV show for the first time now while I'm typing this. I have never seen your show before today. And as I see those people in your Base camp episode. I'm realizing I was only a half hour drive away from most of those incidents. We have a summer home in Blackduck MN. I was up there for my annual fishing trip, I live in Rockford IL. So I am very far away from where it happened right now. If you are looking for a sasquatch I suggest you head to the Lost Forty scientific natural area (SNA) in Northern Minnesota. I'm never going back there alone. Maybe for the right reasons if there were people with firearms with me. And I hope you guys please contact me by phone right away.This was only a few days ago so every detail is fresh in my mind still.",Within the marked trails in the Lost Forty scientific research area.

"I was driving on my way to school at 6:30am.  I'd just left my house and was only about 2 miles from home.  To my right was a large pig farm, and about a quarter mile ahead and on my left, was just a small farm.  I wasn't even driving the speed limit because the road was very icy.  I'd just come up to the driveway of the pig farm when I saw in my headlights what I initially thought to be a snowmobile pulling up out of the ditch right next to the mailbox.  It stopped and appeared that what I thought to be the operator of the snowmobile was standing and leaning down to reach the handlebars.  I instantly thought it was strange that they didn't have their headlights on.  At that moment, the figure bolted across the road.  The way I can describe it best is that it ran the way a young child would racing against friends.  The differences were, that the size made me believe that there was no way it was a child, it ran so fast and disappeared into the woods behind the house of the small farm and the amount of steps it took were so few that it couldn't have been any person that I knew.  I called my husband right away and asked about the owner of the home and if they were strange or different and if he would have any explanation as to why they would be out so early in the morning checking their mailbox.  I was trying to rationalize the situation.  He said that the owner of the property was ""normal"" as far as he  knew, but they had moved out months ago and nobody had been there since.  I wasn't able to make out too much detail as the sun hadn't quite come up over the horizon, but I could tell that it was tall and bulky with long arms and a very long stride.  This would explain why I thought the shadowed outline was a snowmobiler standing up and holding onto the handlebars.  An average person would appear taller, would look large in width because they most likely would have plenty of warm clothing and a helmet on and would appear to have longer arms down by their knees if they were reaching for the handlebars.

"Went camping at Lake Jeanette in the Superior National Forest in Minnesota. First night we were there we heard wood knocking. Knocked back and got three distinctive and separate responses. As we started to go to bed we heard a whooping noise. The next day we hiked out into the area which the sounds came from; no camps, nothing out there. After a long day of hiking and and swimming we went back to camp, ate dinner, and that night we started the knocks. Again we hear three responses. One of the three got closer and closer after each time we responded back. My friend got creeped out and we left the woods and sat at our camp site. As we are sitting by out fire we both saw a set of eyes staring at us. Neither one of us said anything about the eyes to the other until we were on our way home. We decided to go back into the woods for one last time and as we did something very close to us made a loud grunt.

"Went hunting south of Buhl about a half mile from the cemetery. In the wildlife refuge I made my way to a large swamp. Seeing nothing I headed back and jumped onto old railroad tracks. I heard something howling in a spruce swamp to the west of me. Every time I stopped it would get quiet. I started walking again and heading north when I noticed something on the road ahead of me about a half mile or so. It was black and at the distance I couldn't make out what it was. The closer I got I assumed it was a bear. But then it stood up and very quickly ran into the ditch and stood in the brush and looked at me. I couldn't believe what I had just saw.

"I was deer hunting about 5 miles from floodwood mn on co. rd 8 about a half mile after the blacktop ends just past the powerlines and before the gravel pit. I have hunted this state land for about 10 years with several friends and family over that time and knew everything about this area. On this Tuesday afternoon it was a very calm day almost no wind at all. You could hear every noise in the woods that day. There was not a deer in sight that day. I was going to wait till 5 or so and make my way out of the woods I had to walk through a couple thick cedar swamps on my way back to my car. At about 4:45 a branch snapped, then another. These were not small branches breaking and I could tell whatever it was was coming my way. I got my 308 ready to see what was coming towards me. I have been putting some bait out so I thought it might be a bear by how clumsily it was coming through the swamp. I then saw movement off my left side I got my gun up and tried to get the animal into my scope to identify what it's was. The color was dark brown like a moose and as I tried to get a good look at it through my scope. It stopped about 30 yards away and silence. I looked around my scope at it and I could not identify what it was. It was like a gorilla on two legs very thick and long hair. It must of saw me look around my scope. It was only there for a couple seconds and it let out a super loud howel. A howel like I have never heard anything make before. At that point it turned and went back the way it came from very rapidly. Covering ground through a thick swamp breaking branches as it went. I would estimate it went 100 yards in 10 seconds and then it stopped and howled once again very loud and it started moving again. I could tell it was going away from me to the south west rapidly. My heart was pounding through my chest. I climbed out of my stand and ran to my car about a mile away through that cedar swamp with my safety off and to scared to look back. I got to my car jumped in and tried to explain in my head what just happened.

I saw very clearly the creatures back and right side of body. I saw grey to brown long hair. Kind of like the coloring of a grey squirrel. The hair was wire like. It was about 2 truck lengths from my van. I laughed and told my husband and my kids I think I just saw Bigfoot haha. I told my husband what I saw stating it must be someone in a suit because I saw it clear as I would look and see a rabbit or a wolf crossing the road.

"On Saturday, October 21, 2006 my brother-in-law and I were bowhunting for deer in Alcona County in an area that we had been hunting for several years when we heard a sound that neither of us can explain. I was sitting in my tree stand facing basically south with my back to a dense cedar area with a small creek and a mixed hardwood forest in front of me.  My brother-in-law was hunting in a similar situation approximately 200 yards to my east.  The time was around 5:45 in the evening and the weather was clear and relatively warm perhaps in the upper 50s – low 60s.  At this time I had a small 4-point deer come walking down a deer run from the east toward me and stop approximately 40 yards away, standing there sniffing the air around it.  The light breeze was out of the north/northeast with the deer definitely upwind of me.  The deer stood there for about a minute or two mostly looking to the north and east, then turned directly south and walked away.  Shortly after this moment I heard a screaming sound coming from the east.  The sound had a human quality to it and sounded more angry than distressed.  I immediately thought my brother-in-law was hollering for some reason as he was in that direction but chose not to contact him via radio.  There were several short 10 second screams lasting a little over a minute and then stopped.  I sat there completely perplexed having never heard a sound like that before.  After this I noticed the conspicuous absence of any sound or movement in the forest.  Prior to this the woods had been filled with the sound of twittering birds and chattering squirrels.  After this, the forest was dead quiet.  This was the most eerie part of the whole event.  After the sun went down and I met my brother-in-law on our way back to camp he asked me what I had been doing to make that strange sound.  To him, the sound came from the west where I was sitting.  For me the sound was coming from the east where he was sitting so whatever the sound was it originated between us.  At this point neither of us had any idea of what could have made that sound.  We continued to hunt for the rest of the weekend without any more incidents or anything else unusual occurring. I had forgotten all about this when one day the following April I was watching an old episode of the television series “In Search Of” that was about the search for Bigfoot.  During this episode they talked about a particular bigfoot researcher.   For fun I went on the internet to see if this researcher was still around as this episode was 20 years old at least.  This is when I found the BFRO website and looked for sightings in Michigan.  When I found the report of the hunters being harassed in the fall of 1985 in the same area we had been in it all came rushing back to me.  Since then I found and downloaded a sound file from another website of a vocalization recording in Klamath, California.  I sent this to my brother–in-law and he agreed that this was very similar to what we had heard although what we had heard was deeper in pitch. I have thought about submitting this report a number of times since then but for whatever reason haven’t.  Now that deer season is quickly approaching I have been thinking about the incident more.  I still don’t know what it was that we heard but it certainly wasn’t anything I have ever heard before or after.  It was eerie at first returning to the location with this new found thought in my head but in the years since I have not had any additional experiences although I would like to get another chance to prove to myself that it wasn’t all a dream.",Approximately 1 mile west of Stout Road and 1/2 mile south of M-72,Alcona County,Michigan,Fall,44.62,-83.62335,5/19/11,26617,Class B,60.84,54.235,47.63,0.58,Rain in the morning.

And in the upper left hand corner of my yard about 25 yards away from my deer lick I saw a big figure about 7' maybe 8' tall. I was thinking it was a poacher in the yard killing deer. So I turned my brights on and started walking toward the figure. As I was walking I started to smell kinda like a smell of body odor and mildew smell and I was scared when I realized it wasn't a hunter. It took off down a game trail in the brush. I also need to say I'm not hunting off the lick, and the deer run when I pull up. I wasn't walking over there with a group of deer.

And I am on the north side of Goose Creek Lake, Stone Horse Lane. Last night 04/13/2017 I had just turned off my generator for a peaceful night of nature while I sleep. As I laid in bed I noticed that all the crickets, birds, frogs all stopped sounding or making noise. After about 20 or so minutes I heard what sounded like tree knocks but it was just one knock and I did not hear a reply. The direction in which I heard this sound was right next door on another lot beside mine. I thought to myself was that just what I thought it was a tree knock. I became frightened and I could hear my neighbors shed creak like something big pushed against it. I heard this for several minutes then it went silent again and still no sounds of any birds, crickets etc. The only reason I know it was a tree knock is because I've studied bigfoot since I was a kid, watching stories etc. Then I started hearing russling sounds coming from next door on same side I heard the knock come from. I could hear something pressing against the gravel driveway they have over there. At one time I thought I heard a growl and chewing sounds. After a terrifying hour or so I could hear what ever it was walking but it did not sound like a person, a animal walking. After a few minutes I heard a whooping sound but I did not hear a reply to it. I would appreciate it if someone can call me maybe come out here because today I went looking for signs of what it could have been and found a foot print in the gravel road just feet from where I heard all the noise the night before. I also took it upon myself and took pictures of the print with a tape measure. I then called security about the matter and they came out and I showed Randy the foot print. It measured 17"" by 6"" I am concerned that I may be in danger.",right next door to my camp lot,St. Francois County,Missouri,Spring,37.5965,-90.4935,4/13/17,57305,Class B,81.76,71.03,60.3,0.58,Mostly cloudy in the afternoon.
"I was driving to work on Hwy 248 north of Branson MO traveling south on the road.  I came around a corner and was a good distance from the vehicle in front of me, approx 200 yards or so. And a Bigfoot crossed the road between us.  It was early morning so it was still dark and I saw it in the headlights of my jeep.  It crossed the road from left to right in front of me in maybe three or four steps.  It was taller than the truck that was in front of me, later as I caught up to the truck I found out t was a full size Chevy 1500.  The Bigfoot was upright on two legs and was brownish, grayish in color.  It disappeared off the right side of the road up a hill into the brush.",Take hwy 248 north out of Branson approx 3-4 miles,Taney County,Missouri,Fall,36.39835,-93.14626,10/15/13,40177,Class A,65.48,55.225,44.97,0.39,Rain in the morning and overnight.
"Dual track line - MANY photos taken and measured - immediately after heavy 6"" snowfall on the night of Monday 15 Jan 2018. The night of Monday 15 Jan 2018, was dark - the night of the new (dark) moon. The overnight low temperature was -1° F, and the wind chill was -7° F, and there were six (6) inches of snow on the ground. At around midnight… we heard a “THUMP” outside our bedroom window. Just beneath our window is a large plastic storage box for BBQ charcoal. The BBQ grill (covered with a winter tarp) is approximately 8 feet from the storage box, with an area between for use by summer grill masters. The “THUMP” was the sound of something striking the side of that large plastic storage box - a sound we’d heard numerous times in the past when working around the box and accidentally bumping or kicking it. Despite the sound being a very familiar one, and one which we instantly recognized, it was “out of place” for the middle of the night and both Sharon and I awoke instantly. I said aloud “DID YOU HEAR THAT?” Sharon answered “YES I DID!” I felt the bed tremble several times very slightly… similar to when a heavy truck drives by on the road out front… and I said aloud “I HEAR FOOTSTEPS!” At that point I considered grabbing my handgun to deal with a potential intruder, but the sounds and the vibrations were not repeated. We listened for a few more minutes then went back to sleep. The next day, Tuesday 16 Jan 2018, the temperature never climbed over 12° F, with light winds, but a wind chill that remained at-or-below 0° F. We stayed inside nearly all day, only venturing out on the east side of the house briefly to check temperatures in our out-buildings. Mid-afternoon Sharon asked me if I’d been outside in the yard. I told her that I had not gone out at all except to check the well house earlier. She stood at the bedroom window and pointed to a line of large, widely spaced footprints outside… and said that it appeared that we HAD been visited by an “intruder” during the night. We went out to find TWO lines of tracks coming toward the house from the west, then curving south alongside the house just outside the bedroom window. One of the line of tracks was footprints that were 13”-14” long, 5” wide at the heel, and 7” wide at the toe. Some of those tracks clearly showed individual toe prints. All were smooth, with no pattern or marking and no break between heel and the remainder of the foot (as would be found with a boot or shoe). One of the line of tracks appeared to be smaller footsteps - presumable a juvenile - with clear toe prints showing in some of the footprints. At times the juvenile tracks showed dragging toes side-by-side as if the walker was partially lifted upward so that both feet dragged marks in the snow, side-by-side, before resuming walking. At other points the smaller juvenile prints appeared to indicate that the walker had hopped repeatedly two or three times on one foot, then “jumped” or been lifted, dragging both feet for a distance of some 8 feet, and then planting one foot and resuming stride, or hopping onto the other foot. We believe that one of those hops or jumps resulted in the juvenile bumping the storage box which woke us inside the bedroom, and prompted out vocal comments. Those comments would have been very clearly audible just outside the window. Beside the plastic storage box located beneath our bedroom window the two lines of tracks became a single track (apparently the juvenile was lifted by the larger adult). The stride length of the larger prints averaged 5 1/2 feet as the tracks approached the house. Both lines curved, turning south close beside the house (this is the point at which the juvenile prints appear to show lifting, dragging both feet, and hopping). At the point where the two lines of tracks changed to a single line of large (adult) footprints - presumably due to the adult having heard our vocal comments inside the bedroom, and reacted by lifting/carrying the juvenile. At that point the stride length of the larger prints grew to 6 feet in length, at some points nearing 7 feet apart. There is no indication of running at any point in the larger print tracks, either before or after the closest approach to the bedroom window and the plastic storage box. There were no toe scuffing or heel scuffing as are made by a human attempting to run in the snow. There were “brush” marks behind several of the large (adult) footprints. Close examination of those mark revealed they looked like they were made with a whisk broom with a very light touch. Individual traces could be seen clearly… and it is presumed that the marks were made by dragging hairs that hung from the legs of the creature that made the tracks. The line of large prints made a line heading directly for the roadway - obviously quickly moving away from the house and our voices inside the bedroom. The tracks crossed the road (and were later obliterated in the roadway by multiple visits from the snowplow on Tuesday), continuing at an angle across the yard on the other side. Approximately 100 feet into that other yard, the stride length of the large print tracks slightly reduced, and the smaller (juvenile) prints reappeared. We presume that that larger creature (adult) put the smaller (juvenile) back on the ground. The two lines of tracks continued in a straight line another 300 feet toward a dense treeline. I contacted RON BOLES with the Bigfoot Field Research Organization (BFRO) who had been involved in investigating the traces of activities we have had on our property for many years. While he was unable to visit in person, he arranged for another BFRO Investigator to stop by on the morning of Wednesday at 8am to photograph the prints. Sadly many of the prints in our yard were slightly degraded by wind-blown snow dropping from overhanging trees that eroded the sharper edges of the prints. The track of prints in the neighbor’s yard across the road was not degraded due to an absence of overhanging trees to shed snow. Temperatures later on the day Wednesday, then on Thursday, melted enough snow to remove all but a single handful of prints in the deepest snow in the neighbor’s yard. Those prints, however, were degraded by tracks from stray dogs which appeared to find extreme interest in the line of strange tracks. By Friday virtually all snow had melted and no evidence of the tracks remained.","Entry for TANEY COUNTY, MISSOURI dated 1998 is mine, about my property. It is only one of NUMEROUS incidents.

"Recently at about 4am I was traveling east out of Fort Scott, Kansas. Just over the Missouri border the road gets narrow with heavy forest almost coming up to the edge of it. Ahead of me at the end of my headlights I saw something run across the road on 2 legs. It was covered with thick brown hair and it had to be big because in just 2 or 3 steps it was across the road and gone into the forest on the other side. It wasn't a bear or a farm animal because they run on 4 legs. And it wasn't a man either unless he had never had a shave or a haircut in his life. A man might be able to run fast, but he couldn't possibly have a stride long enough to come out of a forest, cross a road, and disappear again into the forest on the other side in just a couple of seconds.

I would say it was 7.5'-8' tall and 350-400 pounds.  I'm not sure of the color since it was dark. I would say it was dark brown, but the moonlight and limited visibility gave it's coat a whiteish sheen. The vehicle I was driving was a 'lifted' pickup truck.  I was able to see eye-to-eye with it. The creature appeared to be much taller than the vehicle, but it was either squatting slightly or hunched down a bit. It had very broad shoulders, much larger than anything I had ever seen.

"Highway 7 South, Richland, MO 2158 September 4, 2012 My daughter who had come to visit me was getting ready to leave.  We were taking a last minute look at my garden which is very close to the house.  We had only been out there a couple of minutes and then we heard the most unusual screaming sound.  My daughter asks if it was a coyote and I said NO and ushered her back to the house.  The call came less than 150 feet from the house.  It was loud and remarkable.  The dog that usually barks and runs after everything ran under the house. I did not say what I thought it was to her; instead we looked on the internet for sounds that might occur, like coyotes, panthers, fox, Barn owls, etc. After going through the whole directory.  She asks what the sound was.  We then listened to recorded sounds from Big Foot recordings.  Our stomachs turned. Yes, that is exactly what it sounded like.  I have lived in the country most of my life.  I grew up listening to coyotes and the occasional panther, bobcats, owls, Ferrell dogs and deer they all can make weird sounds.  But this, this is crazy.  I never thought that I would hear something like that in my woods.  I live in the river bottoms and I remember when I was young we heard the same sound, that was over thirty years ago. When I thought back on what happened, I realized that before we left the house my inside dog and cat were acting strange, pacing and panting. When we exited the house to go to the garden I should have known something was not quite right.  There were no night time sounds.. No crickets or frogs .. Just silence.. I finally put on my brave face and escorted my daughter to her car and pretended like everything is ok.  I could still hear snaps and cracks in the woods.  I watched her drive off then quickly got back in the house.  In the morning......I'll go look for other evidence, for now you couldn't pay me to go outside and I don't spook easy at all!

"Hi, I am a Corporal police officer in central Missouri. I have had two accounts with bigfoots. First I was night fishing with my uncle when a large hairy thing came down a huge bluff making tons of noise I hit it with a spotlight across the river. The figure was crouched down on the bank looking and rocking side to side. I could not make out a face though. I shut the light off asked my uncle ""what is that?"" he didn't reply. I heard a second one coming down the bluff crashing and bashing. I hit the light again, I couldn't see the other one at that time. I heard a splash as the first bigfoot jumped in water 5 or 6 foot deep and the water was about the bottom of the rib cage. I turned to my uncle who took off running as I followed not looking back. In 2014 My wife and I went hiking as we were hiking I heard a cow growl across the road across 3 fences. I told my wife I have heard it before. I grew up in the country I have hunted all my life I am not scared of any human or animal till these encounters with bigfoot. The growl came across the county road and along the bluff bottom as we walked it traveled over two hundred yards within two min's. It growled again so close my hair stood on end I told my wife get behind me after hearing the growl I pulled my glock 40 ready to fire. I was shaking not with fear with what I heard and could not see. I stood there over ten min's gun ready and never seen or heard the growl again. Now google a cow growling and intense that 5 fold. I know the difference of a bear or a wild pig I have hunted them both I have never seen or heard things like these before. the first property is public the second is private and the third place I will not go into.

"I am a Soldier stationed at Fort Leonardwood, MO.  Every morning we do physical exercises such as running.  That morning we did a 3.8 mile run on the ""Engineer Trail"".  The Engineer trail is a giant 3.8 mile track that has about 10 acres of land in the middle of the circle for land navigation exercises, and towards the back of the track opens up into a giant forest that feeds into Misty Mountain and the outer section of the post.  That land behind the track is 100+ acres I'd say.  On the morning of 1 October, 2014 around 0600- 0615, we (about 15 Soldiers) started our run individually, so we were spread out being some were faster than others.  About midway through the track, we came across a barrier.  A tree about 3-4 feet in diameter that looked to be healthy, not rotten, and relatively in good shape was laid across the track.  We haven't had any crazy wind storms that could've knocked it over, but at any rate myself and other soldiers didn't think anything of it.  As i continued on my run, I encountered another tree that was knocked over but it looked as if someone, maybe some soldiers, had drug it off the road.  Same diameter as the other one, but almost as if someone didn't want us on the track.  I continued on my run and about a mile and half I reached the the back side of the track where it meets the woods that go towards the eastern side of the border of post.  That's when I started hearing a yell that kind of sounded like ""whoops"".  It must've been around 200 feet away.  I immediately stopped running and started listening.  That's when I heard around 5 different ""whoops"".  I say around 5 because each time I heard it, I had to change the position of my head each time I heard one.  3 were from inside the circle of the track, and about 2-4 were on the border of track on the backside.  Being that I was out there alone, (I was in the lead of the pack of Soldiers) I didn't want to encounter what I was hearing I started running to get away from the back side of the track and back towards the civilization side with a quickness.  I know what I heard immediately being that I google, youtube, and watch a lot of documentaries on bigfoot.  The thing was when I got back to the start point, I didn't want to mention what I had heard in fear I might be made fun of or something.  So when the rest of the group caught up and finished.  They immediately started talking about the sounds.  A few of them even mentioned ""bigfoot calls"", with a seriousness.  Most people when they talk about bigfoot, you always get the guys who are sarcastic and snobby.  Well this group of Soldiers we all agreed, there was a family of them out there talking to each other out there on the track. On top of that, I have encountered this odor before when me and my wife will go ride trails on the 4 wheeler, a musky odor.  The entire run, all I could describe the odor as is like a musky/ sewage smell the entire route.  We have ran that route several times, and normally all you smell are the trees and weeds around.

"First off I would like to say that I am not one to normally see much of anything, I am a believer in the possibility of many things but rarely see them.  In this instance, again I didn't so much see anything as hear it. The first incident took place in the middle of November of 2012.  It was in a rural area of Missouri outside the city of Rayville.  The area is a mix of farm and woodland.  It was approximately 9pm when I drove to a friend's house.  As I was walking from my car to his door I noticed what sounded like someone or something big walking about 30 or 40 yards away from me in the woods. It was just beyond the range of what I could see into the woods. When I stopped walking it stopped walking and when I started to walk it began again.  It was only about a 40 foot walk to the door and I walked slowly as I tried to figure this out.  About half way I stopped to think and it stopped once more.  From what I heard it was a sound of only 2 feet walking and was large.  It didn't sound at all like a 4 foot creature like a deer.  I went in to tell my friend but when we came out there was no sound.  About a week later I came out again and was walking to the door and jokingly called out ""are you there bigfoot?"" and laughed to myself. As I approached the door something flew out of the woods and hit my friends car.  Later in the evening when I left, in the distance I heard dogs going crazy and the sound of something large screaming.  It has been several weeks since I last heard anything but my friend says he too has heard the sound of something walking in the woods.  I have thought about if it was a person possibly playing a joke but no one knew I was going there.  Thought about it being another animal but it sounded too big to be a deer.  It has me extremely curious so I would love some feedback and your thoughts.  As I say I am not one quick to jump to conclusions and tend to be the first to look for other causes to things.","This happened near Rayville, Mo.

On 10-11-2015 at approximately 10 pm I was driving around and thought I would stargaze at the old conservation fire tower on 21 highway near the old 21 drive-in. I parked my truck by the picnic table. I turned off my truck and got out looking at the stars. It was just a moment and I noticed a whooping call it sounded like a monkey at the zoo. I listened for a good 20 minutes the call was the same a whoop whoop then a pause for a short time then another whoop whoop.

"It was a humid Spring night (9ish) & I was headed home from a trip to town to take movies back & pick up a few things for the house. I was rounding the last curb before my driveway when my headlights caught a figure starting to cross the road. I had to stop on the hwy so I wouldn't hit it so I got a good look at what was crossing the road but didn't realize what I was seeing and everything happened so fast.

"In the years of 2015-16 I had encounters with a creature in the Mississippi River bottoms at a place called Drinkwater, a flood control pump station on the Mississippi levee system east of Charleston, Missouri. The first encounter consisted of hearing high pitched, long drawn out echoing of the concrete walls of the pump station. The sounds were from far off so I paid them no mind at the time but I did find them to be quite odd. The second encounter happen a few months later as a few friends and I were bowfishing one night. We were down by the lock gate shooting fish when I happened to look up on the levee to our right and noticed something standing on the levee watching us about 200 or so yards off. Even though it was dark, you could see the outline of the figure standing upright in the faint light caused by a semi truck weigh station on the highway that crossed over to Cairo, Illinois. It didn’t stay long but it left an eerie feeling over us at the time, we left shortly afterwards. The third encounter was the most interesting one of all. One of my friends and I were bowfishing again one night at the pump station when we began hearing the high pitched sounds again. My friend, who was holding a spotlight so that I could see to shoot began to go into a panic and started shining the light in the woods to our right which irritated me at the time because I couldn’t see the fish without the light. While trying to calm him down to get the light back to the water something grunted off to our left. At 25 yards or so stood a creature of a height between 8’ and 9’ foot tall covered in dark brown to black hair at the very edge of the tree line in full view of the spotlight. The creature watched us for a little under a minute time with one arm gripping a tree limb the size of my forearm as if he were using it to keep his balance. When the creature departed he let out several loud grunts and at a steady walking pace left the scene while breaking any tree limb in it path, whether it was dead or green. We left after the encounter terrified and what we had just witnessed.",The location is a the very end of county highway J. The highway ends at the levee.

"I was letting my dogs out to go to the bathroom before I left for work. It was 3:30A.M. I drive an hour to work and get there by 5 so that’s why I was up so early. All was quite and peaceful. Heard a owl off in a tree line. Then about 5 minutes later I heard off in the distance something I had never heard before. I hear coyotes all the time. I’ve heard a bobcat screaming before, but this was far different. It sounded like it was quite always off whatever it was, but sounded very big and deep. The only way I can think to explain the noise was like a big burley man yelling AWWWWWWWW for about 5-10 seconds long. Then nothing else. It caused a neighbor dog down the road to start barking but didn’t seem to phase my dogs. The direction that the noise came from is about 2-3 miles of a combination of timber and farm land, then becomes a big river bottoms and the grand river. I don’t think whatever made the noise was 2-3 miles away, maybe a mile. I have never heard anything like that before in my life and I’ve been a outdoors guy my whole life. I’ve watched different Bigfoot shows hear vocalizations on them and that’s the closest thing I can think of that this sounded like. However I feel like recorded things on TV doesn’t give you the same feel of the power this thing seemed to have, it sent chills down my spine.

"Hello BFRO I have something I would like to share with you I believe I have see what people and myself call bigfoot . The first time was on a night time coon hunt. I hunt coons with traps and dogs yet I don't kill them. I let my dogs tree them and I go on to another track with my dog . I had hunted this bottom a night before and my dog was hot on a track deep in the woods bawlen the whole track when he shut up and not a sound from him for twenty minutes. Then all the sudden he came up the creek with his tail between his legs looking back and came straight to me. Ok first this is a hound who has never ran anything but coons and has never stopped tracking with out treeing, anyway, so I thought maybe he got spooked by a bobcat or something so I loaded him up and went home not thinking anything about it. The next evening on the 12th I pulled into the same open field in a bottom where two creeks join. I shined my lights of my truck along the trees of the creeks to see if I could spot some coon and low and behold I saw what I believe was a bigfoot in my head lights at about 75 yards was a enormous blackish brown figure was walking toward the trees through the field to the creek it stopped for a brief moment and just stared at me like it was looking right at me and took large lengthy steps into the woods. I was startled and not only was I startled but my hound in my back seat was startled as well whining and whimpering. I know what me and my hound saw and my dog hasn't ever backed down from an animal as long as I've had it and I've spent countless of hours in the timber with him. [The following was taken from this witness' second BFRO report, after returning to the site :] After talking to the BFRO rep I decided I would go back to the location I had my sighting on the12th, and sat in the exact place I was. Tonight when I got there, there was tracks crossing the road from the north to the south and they were wet and large foot prints. Its 18 degrees here, clearly not a humans tracks. There were 5 prints, one in front of the other, which was rather weird and I do have the pictures of them but their really hard to make out . It was awesome, I got some wood knock responses that were really close across the highway from me, the directions the prints were. I  shined the area and yet I never seen anything. I know what I heard. I'm going to keep squatching the area and a few others to hopefully get a picture of the squatch I saw on the 12th. I consider myself a very very good hunter and I am going to put some of my game cams in the area as well as camo up and sit in the area. I was rather timid tonight on the phone with the BFRO, due to the way people feel about it around here, but I know what I saw and heard.",,Jackson County,Missouri,Winter,39.03445,-94.10855,2/12/13,39835,Class B,41.31,35.39,29.47,0.09,Mostly cloudy in the evening.
"While birding the James Reed Wildlife area in Lee's Summit Missouri in the late afternoon of March 8, 2013, I observed in the tree line on the west side of of Bodarc Lake a large brown hairy creature walking along the edge of the Lake.

"I was taking pictures in the James A. Reed Wildlife Area just outside of Lee’s Summit Missouri yesterday, specifically around Bodarc Lake. I was intrigued since the wildlife area is fairly close to where I live. I decided to take some pictures. I crossed the dam over to the south side of the lake where I encountered two men fishing. I spoke briefly to one of the fisherman about the fish he’d caught that afternoon and the weather which was rather threatening. I wished him luck and headed west along the tree line when I encountered the other man. I spoke, but he seemed preoccupied so I walked on. I turned toward the tree line and started taking pictures into the woods after about the fourth picture I heard what I can only describe as a kind of a grunting snorting sound followed by a low but deep growl it was unlike anything I’d ever heard before. It sounded so close, but I didn’t see anything in the woods. I was petrified I turned and headed back towards the two men. I asked them if they’d heard anything one of the men was a little hesitant and really didn’t answer me the other man said yes it was probably a cougar. I told them to be careful and left just before I crossed the dam I stopped to take a picture of a large footprint in the mud. Already shaken by the experience and definitely inexperienced I failed to lie something down beside the footprint to gauge the size of it. But to be honest the only thing I wanted to do was put as much distance between me and those woods as possible. I crossed the dam to my car it was then I heard the same sound coming from across the lake in the vicinity of where I had been. It was muffled because of the distance, but still surprisingly loud that same grunting snorting growl.  The fisherman must have heard it as well because they were coming across the dam at a fairly fast pace. We didn’t speak again they got into their truck, me into my car and we left.",The incident took place in the James A.

"On the 7th of June 2013 a friend of mine and I decided to visit the Monkey Mountain Nature Reserve in Grain Valley as she believed  we might catch sight of a  Sasquatch, since there had been documented sightings  in that area and she knew that I was very interested in the Sasquatch legend. As we traveled down E RD Mize Road towards the parking lot area, we were startled when a large creature on all fours crossed the road less than a hundred feet in front of us.  My friend stopped the car and we watched it cross the road from North to South.  It appeared it had come from a field to the right of us. It was covered in dark hair and very muscular. The back was arched and its head was tucked. I didn’t see a tail of any kind. I did however, notice the hair on its back was considerably shorter than it was on the rest of its body. It seemed to just glide across the road which I though was strange since it was very large. I’m guessing it weighed at least five hundred pounds or more. I reached for my camera which was in my lap but the creature had already disappeared. We continued down the road and reached the parking lot where I asked my friend to go back so that we could look for prints, but she refused. I told her I thought we’d just seen a Sasquatch and she told me it must have been a large dog possibly a Newfoundland because they are large black dogs.  I told her that we had a better chance of seeing a Sasquatch in that particular area than a Newfoundland. It was then she told me that she was going to keep quiet about what we had seen and that I should do the same, which obviously I didn’t do. I know what I saw and it wasn’t a dog, a deer or anything I had ever seen before.","Monkey Mountain is an 855 acre nature preserve in Eastern Jackson County, halfway in-between Grain Valley and Oak Grove.",Jackson County,Missouri,Spring,38.5992,-94.1057,6/7/13,41395,Class A,73.26,62.625,51.99,0.97,Partly cloudy until evening.

"Several times a week I go fishing at the James Reed Memorial Wildlife Area just south of Lee's Summit, MO. It's about 900 acres plus 10 lakes to choose from for fishing and a area with walking trails. Each lake has a level, mowed area about 20 feet wide all the way round it. It is wooded and brushy between lakes plus there are also open meadow/fields scattered around. Animal life is deer (lots of them), fox, possums, rabbit, racoon, squirrel, turkey, geese, golden eagles, cranes, vultures and many smaller birds. During the week there aren't many people there fishing so sometimes I'm the only one. I prefer fishing at the lake that is farthest from the main entrance. I think Google Maps shows it as #9 but it has a name. The first week of August, 2020, I was there fishing for bass and had worked my way half way around the lake when I came upon a very large pile of scat in the mowed walking area. It was well formed and shaped like human feces.  I estimated its size as 16 X 14 inches and about 5 inches high. My first thought was an obese person had somehow managed to completely empty their guts. There are horse riders allowed in the area but I've never once seen their hoofprints around the lake in that area not any horse scat.  The pile did not resemble in any way what a horse does. The last week of August, 2020, I was the only person there and there were no other cars in the parking lot.  I was near where I'd seen the scat.  When I fish I move slowly and quietly. I was on the southwest side of the lake when I heard what I thought was a hoot owl. It hooted three times with no space between hoots. I've never hear an owl do that. I walked and fished for another 100 feet or so and was facing the water when in the trees/brush behind me I heard a deep HumphGrrrr sound. Both sounds were ran together and I could feel it vibrate in my chest. I immediately turned completely around thinking that there was a huge dog nearby and I wanted to make sure it wasn't sneaking up on me. The sound lasted about 3 seconds and even after I couldn't hear it I still felt it vibrate in my chest for a few more seconds. I looked as far back into the trees/brush as I could and saw nothing. I wasn't scared but I felt that I needed to leave so I left and went home. I was there fishing on Sept 8 or 9, 2020 (can't remember which day this happened). Same lake, same time, about 11 AM. I was on the northwest side of the lake casting for bass and I was the only one there. Earlier there was a young man fishing but he left about 10 AM. Except for the occasional bird and locust it was quiet. Suddenly in the brush behind me I heard what I can only describe as a small chimp making sounds like Cheetah the Chimp. I would guess the source of it to be closer than 50 feet. I heard it for perhaps a second or two then it stopped suddenly like someone had flipped a switch. I turned completely around and looked as far back into the trees/brush as I could. I even looked up into the trees on both sides of me and saw nothing. I moved a little faster and quickly worked my way around the lake to the parking lot then went home. That was as weird as the owl and growl I'd heard.

"As I was traveling South Bound on US 33 approximately 5 miles from US 116 near Plattsburg MO on Friday July 11th 2014 at 11:48 pm, I witnessed a sizable creature cross the roadway from West to East jump the fence in pass into the corn. I was nearing the rounding of a sharp curve in the road which features a gully that empties into a creek, that then empties into an outer portion of the Little Platte River. The area is a mixture of farmland, which is primarily corn or soybean ground, some cow pastures and a mixture of  trees, gully's, and waterways which flow into the river. As I entered the curve my eyes caught a a large shadow as it crossed the road 50 yards in front of me. My initial reaction to this was oh a deer, there are probably more so I hit the brakes a slowed slightly. In the time it took me to blink my eyes and reopen them the shadow had passed completely across the roadway and was at the edge of the ditch, as the distance between us closed and more of the light from the headlights illuminated the shadow. I was able to get a better view of what I was dealing with. What I had thought was a deer was in fact much larger, and upright. As the light caught the side of the creature it made an extremely agile motion which consisted of two steps from the edge of the ditch to the fence line. In the same motion the creature placed its left hand on the top wire of the fence, jumped and cleared the fence with both feet and disappeared into the corn. Description: Height: 7' to 7 1/2' it was very tall Width: Unknown, my view was a complete side profile view Depth: 24""-30"" easy maybe more Hair: shaggy light red/brown. The hair length on the body, at least the portions I was able to see varied, some portions were longer others shorter. Reminds me of how the hair is on my Golden Retriever in a way. The creature was very stout and the weight had to have been 350-400 lbs. possibly more. I did not get a view of the creature's head or face at all, the face was a complete shadow the entire time and even with the light from the headlights there was no eye glow. The feet and legs were all but blocked from view as well either from the lack of light or from the vegetation once it was in the ditch. The portion I got the best view of was the left arm as it braced the top wire of the fence and made its jump over.  The arm was very large and hair covered, the hair appeared to be longer above the elbow than it was below, with the hair on the hand being the shortest.",I could provide the approximate location again but there are no real distinguishing landmarks which make this area of the roadway stand out from the rest of the surroundings.,Clinton County,Missouri,Summer,39.60238,-94.40015,7/11/14,45851,Class A,88.94,82.6,76.26,0.47,Mostly cloudy until afternoon and humid throughout the day.
"Myself and 3 friends went to a game access area close to Smithville Lake where myself and several other young men had witnessed a pair of red eyes looking at us in October or November of 2011. Myself and the 3 friends went back to the game access in May of 2012 late at night, close to 11 or 12. We walked around for a little while and didn't hear anything so we went back to the jeep and waiting with the windows cracked. We stayed there quietly chatting for around an hour or an hour and a half, then we felt a strange feeling and decided to leave. The driver turned the car on and the passenger pointed and screamed. Off the front of the car about 30 yards was a large figure squatted down looking at us with red eyes. The driver attempted to turn around and almost hit the creature in his frenzy of getting turned around. Myself and the passenger, as i was sitting behind the passenger, got within 7 or 8 feet of the creature through the window. The face still haunts me to this day and I have trouble writing about it these 6 years on. It was much more human like than I ever would have guessed. Simply horrifying and still gives me nightmares. It all happened in a span of 10 - 15 seconds by the time the driver got us out of there.

"I was going to Settle's Ford conservation area with my girlfriend to look at the stars. We pulled up to a gravel parking lot with fields to the east and a tree line to the west. My girlfriend and I felt uneasy for some reason when we got out of the car, but it had only been our second time there and we didn't bring her dog this time around. I have a pretty powerful little spotlight flashlight with a zoom lens to really get a distant read on eye shine. I decided to do a quick look around with it and almost out it down when I thought i saw something out of place in the field. I don't know why it caught my attention, as I had just skimmed over it with my flashlight before bringing it back around to decipher whether or not I was looking at an animal or a tree. But I noticed it was a little more... white? I shined the light on this thing for no more than 3 seconds before it started moving west. This was 50 yards away, but the first thought that came to my mind was it was a man, and told my girlfriend to immediately get in the car. Once I jumped in I realized that it is nearly 1 am, there are no cars here, and nobody would be in a field dressed in white at the hours. It just doesn't make sense. I then pulled my car around back to the road in it's direction to try and take a closer look, but only 40 feet or so down the gravel road, the fog started to get heavy. Feeling incredibly creeped out, me and my girlfriend high tailed it back home. From the distance in the fog, I could tell it was white, upright, somewhat slender and VERY tall. The head was distinct from the rest of the body and it seemed to move at a little more than casual pace once it realized I could see it standing there. I know this was not a deer because I would see the rest of it's body and I know it wasn't another person because a singular person would be out of there mind to walk out into a field to hang out in the middle of the night. Plus it was way too tall.  I will not be going back to this area.","Cass county side of Settles Ford on the north side of the river, 2nd parking lot coming into the conservation area before reaching the river",Cass County,Missouri,Summer,38.46156,-94.14297,7/23/20,65808,Class A,92.43,82.08,71.73,0.12,Humid throughout the day.

"Two friends and myself were driving back roads in our home town out of boredom in the evening. We stopped at a small conservation area known as Riverside off a dirt road that shares the same name. There is a boat ramp off the Meremac River and a picnic table about 50 yards off the road and obstructed by woods and brush. There are trash barrels at the location and fishermen empty their coolers and discard fishing waste when they take their boats out of the water. There are farms and residences in the area, but nothing for about half a mile due to the area's proclivity to flood. There have also been incidents of violence in this location in the past (person on person) so there's a local aversion to the area, which makes it particularly absent of people at night. The three of us were talking and walking down the boat ramp to the edge of the river (the trees and brush make the ramp the only place that the river is visible in this area). There is a small gravel bar/island that is heavily wooded about 200 feet from the edge of the boat ramp where the river forks and splits. There was a decent amount of moon light and we were watching the water. We heard some noise in the brush on the island or maybe the opposite bank. A few moments passed and what sounded likes a rock hit the bank on our side (maybe fifteen or twenty feet down river) followed by what sounded like another rock landing in the river (presumably in the same vicinity of the first rock). We froze for maybe ten seconds, then we heard what we all collectively determined to sound like an ape yowling from about the same direction of the noises and rocks. I would say the sound was more like a one tone, moderately deep exhale or grunt that had a shrill undertone that gave it an aggressive feeling. We left immediately. We've all lived in rural areas for most of our lives and know the sounds of local wildlife. This sound wasn't one any of us had encountered before. We never saw anything.",Conservation area,Crawford County,Missouri,Summer,37.99225,-91.42575,6/1/10,50717,Class B,88.13,77.78,67.43,0.65,Partly cloudy in the afternoon.
"We bought our place 5 years ago on the Meremac River here in Franklin County Missouri. Things happen on a daily basis, like howls, tree knocks and something looming in our woods. Our son used to travel home late at night on his electric bike 2.5 miles from town to home here. He stopped traveling at night (3 am) after something 7 foot tall white and hairy crossed a field next to the road and was gone. It terrified him so much he moved into town permanently and will not live out here. Myself and my husband hear strange howl calls. I hear tree knocks on our back land, and smell a horrible wet dog smell sometimes coming off the hill. I do not trail walk our land anymore nor do I go out at dark. I have chickens disappear from a locked coop and 2 peacocks killed inside a locked 10 foot by 10 foot cage. The 200 acres down the road is where my son seen the one head towards. As a Minister I was hesitant to write this but feel something is out here and in a group. I believe a investigation should be done. My guard dog refuses to be out in the back land area as if frightened of something. I won't even swim in our pool alone. I feel watched and a few times seen something tall in the woods but could not get the nerve to get closer. As we have found deer legs and parts that should not have been killed as we do not hunt our forest animals. Today I heard tree knocks again when I stepped out to feed the barn cats. Nope. I came back in it creeps me out. I almost want to sell our place but it's so beautiful out here. The bluff off the back land is a 100 foot bluff above the Meremac River.

"At the time of this occurrence we had been at Clarkco State Park for two nights in a cabin. The previous morning, Wednesday, October 20, 2010, I had walked the length of the cabin road to its dead end, turned around, and then walked the length of the cabin road all the way across the dam to the park headquarters building.   During this time I shot photos of leaf colors, a duck on the water, and various other things.  Nothing unusual was seen or heard that morning (morning of Wednesday, October 20, 2010). The following morning (Thursday, October 21, 2010) I awoke around 730AM.  My wife was still asleep.    I had a bite to eat, put on my clothes, got my digital camera, and headed out on the road towards the dam of Clarkco Lake to get some early morning photos.  The time I left the cabin was about 815AM CDT. The temp was down around 45 degrees that morning and there was a light fog coming off the lake.  The morning was completely clear – brilliant sunshine - with no overcast and some light breezes now and then. I tried to sneak up on some turtles that were out on a log to shoot a photo, but they were too quick for me.   All of them slipped into the water.  I shot a few photos of the lake, leaf colors, and the fog from the south end of the dam (the end away from the park headquarters building). After shooting several photos I headed back to the cabin on the road that led away from the dam.   When I was about 150 feet from our cabin I heard a distinct knocking sound like you would get if you were hitting a 2x4 with another 2x4, or maybe hitting a 2x4 with a hammer.   I thought there might be some carpenters doing some work at a house located nearby.   However, we were inside the state park and I knew of no houses – other than the ranger houses - within the park.    This knocking sound continued on.   I didn't count the number of ""knocks,"" but I'd say they numbered at least ten knocks and were in a steady rhythm. I stopped walking and looked directly into the wooded, hilly area in the direction the sound seemed to be coming from (towards the south).   The knocking stopped when I stopped walking.   I saw nothing and heard nothing while I was stopped on the road.   There were no odors in the air at this time either.   As mentioned above, there was a light breeze blowing from time to time that morning.  I then proceeded to walk to our cabin which was only about another 75 feet away.   As I began to walk the knocking sound started again and this time I attempted to count the knocks.   There were five or six knocks in a steady rhythm.  Then there were no more. When I got into the driveway of the cabin I again looked in the direction that I thought the sounds came from and saw nothing. Could this sound have come from construction work between the state park and U.S. Highway 45?   Could there have been a utility company crew working in the woods on a power line? I have been in the woods for years as a Scout leader, a camper, and as a hunter, I have heard woodpeckers and other animals make noises before.   This was not a woodpecker.   It was not a deer hitting a tree with his rack.   This was a heavy and deliberate sound.  This knocking sound was unlike any animal sound I have ever encountered. There were no ""whoops,"" ""calls,"" or other noises, just the wood knocking sound.   The knocking was a ""hard"" sound almost like a carpenter hitting a piece of wood repeatedly with a hammer in a steady rhythm.   That's one of the reasons I lean towards it being a sound from a construction site.    However, the fact that the knocking stopped when I stopped walking and looked into the woods, and then resumed when I began walking again, makes me think there are other possibilities as to its origin. After coming home from the state park I listened to wood knocking sounds on the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization website.   The wood knocking sound I heard exactly matches the recorded wood knocking sounds on some of the bigfoot websites.  Again, the sound was similar to hitting two 2x4s together or pounding on a 2x4 with a hammer. During midmorning of that same day we left the state park and went to Meridian for a few hours.    My wife was not feeling well when we returned, so when we got back to the state park we packed our belongings in the car and headed for home.   We had paid for three nights at the park, but we only stayed two nights.  We left the park around 330PM CDT that day.   I didn't hear or see anything out of the ordinary the remainder of the time we were in the state park. The GPS coordinates where I was on the cabin road when I heard these knocking sounds are approximately: N  32 degrees, 5 minutes, 53 seconds     W  88 degrees, 41 minutes, 44 seconds.","Clarkco State Park is located just off US Highway 45 about four miles or so north of Quitman, MS.",Clarke County,Mississippi,Fall,32.09515,-88.68893,10/21/10,35789,Class B,82.36,62.06,41.76,0.45,Clear throughout the day.

It was about 6:30 am, just getting light. I was driving with my brother in law sitting beside me. About 30 yards in front of us a large being jumped out of the Missouri River onto the road. It was black and wet. My headlights reflected off of the fur. It jumped onto the road and jumped again up to the bluff. It was about 8 foot tall by the trees that were there by the river. We stopped and looked up the bluff to see or hear it moving but, nothing happened. The river level was high. I don't know what could swim in the torrents and drift wood rushing in it.

"Thursday, May 14th 2020. 10:30 am. South of Hartsburg MO. About 1500 hundred ft south of town on South Bush Landing Road. Hartsburg is a small community of around 100 people. The area is on the bottoms of the Missouri River. A bike trail called ""Katy Trail"" runs North and South through Hartsburg. My wife was taking care of her 93 year old mother and I decided to drive down to the river and look around. There were a lot of people riding bikes on the trail because of the pandemic going strong and no one could work or shop. It was a sunny warm day. I was driving south slowly when I looked up ahead on the road and I saw a big figure moving across the road in a very fast pace. Not running but, walking in big fast strides. It looked like vert big person, tall, thick, and brown in color all over. I thought it was weird for a guy to be walking across a farmers field coming east from the river and heading in a straight line to the bluffs. Farmers will ride their ATVs when they are in the fields checking on things. I thought it was wearing a heavy brown coat with a cone shaped hood. There was fresh planted soy in the fields and I could see this thing from head to foot. When I first saw it I was about a 100 yards away. I was driving slowly. By the time I reached where he crossed the road he had covered at least 200 yards and walking away from me. I had no camera or binoculars with me that day. I turned down a farmers dirt track road to head toward the thing. When I merged on the road and drove toward it, it turned North and headed toward Katy Trail. I never got any closer to him than the 100 yards and that was because it was moving very fast, swinging its arms. I drove on back to my folks house after that.

"I was visiting my family’s former home and treated myself with a night’s stay at the cottages. They lie along the road running through from Deadwood to Rochford. The campground was empty save for me, even the proprietor was not home. They have beautiful pastures and a huge assortment of farm life - from turkeys to quail to goats and llamas donkeys and horses.  Their fields run right up to the forest, probably not even a football fields length away. I was sitting outside watching their antics and enjoying the evening air.  Suddenly, something started to howl in the woods to the west. Everything alive on the place froze in that same moment and all of their heads - mine included- swiveled toward the sound. I cannot begin to describe it, but I had grown up in these hills and know it was nothing I could identify.  The sound was somewhere between a howl and a scream and just echoed. It went on for 3-5 minutes, and every creature stopped to listen. I didn’t hear it again while there. I didn’t tell the proprietor when I saw him next. Since then, I’ve listened to recordings to try and identify the sound and the recent recording by the hunter out of Canada is an exact match. That’s what impelled me to report it.","Approximately 4 mi north of Rochford, at Carsten’s Cottages",Pennington County,South Dakota,Summer,44.21694,-103.7742,6/27/19,65588,Class B,78.92,67.96,57,0.83,Clear throughout the day.
I witnessed a 8-9 ft tall upright hominoid creature with black hair and brownish grey skin apparent on its face chest and abdomen. There was also noticeable scraggly matted hair hanging from its arms. It had wide bold shoulders and hair partly covering its forehead. The eyes were wide set and large.

"I was camping with my stepdaughter and one of her friends at the Big Bay Access Area on the Broad River.  Upon arrival at the campsite at 12:30 AM, as is our custom, my stepdaughter did a 2-3 second howl and I did a heavy growl.

"Observed a giant bi-pedal creature in the Cherokee National Forest in Unicoi County Tennessee near the North Carolina border. Creature was in the creek when I first saw it. The creature immediately sensed my presence and came out of the creek and placed its hand on a tree and hit the tree in a knocking manner approximately 4 times. I was trying to get my phone out and attempt to take a picture when the creature stomped the ground with its foot and growled something incredibly fierce several times. A growl I can best describe as a mix between a bear and a large canine. After the growl I started to retreat and as I did the creature took off in a run and vanished. I was in the very close range of 15 to 20 yards when I observed it. If there had not been running water I don't believe I would have gotten that close to it as it masked it hearing me and me hearing it. The time of day was 7 am and I was in the woods going to go trout fishing. I watched the creature for around 45 seconds and height estimate is at least 8feet and shoulder to shoulder 3 feet at least. The creature had brown and red hair that was very thick, yet had a shine in the coat, a flat face and a distinct, almost white nose that looked very wide and brown eyes. I am very fortunate to see what I saw and all the details of the creature as I was very close to it I am a believer in sasquatches and just feel so fortunate to have this experience. I didn't feel threatened by the creature just in awe of its massive size and agility as it lept out of the creek and how quickly it ran out of sight.","Near north Indian Creek Campground on Hwy 107 North, halfway between the town of Erwin TN and Buladean NC on the Unaka mountain range as part of the Cherokee National Forest.",Unicoi County,Tennessee,Fall,36.15588,-82.38587,11/11/12,37267,Class A,68.24,63.625,59.01,0.92,Mostly cloudy starting in the evening.
"I am an avid outdoors man, I canoe and camp on a regular basis, mostly by myself (nobody spends any time in the wild anymore). On my most recent canoe/camping trip I had set up camp started a fire, and and had just finished my dinner at around 9p.m. I had put my drinks in the water on the edge of the river and was walking down to the edge of the river to grab on, when in about ten yards of the edge I heard a big splash, something being thrown or dropped in the water, I didn't pay any attention so I kept walking, then as I approached the edge another even bigger splash was made and I could see the large rock that made it fly through the air hitting about ten yards from where I was. I froze and all the hair on my body stood straight up. I shined my led light over to the area and saw a set of eyes for about two seconds before they vanished.

"My husband and I saw a what we believe to be a Sasquatch on the night of June 12, 2021. We were driving home together with our daughter at approximately 9:30 PM when we turned onto our street. Mind you, we live in the deep country side outside of Lawrenceburg Tennessee. My husband turned the wheel slightly to turn onto our street and there was an animal with fingers touching something on the ground, picking at it with its fingers. When the animal saw our headlights turning, it intentionally averted the headlights and ducked underneath them. It was only about five feet from the front of our vehicle at one point when we turned toward it. It was fully in the headlights. The animal bounded across our neighbors yard. It did not run on two feet the way a human would. We thought the animal was a gorilla at first because of its movements but it looked extremely human like. It bounded with its front legs in the same way that a gorilla does except it’s arms were so long and it moved unbelievably fast. Of course we considered that it could have been a person dressed in a hairy costume but it moved way too fast to be a person. It was definitely not a bear. It was more like a gorilla or person covered with hair. It was covered in dark brown or black hair. The animal cleared our neighbors 250-300 foot grass lawn in about six seconds and then it disappeared from view. Our daughter who is four did not see the animal as she was playing on her iPad. When we pulled up to our house a minute later I was absolutely terrified to get out of the vehicle because we had no idea what we had seen, and because it was so fast that it could have turned around and been to our house in about 10 seconds. I got up the courage to run to my house door and unlocked it and we all ran inside. We were terrified. We both saw the animal, however it was my husband who saw that it had fingers and it was observing something on the ground. I did not see that part. I just saw the part where it started to run and when it cleared our neighbors lawn. We had considered that maybe it was a bear but it was too ape like to have been a bear and it was too fast and slim and did not run on all four of its legs exactly the way a bear would have.","Intersection of glen springs road and ridge lane.

"My wife and I were new to the area so we decided to check out Frozen Head State Park.  We drove there in the early afternoon and decided to try to walk one or two of the trails in the park.  We took our two dogs with us as they love to hike, and if no one else is near us, we let them off leash so they can run up and down the trail.  Today was different.  The dogs never got more than a couple of yards from us and seemed stressed.  We thought their conduct was odd, but credited their behavior to the fact that they had not been out much since we just moved.   We started along the Interpretive Trail loop near the Old Mac Trail head.  We were enjoying ourselves as there was no one else on the trail.  We stopped next to a creek and I thought I heard a single knock, like someone hitting a bat against a tree.  I asked my wife if she heard it and she confirmed she heard the noise as well.  We thought maybe it came from hikers up ahead.  We walked along a little farther and heard what sounded like a tree fall in the distance behind us.  There was a little wind, and we have heard trees fall in the woods before, so we continued walking thinking nothing of it. We finished the Interpretive Trail Loop and decided to try another trail, this one called the Judge Branch Trail.  This trail parallels a creek and so we were just walking enjoying the woods when we came upon a muddy area with a lot of deer tracks. I used to hunt in my youth and love trying to discern what animals are doing or where they are going by their tracks.  It seemed to me that two or more deer had been fighting or struggling in the area right off the trail, you could see various hoof prints going in different directions and the ground was torn up.  Looking for more signs we came upon the footprint that was in much more solid ground.  My wife (who is a skeptic) agreed with me that it looked like a large bare footprint and you could definitely see what might be a big toe and maybe indentions of smaller toes.  The print was off the trail and was perpendicular to the trail. There were some leaves and small sticks on top of the imprint which makes me think that it was an older print.  I weigh more than 280lbs and my shoes did not leave marks next to the print which was about a quarter to half inch in depth.  Not too long after this the dogs seemed to become more fearful, and my wife felt the hairs on the back of her neck raise up.   She felt uncomfortable and so we decided to end the hike and head back to the car.  We decided to put the leashes back on the dogs and they pulled hard towards the car.  When they got to the parking lot they once more became relaxed and calm. Also, I could find no other tracks, but we did not venture far off the trail either.  I am not familiar with bears but could this have been a bear track?  I would love to know.","It is in Frozen Head State Park, the trails have several camping areas.

It started the spring of 2013 late March-April. For about a month every night I would hear knocks about a couple minutes apart. This went on for a month. I live in the Hatchie River Bottoms. Around September of 2013 it started again. It has started again March of 2014. I have looked but can't see any thing. It is a very wooded area with a lot of wildlife. It seems to be passing thru. I am disabled and can't run into the woods. It usually stars about 8:30 or 9:00 at night. None of my neighbors report any noises. This month it only lasts to about 10:30.

My husband and I were on our way home last fall and we saw what can only be described as a bigfoot walk across the road in front of us. It was a cold rainy night and we were on the back roads to our house and we rounded a curve and our head light hit it. It was in the middle of the road and then it just took one step and it was off the road. It was brownish grey in color and it was wet with rain looked like a long hair dog when wet.

"I was walking in a field located at the base of Black Mountain, Crab Orchard, TN.  I had my wife and 2 daughters. As I walked I could sense apprehension from my girls and could feel myself. Feeling that this is from their usual fear of bears I continued the walk. As we made our way around the end of the field I looked up to notice a large black creature jump into the wood line. I looked back at my wife and the words I spoke were “That was big” ...   I keep wanting to say it was a wild boar or maybe even bear. That would be fine but it walked on 2 legs and had a backside of a human or ape. And also moved like a bipedal creature.",Base of Black Mountain,Cumberland County,Tennessee,Spring,35.8823,-84.88694,4/20/20,65654,Class B,64.81,57.38,49.95,0.94,Rain in the morning.

"I know there will be many who will not believe what I am about to relate as I am still having trouble coming to terms with all of it myself. My plan was to not post anything about what happened last night and pretend it was all just a dream - but the nightmare continues to haunt me even during the day.  I can’t shake the image I had seen or the sounds I had heard.  And the only way for me to make sense of and deal with any of it is to write it down while it’s still fresh in my memory. I’ll just come out and say it.  Last night (Friday, June 23, 2017) I saw a very large and tall “thing” in our backyard, and it would seem to have been the being otherwise known as (dare I say it?) BIG FOOT! I’m sure it sounds crazy, but it’s true.  And I consider myself to be one who quickly debunks extraordinary claims by others concerning UFO activity, Lock Ness Monster shenanigans, and - yes - even BIG FOOT sightings. Our youngest son used to watch those goofy BIG FOOT shows to where my wife and I would offhandedly snicker to one another at his fervent belief in something so obviously fake. Come on!  None of that stuff is real.  It’s made up by kids, people who are in desperate need of professional assistance, or those  seeking attention.  I wish what I experienced wasn’t true, and fell into one of the aforementioned categories as my life would be less complicated. Here’s what happened: It all started off as a regular Friday evening.  Drum students were drumming in the studio, our children were playing video games,   my wife was cleaning, and I was working on writing parts for an upcoming show.  Something I do best while enjoying the company of great music. I remember loudly listening to 2112 and the A side of the album had run it’s course, requiring me to get up and turn the record over in order to listen to the B side.  As I approached the turntable I thought I had seen someone running down by our creek area.  Which is odd because the individual would have to be very tall, much taller than what would be considered a normal sized person, for me to see from where I had been standing.  I stopped the record player and curiously walked over to the french doors located on the West side of our home. Everything appeared quiet and normal.  I didn’t notice anything.  I thought nothing more about it (at the time) and went back to attending to my music writing.  This is when things suddenly became …strange. While listening to the song “Twilight Zone” (by Rush) I heard an unusual howling-type noise which created a dissonant clash with what I was accustomed to hearing during that particular song.  At first I thought something may have been wrong with my speakers, but the bizarre sound continued even when I had turned the music off. It almost sounded like a “hoot,” though much deeper and varied. Our three dogs began nervously congregating by the door, and seemed extremely agitated as each paced back and forth.  They even began doing their own unusual howling, something I had never witnessed any of them to do prior to (or since) yesterday evening. I thought there must have been another dog or possibly one of the wild coyotes recently observed in our neighborhood, hanging out by the creek. In order to ensure the safety of our dogs (I didn’t want any of our pets getting rabies, or eaten!) I grabbed a broom - not the best choice for a weapon - and opened the door to investigate. This is where things happened rapidly.  It’s all pretty much a big blur at this point. As I shut the door our littlest dog (Elphaba) squeezed through the narrow opening and bolted toward the back fence overlooking the creek area. She looked cute running at breakneck speed.  That was until I looked up and noticed this large creature in our creek area glancing in our direction by the swing - with glowing greenish-yellow eyes - as it quickly turned away and ran to the South, following the flow of our creek until it quickly disappeared. I was stunned.  Where I was expecting a little nuisance I had found a magnificently imposing creature.  The likes of which I hadn’t thought possible, much less probable. It was surreal to watch such a large creature move so quickly as it bounded toward highway 79, and retreated underneath the overpass and beyond. I only caught a brief glimpse of the thing.  It was tall, hairy, had large feet, and it was extraordinarily fast for it’s size. All that remained was the memory of those few fleeting seconds, and a swing gently swayed in the wake of the awesome being’s hasty movements. Apparently my wife had heard our dogs making their odd noises  in our home and opened the door only to find me standing along the edge of our fence holding our littlest dog and staring at…nothing. I didn’t know how to respond when she asked me what it was that I was looking at - for I wasn’t sure for myself. The last thing we both heard was that strange sounding and ear-piercing howling-hoot.  We just looked at one other while our dogs responded in kind with their own versions of the odd sound. My wife had asked what made the noise, and I didn’t know what to say. It was a rough night.  I had read the claims by the folks in our Round Rock Parks & Recreation Department, and subsequent sightings.  It all had seemed so silly, even childish. And yet, overnight, my opinion had changed - in a huge way. It’s a big deal for me to share what I experienced in our creek area last night.  I have a feeling there will be unbelievers (heck, I had been one myself).  I’m ok with that as I know what we heard and what I saw.  And Elphaba saw it, too. And the weirdest thing of all was how happy our dogs seemed once they were all outside.  As if they were glad to be around a long lost friend.  They were smelling vigorously, and wagged their tails as they looked toward where the swing was still moving. The best thing is we feel confident we’ll know if we’re ever visited again as our dogs will most likely make those same strange sounds, perhaps as an announcement letting us know of their returning friend. And we will be ready next time, camera in hand.

"This sighting has stayed with me for a long time.  I didn't want to submit it at first, but based on the number of sightings identified I am now forwarding on what I saw. My son and I were driving down county road 200 in Liberty Hill, TX.  We came to the end and made a right turn on county road 236.  We were heading towards Killeen, TX at the time and it was in the morning. At the time, the car I was driving had two little plastic pieces on the front of it that were designed to create sound to scare away deer.  I got them because my car was a small car and I didn't know if they would help, but as this is an area with a lot of deer, it was worth a try.  I am not sure if this is what scared what I saw. Just after we made the right on county road 236 I saw what I thought was a gorilla on the left side of the road.  It seemed agitated and as we got closer it ran across the road and climbed into a tree on the other side.  At that point I saw the tree move wildly with the leaves and branches swaying like it was extremely angry, or like a strong wind had hit it.  As the day was calm the only thing that could have caused this was whatever jumped into the tree. I didn't look up and I didn't stop due to my son being with me, but that sighting has always remained with me as it was so unusual.  I have seen gorillas in the zoo and it looked similar.  I would say that it was relatively tall and was standing on its hind legs as I got closer to it and as it raced across the street in front of us.  It didn't seem as tall as I would have imagined... maybe 6ft.  It was hard to tell height from where I was in correlation to what I saw. After this event I checked to see if a gorilla had escaped anywhere near me and didn't find anything.  To many this will sound like a tall tale, but to me it was very vivid.","This is a back road just north of Liberty Hill that anyone can get to, but it's a road that didn't have a high amount of traffic at the time.

"I have multiple reports to make. Bigfoot is living in the Angelina National Forest, no doubts. My husband grew up hunting there, but I have only been hunting in there for the past 4-5 years. Geography, it is on Sam Rayburn lake, piney woods with thick yaupon brush and a public hunting area that is very secluded. We typically hunt between a dirt road and the lake, there are 'fingers' or peninsulas of land. I grew up very close to the Big Thicket & spent my life in the woods but I began to feel uncomfortable in there, unlike hunting or hiking anywhere else. My husband also noticed this feeling of being watched or hunted, as did guest we brought with us. The 1st experience, my husband was sitting on the ground hunting for deer. He saw some movement far up in a pine tree. There are large birds (eagles/hawks/woodpeckers etc) so that's what he expected it to be. But a head and shoulders peeked around, looked at him, out stretched an arm and then it jumped to the next tree over. Then it proceeded to jump from tree to tree approaching towards him. It was small woman/large child sized and too far away to make out much other than its shape. But it clearly was ape-like. He left before it got any closer & we left out of there for the day. No other experiences that year (2016). I dubbed this general area bigfoot's backyard, jokingly. At this point I knew he saw something but I wasn't REALLY ready to call it Bigfoot. We no longer camped out there after that. The next year I was in Bigfoot's backyard walking very slow & quiet listening for squirrels. I was squirrel hunting dressed in camo and was closer to the dirt road than the lake. It was in October and almost dark when I heard this growl (if you can call it that!). It came from the thick brush about 50' behind me. It was the deepest most guttural GRR-UMPH. We don't really have bear here but I fully expected to turn around to a grizzly bear as loud & deep as the growl was, but I didn't see anything. We left immediately. Later in Nov. my husband was hunting a few hundred yards from that spot and something growled & growled at him until he left. Deep deep guttural growling. This was (2017) and we no longer waited until after dark to leave our hunting spots. A couple of acquaintances of my husband, a father & son, was looking for a public land spot to hunt deer. He gave them a tour of the spots off of that dirt road. These guys moved here from bear country, so let that be known. They had tree climbing stands, so no visible ladder from the ground. They go out there by themselves, they pick bigfoots backyard to hunt in. The son arrives 1st and and climbs 30' up a tree. It is the exact spot I was growled at before. A little later the dad arrives. He comes in, crosses a little creek right by the son & goes down toward the lake. It gets quiet then the son heard something walking, he naturally thinks it's a deer. He watched a huge dark hairy creature walking upright on two legs, not just walk in the direction of where his dad went, but walk the exact trail he took. There isn't phone signal in that spot. He told me he wasn't about to move in case it saw him. The dad was never aware he was stalked by bigfoot, climbed up in the tree and didn't see anything out of the ordinary. They never went back. I think that was in 2017, November or December. This year my husband went out there first and hunted bigfoot's backyard and told me it felt comfortable in there. This lulled me into going back out there. I didn't feel comfortable at all. I heard strange whistling and sniffing noises, and the next time, loud repetitive whoop whoop whoop. I declared the woods still had bigfoot & few deer and I wasn't returning anymore. So husband goes a few times by himself. One evening, he sits in a lean-to stand that is maybe 1/8 of a mile from bigfoot's backyard. It has a ladder and is 12' off the ground. This is a new hunting spot and unfortunately a bigfoot hunting party stumbles onto my husband. He is facing a draw with a small creek that runs down to the lake (to his left). The dirt road is through some thick yaupon brush to his right. Behind him and across the draw is thick yaupon brush also. They clear cut timber company land a few hundred yards ahead of him, although it's not visible from the stand. It's a Monday and he is the only human out there hunting, 5:15pm November 18, 2019. He see the back end of a deer go into the woods. It had crossed the draw, had come in down wind and was heading towards the clear cut area. My husband was dressed in full camo, didn't spray scent killer and had in fact gotten scented candle on himself. He hears a strange deep HUM-Phhh from the youpon behind and to his left. At first he thought it could have been a deer, although a strange noise for a deer. It makes a low growing noise and starts moving back & forth in the brush. Its obviously big & heavy. Then it starts UMPH UMPH UMPH very loudly. This makes my husband VERY uncomfortable. Then it does a howl, like a wolf, but cuts it short. Like a 2 second extremely loud howl that just abruptly ends. Hair raising howls. Another abrupt howl answers him from down the draw towards the lake followed by three loud knocks, loud as gunshots. We assume they were tree knocks. Then the one closest starts talking in gibberish. Hearable but not loudly. My husband announces that if it a person playing a joke they are about to get shot at. The gibberish stops and is replaced by even louder growling and it advances towards him. He fires a shot from his rifle towards the growling because at this point he is fearful of being attacked. They start charging towards him. He could see the tops of the youpon parting way. The loud growling and brush was breaking so loud. He shimmied down the ladder and ran for his truck pushing his way through the brush. The two growling creatures stayed just a little bit behind him all the while growling, breaking over small trees & just ripping brush up. They chased him to the road, but never stepped out. He ran to his truck and left. Based on these experiences there are some facts that I truly believe. Bigfoot is a real animal not a mythical creature. It is smart, hunts in pairs or groups and is definitely a meat eating predator, and in this area deer & wild hog are plentiful. It has communicative skills, although primitive. It has a VERY good sense of smell that would rival that of a dog/hog/deer. Their young spend alot of time in the trees. They drive their prey into areas where it is easier to catch, like close to water. They most likely have ""scouts"" when humans are in the area & their family unit is close by. They do not like humans to surprise them and will do their best to scare the humans out of their territory if they deem them too close or dangerous.",National Forest public hunting land at Sam Rayburn lake,San Augustine County,Texas,Fall,31.1659,-94.1679,11/18/19,63665,Class A,72.64,57.675,42.71,0.72,Clear throughout the day.
"I had just loaded some oil drilling equipment to haul back to the oil company yard for them. I had been driving down the lease road going through a very large ranch on the Canadian River Valley in the Texas Panhandle. It was about 7:30 p.m.  I was driving very slow, approximately 10-15 MPH, because the ranch has speed limits on their lease roads and the roads are very rough. This location is on private property and out of respect for the landowner I will not disclose the location. It is a very desolate area, about 23 miles to the nearest town. There are very few homes in the area with about 5-10 miles between homes. It was unusual weather for mid-July. It was warm but overcast with clouds and a breeze coming out the north. It was still very bright for it was over an hour before sunset. I was driving along noticing how heavy the plum bushes were loaded. We haven’t had a good crop of Sand Plums in several years on account of the severe drought that we had been suffering from. I noticed out of my peripheral vision what looked to be a very tall and very thick butt of a bull. I kept thinking this was very unusual to see a river ranch bull that is so large and thick. I have only seen this type of bull on the show circuit, I have showed cattle in 4-H and FFA and my kids showed cattle also, I grew up on a dairy farm and we also raised beef cattle, I have raised cattle for over 40 years and been around many different breeds of cattle, yet this one was exceptionally large. As I got closer to this bull I starting getting a clearer look at it.  Bulls this thick typically don't have much of a tail head, they are pretty flat topped, but this one did. As I got closer I realized he didn't have a tail at all.  The hair was wrong and too long for a bull. It was brown with a reddish tint on the ends as if sun bleached. This bull has 4-6 inch long, bleached out strawberry blonde, matted hair hanging just above mid-point on him. I then notice that I couldn’t see under this bull, and that it’s very wide at the ground level. This made no sense. By this time, there was no brush between me and him to block my view of this thing! He was standing in the open on bare ground. There was a large shade tree; the cattle used a good bit because there was no grass around the tree. Then it HIT me, this is a Bigfoot. I cannot believe it. Not 70 feet from me. My pickup and trailer are a total of 65 feet long so it was pretty easy to figure the distance to him. I realize I caught the big fellow out in the wide open. I knew I was coming up on a curve in the road and I could drive off into a deep ditch so I looked up to stay on the road, hitting my brakes to stop. I didn't take my eyes off of him for more than 2 seconds, but that was all he needed. He was gone. There is a small canyon about 30 feet to the south of where he was.  I believe he went that direction.  I jumped out of my truck and ran down to the end of my trailer to try to see this massive creature again, then I realized, with its size and speed that was probably not a good idea. As I walked back to my truck, watching my back, I knew where he had been standing and that there was probably footprints and knuckle prints there that I could take pictures of, I had my camera with me, and I’d have proof to show my family of what I saw. But I also knew he could be on top of me in 2 seconds if I went over there. I had my phone and my camera with me but it never entered my mind to grab them while the creature was standing there in front of me. I have always heard of these being described as massive creatures. Truly that is the only way to describe it. The shoulders and arms were massive. I didn't get a good look at its face because I was too busy  wondering why I couldn't see under it, so I focused more on the lower half. But I did notice the contrasting colors of its face. It was lighter around the eyes and darker over the nose and I think I caught him with sand plums in his mouth because of the red tint in the lip area. He looked to be at least 5' 6"" tall down on his knuckles and could be easily taller than that. He was very wide, I am 6'3"" and 235 lbs and he was at least 1 1/2 to 2 of me in width. Down on my knuckles I am on 3 feet tall. I know their arms are longer than humans, but this still makes him a very tall boy! I have had to estimate the weight of cattle most of my life and was always been within 10 -25 lbs of guessing them correctly. And I would estimate him weighing in the neighborhood of 850 lbs. With that said he could easily weigh more because of the shear muscle mass that I could see.",Directions will be given to investigator.,Roberts County,Texas,Summer,35.93985,-100.6767,7/14/14,56826,Class A,90.59,78.215,65.84,0.58,Mostly cloudy until afternoon.
"I was hunting in Reklaw in the Angelina river bottom. I was in a pasture with a .243 and a high power scope. It was about 45 minutes till dark and my feeder just went off there were some doe out to the right of the feeder about 100yards. I was watching them then out of the corner of my eyes I seen something walking on 2 feet I pulled my rifle up to look through the scope and seen it was big and brown. It had hair all over it, it was like nothing I have ever seen. It came out of some woods in the neighbors pasture and was walking towards me.

"12-6-2014 to 10-2015 Incident began with rocks being chunked at my daughter, myself and my brother after returning from visiting my Dad in hospital. We stopped to report his condition to my brother. We were very loud, laughing and talking and a rock chunked from out in the yard in the trees. At that time no homes nearby as we live rural. Two wks before my Dad was putting his trash in the can and happened to feel someone watching him and he looked up to see in the moonlight (full moon) dead on straight away about 20 ft from him a tall 8ft brownish figure looking at him. They stared at each other for a long moment and my Dad tossed his trash, looked up and it was gone. My Dad doesn't believe in Bigfoot but my brother is disabled and sits up outside on the patio every night. He had heard whoops, stick fighting, growling and saw figures at the fence line. I decided to try interacting with whatever it was so I began wrapping sandwiches, cookies, veggies, meat, eggs etc. every day I made a lunch which I wrapped in bread wrapper and placed in Plastic grocery bag and hung in a tree branch near where we heard noises. Everyday the food was gone. Once it left me 5 potatoes from the neighbors garden above us. I would leave a dozen raw eggs or boiled an they tap the ends of the eggs and suck the middle. They did not eat celery, carrots or spicy crackers, but loved tortillas, breads, cake, all meats and peanut butter or nuts. I fed for almost a year and smelled them many many times, we heard a sweet growl several times. Once my brother saw its backside walking to a tree. It chunked some rocks at me as I was at the far end of the pasture. Each toss the rock became closer. My brother said come back before it hits you. I began walking back and he pointed where it was beside a tree and I saw the side of it. About 8 ft tall grayish/ brownish like tree bark. I began calling it ""Trudy"" when feeding it. Sometimes it would let me know it was there, and if it was, all was totally silent, nothing moving. When coyotes would be howling nearby it would let out a shrill scream and the woods became silent. I sat many evenings beside gift tree and it never hurt me. Never attempted to hurt me. Actually would give a low growl. Once I left a pink cup to see what it would do and it would toss it in the ditch. I hung a tiny angel Christmas ornament and they removed it and never found it. One evening my husband drove up and they tossed rocks at his truck. We mounted a game cam but never had any pics except of myself feeding. Many pics of orbs. My brother said he thinks by voices and calls there was male, female and young ones. I know for fact they are harmless and are very caring. Two new homes moved into our area and they have now left us. I miss them and still go down into the pasture hoping they will throw a rock. 4-2016 coming in from nearest town approaching a bridge repair so I slowed down and it was 7:15 on a clear evening I saw standing in a clearing a huge dark reddish brown figure in the tree line. I was shocked to see it dead on in open daylight. I looked back at my lane and over to clearing & it was gone. Its hair looked 5 inches long on the head to the neck area and 8 inches on the body. It was standing in tall grass so couldn't see below waist. After interacting and watching for a year I notice the hair color changes with the season. There are many ditches, reservoirs, acres of uninhabited woods and many creek beds. We have gardens, wild berries and wild plums so I think they can stay hidden. I have pics of tracks, I have bags I saved she left me to refill. I don't care what scientist say I know they are real and very sweet. Nobody should hurt them as I think they'd only hurt you if you tried to cause them harm.

"Back in 1999, I moved to Leona, in Leon County, Texas.  The house was an old victorian with a huge S-shaped porch.  It had not been lived in (before me) for 17 years yet, it had been used temporarily as a hunting lodge.  The house was located on the front 40 acres of a large 600 acre piece of property.  This property was bordered in the front, by Hwy 1119 and in the back, by Boggy Creek (the Texas Boggy Creek.)  There was no other house in sight or within a quarter of a mile. I moved there with my two younger children, who were 6 and 8 years old.  They were not accustomed to living in the country.  At night, to the north of us, near where Boggy Creek crossed Hwy 1119, my children and I would hear very loud howls.  They did not sound like a wolf or anything. I am an experienced hunter. The howls sounded more like eery ghosts!  Just after the howling (each time), we'd hear the coyotes start their cackling.  With the howls, my children would say (in the whispering fearful voices), ""what's that Mom?""  I told them I didn't know.  At that time, I never thought of Bigfoot. In the summer of 2000, my children left to visit with their father.  I was all alone on the 600 acres, with my dog Lucy Catahoula/Husky mix) and my 5 cats.It was very quiet with the children gone.  One night my dog Lucy started going crazy with barking and I suddenly heard coyotes all around my house.  I believe they were after my cats.  I ran out into the yard where I had a large bell attached to a pole.  I began ringing the bell and yelling, ""Get out of here!""  I kept yelling as they began to run away.  I continuing with the yelling ""Get out of here"" as I ran around my yard.  Just beyond the light of the porch, at the edge of the darkness near my driveway gate lined with shrubs, I yelled once more.  Something just in front of me, in the total darkness, growled deeply and loudly back at me!  I was completely surprised and the first thing I thought was, ""That's weird, coyotes don't usually growl back at people!""  I wondered why this one was so brave and wasn't running off with the rest of them. Not being a bigfoot follower at that time, it never crossed my mind to be scared.  I responded to the growl with, ""Oh yeah?  I'm going to get my truck!""  I ran into the house, grabbed my keys, and got out into my Ford Ranger.  I backed it up and turned the headlights straight into the shrubs by the driveway.  I saw something that looked gray in color. It turned, jumped right over my barbed wire fence and started running humped over or on all fours, across the tall grass pasture next to my driveway.  I was totally confused on what I might be seeing.  The only detail I could see was that the gray hair on it's back was thin and long, seeing skin underneath, and the hair was somewhat parted down the middle. I backed my truck up and headed out of the driveway to follow this thing.  I drove north on Hwy 1119, paralleling it in the field.  It finally veered off to the right and went further out in the field (towards Boggy Creek) where I could no longer see it.  I kept pondering on what the animal could have been.  Coyotes don't have long hair like that did. Now, I believe it was a sasquatch.","It was on Hwy 1119, just south of Hwy 977 intersection, middle of the country.

"Driving home from taking my kids to school. The area is very wooded, lots of wildlife (deer, wild pigs, armadillo). I was driving on 450 and was slowing down to turn on to Old Avinger Road when I saw something move just behind the first line of trees on my right. It was tall and black, definitely not any of the previously mentioned animals. The deep black color is what made it stand out to me because although the area is wooded it was sunny out and the black color looked out of place with all the other shadows. It's size and color made it stick out. When I slowed to look more it ran into the wooded area fast, not on 4 legs. It was definitely upright and on 2 thick legs. I couldn't see its entire body. What I saw was at least 5 to 6 feet above the edge of the road, and the ground were it was standing is 2 to 3 feet lower than the road. Took me a minute to process what I saw and go through all the wildlife possibilities, but based on the size, shape and speed I don't think it was any of the native wildlife we know of.","32.793376, -94.694120 Exact coordinates from Google maps [Click here for Google Map pin for where the figure was standing:",Marion County,Texas,Fall,32.79338,-94.69412,9/22/21,70712,Class B,82.56,65.86,49.16,0.57,Clear throughout the day.
"On Monday, January 4, 2016, at 6 a.m., I was backcountry camping with a friend in the Sam Houston National Forest. We had made camp near an unnamed pond west of the Hiking Trail. The night was clear, 35 degrees, and perfectly still. My friend and I were hammock camping and, because of the cold, were both under low-staked tarps that prevented us from seeing out. Our hammocks were about 15 yards apart. At 6 a.m. it was still completely dark. I had been awake for about 15 minutes but remained in my sleeping bag inside my hammock. At that point I heard a sharp clack perhaps 75 yards on the other side of my friend. Two seconds later I heard a double-knock much farther away, perhaps a ½ mile to the north or northwest. The first pop was crisp and close. To my ears it had to be either rock on rock or wood on wood. As there is nothing in that area but sandy soil and trees, my conclusion was that this was a well-struck tree knock followed by a distant response. To the best of our knowledge there were no other people in the vicinity. We had arrived at the trail head to begin our one-night backpacking trip at 2 p.m. the previous afternoon, and we had only seen one other party of hikers, who passed our camp at 4:30 Sunday afternoon and continued eastward on the trail; we saw no one else during the entire trip, which ended when we arrived back at the parking lot at 11:30 a.m. Monday morning. Had it been windy I could have written the sounds off to cracking limbs, but there was not the slightest breeze, and the two sounds appeared to me to be a clear call and response, perhaps: “Humans over here"" … ""Roger that.” After the sounds, I froze and listened hard for several minutes for any other noise such as footfalls, stick breaks or other evidence of visitors but heard none. Within five minutes I asked my friend if he had heard it and he had not, having his ears covered by his cap and his head inside his sleeping bag at the time. Within 15 minutes we both were asleep again. We awoke for good at about 7:20 a.m. and vacated the area at 10 a.m. We heard distant coyotes, dogs, ducks, and owls, but no other such sounds during our stay. The absence of footfalls or other noises initially made me think it must have not been a sasquatch, but on reflection, the visitor could easily have frozen in his spot when he discovered our camp and then moved slowly away, perhaps using fallen logs, 15 minutes later once we were back to sleep. Considering the stillness of the night, the crisp, unambiguous clack, and the quick double-knock response, I can think of no other cause for these sounds.",,Montgomery County,Texas,Winter,30.52897,-95.72607,1/4/16,50643,Class B,59.82,46.33,32.84,0.83,Clear throughout the day.

"Hello, my name is Ricardo. On Friday the 23rd of October, 2020, my wife and I were seeing if a restaurant in Texas was opened so we could have lunch. It was around 1 pm. The name of the restaurant is called the Catfish Cafe, located just West of Weatherford, Texas on Interstate Hwy 20, right next to the Brazos River. There was only one worker at the restaurant, and he told us that the restaurant would not open until 4pm. So, my wife and I decided to drive around the countryside in that area and kill some time until 4 pm. Immediately just west of the restaurant about 50 yards or so, is a bridge that goes across the Brazos River. We headed across it and stopped in the center of the bridge to look at the river scenery when we spotted a huge dark figure on the river wading in the water around ankle deep. This thing was about a quarter mile north from the bridge. At first we thought it could be a man that was kicking the water, chasing a possible fish or something, but looking at the object a little closer, we knew that it was not a man because it was dark, tall, and hairy. We believe that it was a bigfoot looking for his meal. We stayed there on the bridge for a good 5 minutes, as no cars were coming. We drove around for awhile after that and came back to the restaurant about 3:45 pm stopping again on the bridge to see if that thing was still there. It wasn't, and we then got our food to go and went back home to our house in Weatherford. You guys are the first people we have told about this incident.","West of Weatherford, Texas.

"It was Thanksgiving 2007 in Houston County Texas. Outside of Grapeland Texas, on a private ranch. My brother-in-law asked if I wanted to go with him and my father-in-law to the private ranch that he managed and check the hog traps he had set. They had been overrun with them for a while and he had caught 20 in the past weeks. I said yes, and we were off, it was mid day and still bright and clear.

"I live in Greenville, Tx, north of town, just off hwy 69 North. I have lived here 12 years and have had strange things going on at my house since I moved here. But in the last 2 to 3 yrs, things have really started happening more. I live down a dirt road off of hwy 69. There are a lot of woods around me, also have several neighbors around me too. In late summer of 2017, I was jolted awake in the middle of the night by a loud banging on my house. I knew I wasn’t dreaming because I shot straight up; and at that exact moment, my two little dogs flew off my bed barking and carrying on. I stumbled into the kitchen wondering what could be happening and it was 2:38 am. My two big dogs outside were not barking, which I thought was odd. To make a long story short, I called the sheriff's department. Two deputies came out and found nothing. From that moment on, every 2 or 3 months, I have several incidents for a week or two, then nothing for another month or two or three, then things happen again. This past winter from Nov. 2019 to Feb. 2020, I have had several things happen. On three separate occasions while I have been propped in bed watching TV, I have heard a loud growl outside my bedroom loud enough to hear over the TV. It was loud and guttural. I have had tapping on the back of my house during the night. It is usually always around the same time of night. In Jan 2020, I was once again propped up in bed watching TV and over my TV, I heard something rubbing on the back of my house on the wall where my bathroom is. My bedroom and bathroom run together. My two little dogs jumped off the bed into bathroom at the back wall barking. I’ve had rocks thrown at my house.  I’m home alone most of the time. But this past Sat. night, April 18, 2020, my husband happened to be home. Between 11:00 and 11:30 pm, my dog started barking and wouldn’t stop, so I got up to holler at her to hush. As I got to my bedroom door, my cat was laying in my rocking chair next to my door.  I paused to pet her and about that time, I heard that same loud, guttural growl at my back door. My cat heard it, wheeled around, and looked at the back door. I went and woke my husband up. He looked out the back door and saw nothing. I went to the front door and opened it and called my dog. She would not get close to the fence and was barking, looking towards the back of my house towards my neighbor's home behind me. All of a sudden, she jumped back, like whatever it was was coming towards her. I ran to my guest room to look out the window facing that direction; and back towards northwest, I saw something huge and dark in color going across my neighbor's back pasture, moving fast.

"My son and 2 nephews went feral hog hunting in North Texas recently and we experienced noises from what we believe were 2 entities other than people.  Were were hunting a remote Texas Ranch at night with no light with the exception of a motion activated green light that would shine if an animal walked within 10 yards and 145 degree radius of the light standing 3 feet on a stick in the ground.  We were placed onto our milk carton ""chairs"" behind dead vegetation about 2 feet high and 40 yards from the light placed over a pile of corn placed by the rancher.  We sat down just before dark at 9PM and waited. I wore binoculars and glassed our area before dark to become familiar with the terrain and where the pigs might trail to the corn.  At 200 yards behind us in a brush area, I noted an animal lying down and looking towards us.  It was only a quartering appearance, but I noticed it was eating something.  I could not identify the animal, only movement and a dark hairy head. At midnight, we began to hear bipedal movement to our right about 40 yards away and a light breeze wafted an incredibly terrible smell towards us.  We hear grunting and branch breaking.  Within 20 minutes tree knocking began.  It was rapid 3-5 almost staccato knocks answered almost immediately approximately 75 yards to our left in 2-3 slower knock responses.  Whistling started and my son became very frightened.  The green light went on without any noted animal, so I aimed my .45-70 rifle at the lit ground and fired one round into the dirt near the light.  We then heard 2 sets of bipedal footsteps running away from us to our left over the ridge towards my nephews. The sound of the running was very heavy footfalls of what sounded like large animals.  We called our guide and requested to be picked up, and he arrived 30 minutes later.  My nephews reported hearing the running, and they saw one pair of glowing eyes 8-9 inches apart about 8 feet off the ground 20 yards from their boxed blind, and it scared them.  They also heard tree knocking and whoops.  They had heard my shot and said it correlated with running towards their blind and subsequent observations they made.

"I think I may have seen a Sasquatch near the Montgomery Game Ranch in Jack county last night, slightly before midnight.  A few friends and I were dirt road driving through several very wild and remote parts of our county. We stopped to look and listen. I put my generation one night vision monocular on the edge of a clearing. I noticed a large, black, and roundish shape. I thought it might be a cow but when I focused on it, it stood up slowly on two legs, appeared to be very tall, and took three or four really long, liquid, and smooth steps to get behind a nearby mesquite tree. It appeared to be a huge, man like figure. It appeared to me to be moving slowly to avoid detection, i.e. moving slowly and smoothly with no sudden movements. I tried to zoom in but all I could make out was a huge black shape behind the tree. I was not able to record it and I was the only one in the group who saw it. It's size and the fluidity of its movements are what stuck in my mind the most. It was more coordinated and smoother than even a wild cat. After growing up on a cattle ranch in this part of the country and spending many years as a park ranger, I have seen many wild animals. This was like nothing I have ever seen before.

I was hunting on opening of rifle season for whitetail deer in east Texas, Jasper county.

It lasted for about 5 seconds.  about 5-10 seconds later I heard a response call that was a much lower tone at the same distance to the right.  It was about the tone of an owl, but again, maintained a consistent pitch that just stopped and it didn't have breaks like an owl sound.  Again the response was about 5 seconds.  I shrugged it off thinking this wasn't real.  About 5 min later I got out of my blind and walked to my truck to get binoculars and I thought I heard something that sounded like a person saying, ""Hey You"" but the speech was very low and very gargled.  I thought to myself, "" I will go about my way and leave whatever it is alone and it will probably leave me alone.""  I got back in my blind and resumed hunting.

"My son and I were driving at 10mph north on Bragg Rd. to see its famous swamp gas lights, with just my parking-lights on. As we neared the end of the road, within sight of the farm-road, a large, solid-black animal came out of the woods on the east side of the road, walking slowly on two legs. It was between 7-8 feet tall, and solid-black. It looked like it had a healthy-weight, more than a human. Definitely not a black bear! It appeared trim and muscular, with it's long arms hanging down past it's knees. It's upper-profile reminded me of ""Homer Simpson"" (best description I can think of). The thing was about 20ft. from the front of the pick-up, causing me to come to a stop. It knew my truck was there, but it continued it's slow pace, seemingly without care. The scariest part of the encounter was when it paused and looked at us. It's eyes reflected like glowing embers when the parking lights from my truck hit it. The thing continued walking, stepping over the road-grade and continuing into the forest. I stopped my truck and I could still hear it crunching around in the woods out of sight now as it walked away. I am a retired combat veteran and I don't scare easy, but I was. We left immediately. My son only caught the tail end of the sighting but confirmed he saw something. The dirt road was well packed so I couldn't see any footprints left behind. It was very unsettling for me because it looked so human, and because it had the size and presence that it could have harmed us or done serious damage to my truck if it wanted to. I used to enjoy hiking and sleeping alone in the woods at night in my hammock, but not anymore.

"I live near the Comal and Hays county line in Texas. This is hill country right on the Devil's Backbone.  This area has lots of heavy oak and juniper with several spring fed rivers; Guadalupe with Canyon Lake near and the Blanco just to the north. September 2012 on a weekend I was enjoying a moonless night packed with stars. I began to hear dogs barking in the distance to the west. More local dogs started barking. I was expecting to hear the coyotes to chime in as they often do on the hill behind my place. Instead my two 100+lb boxer/labs started going nuts. They would not leave the porch to go into the woods as they often do chasing pigs, coyotes or the neighbor's bull.  I had been out on the driveway and went up on the porch. I stood there and tried to get the dogs to go after whatever it was. I tell you the wind was out of the south. Reason being, as I stepped around the corner of the house something big let out a holler, I can not explain. I think it smelled me then. It was close, probably within 20 yards?  Just past where I have cleared all the trees .  The holler, yell was so strong it felt like it shook my insides. Vibrated.  Everything went stone quiet. All the neighboring dogs and mine went totally silent.their hair on their backs was raised and they were locked on something down hill.  Then off to my right, heading up a tight valley I heard wild pigs grunting and then the sound of a couple raccoons?  I couldn't, understand why they would be together?  Then after a few short minutes the dogs up hill started going nuts and then beyond. Like something was moving fast and the dogs were picking up on it.  I told my dogs to go on down the hill into the woods, they did no problem. Never heard again, I wonder what may have happened if I had gone down there without my dogs?",RR 32 Devil's Backbone Texas Hill Country.

"On January 9th, 2015 @ about 5:20-5:30 p.m. at Canyon Lake, Texas, my family and I were backing out of our drive way, and the weather was bad that day, kind of hazy, misty rain, and it was about 37 degrees. I had my high beams on because it was beginning to get dark outside.  As I backed out of the driveway my lights caught the attention of a very big creature about 9 foot tall grayish blonde in color with a 4 to 4 1/2 ft across from shoulder to shoulder, standing in front of an oak tree, it turn towards me from about 40 yards away, and it stood with its arms down at it's side, I asked my son to look and I looked away briefly, when I looked back it was gone.  The following Friday my wife and step daughter, while walking along the shoreline of the lake, discovered a bloody and strange deer kill site (fresh kill), the deer's neck was broken and twisted all he way around, lungs, heart, and liver were gone and the deer's intestinal content was thrown about, the back half of the deer was eaten,the front shoulder was eaten,but not the other shoulder. I called the BFRO and left a message, J.D. from San Antonio came out and took pictures of the scene, I asked him if I should roll the deer over because of the shoulder bone sticking out.  After rolling over I pulled the hide back and there was a sharp edged stone underneath the hide with flesh and blood on the stone--I kept this stone--there was also a 10 feet dragging kill-blood streak across the rocks, then it abruptly stops, and the deer's carcass seems to be thrown about 15 feet from that spot with no blood stains in between the two spots.  Upon further investigating I discovered a 5 foot long stick about 1 1/4 in diameter-rigid, with a sharp end on it, and the end of it had deer hair and flesh on it, like it was used to either stab the deer or just to hold it down, then it broke the deers neck, the kill was made from the waters edge side not the woods side, meaning the thing that killed the deer was hiding in the water...I also discovered tracks some were 19 inches long but were not castable, not enough definition, also found some tracks that were 14 inches long, and some 11 inches long along the shoreline down from the kill site, all of them were not castable it had also been raining that whole week off and on.  Upon even more research we discovered At least 5 other deer carcasses in the general area.  Called area fish and game warden out and she walked the area and observed all of the evidence on Sunday January 18th..","Canyon Lake near Startzville, Texas",Comal County,Texas,Winter,29.52533,-98.15854,1/9/15,47702,Class A,39.53,36.385,33.24,0.64,Overcast throughout the day.
"My son and I went trespassing up the Greenbelt Trail north of HWY 380, which has been closed for a couple years I believe due to flooding.

As we retreated back to the parking lot, I snapped several pictures aiming behind me over my shoulder. One of the pics may have caught something interesting?

"Had an awesome experience the weekend of July 26th 2019. While camping with my son and his 2 friends, at Eisenhower State Park, in Texas. We were sitting around the camp fire at night, about 9:15 pm, we all heard two howls south of our camp sight. Very deep howls, each lasting 5 to 7 seconds long each, with a small pause between. About 10 seconds later, another howl north west of camp. Higher pitch and feminine sounding. There are no Wolves or Coyotes in this area. Didn't sound like a dog or anything I've ever heard before. The boys, all over 18, were really excited and stood up looking around. They were not believers in Bigfoot, but that got them talking about the possibilities.  About 20 minutes later, while still sitting there, we heard a ""Whoop"" pretty close by. That was the point when they no longer thought i was just a weird Dad who believes in Bigfoot. Through out the night any sound we heard, we all discussed and scrutinized it. Best part of it all. I never spoke of Bigfoot until that point and they were the ones making the connection. The next morning we hiked all around the woods looking for any signs, but found nothing solid. It could have been something else, but from my experiences, it was real. Another big bonus for me is now my son is interested in going out with me, to research and hunt for of forest friend. I feel truly blessed that my son and I, were able to experience this together.

"Ok, this happened about 2 years ago or maybe 2 1/2. I live on 10 acres of woods. All around me is woods. I was just falling asleep during a cool summer night. The 3 dogs I have lived outside in their pen I built. The dogs bark now and then at night but usually quiet down, being that they are used to noises. They started barking that night so I sat up in bed and yelled ""no"". They stopped but after a few seconds they were barking very loud and unusual. I thought that it may have been a wild hog that we see every so often. I got up and heard some movement below my bedroom window, which is about 6 feet above the ground. I grabbed my 357 and stood up. I heard something like foot steps but they sounded like a very heavy person taking huge steps, but not running. I took off out the front door and turned the outside lights on with the dogs still barking wildly. I had a flashlight, pointed it where the steps were at, only to see nothing. But, I did smell a strong odor of a skunk but not that harsh smell. I laid back down a few minutes later and finally gathered my thoughts together and called 911. I was wondering how I was going to report this. I talked with the 911 operator and was kind nervous when talking with her. She laughed and said something like its OK, an officer will be there. I didn't want the officer coming to the house unless they were able to find something. No one came, so the next morning came I found myself looking for anything on the ground, no foot prints due to carpet grass that was pretty thick.

Then in the back of my head felt like someone was watching me.  Then we here 2 very distinct wood on wood knocks in front of us.  Then we heard 2 behind us.  Then 2 more in front of us.  I got up and knocked back and in the distance we heard another bigger one.  We also a bit later heard a single knock even closer behind us.

"This occurred after work. I stopped by the park on my way home to try out some new camping equipment.  There are two entrances to the park; the main entrance off of Hwy 16 and the one I like because it's more wooded off of Applewhite Rd. Some new trails are being made because of some flooding that occurred in the area last year so there are some trees that have been cut down. One of these trails has a wooden fence with a ""No Trespassing"" sign on it. I ignored the sign and made my way to the river. I made a small fire and began fishing. While I was fishing I started to hear loud banging. I turned around to see if i could see what was making the noise but saw no one. We do have Woodpeckers but this was no woodpecker. I thought nothing of it and continued fishing. A few minutes went by and I heard a loud moan. Like a wail. Again, I turned to look around and saw no one. I started thinking, ""Okay, someone has got to be messing with me."" I kept on fishing when out of the corner of my eye something moved and I heard a very loud splash. I did not see what was thrown into the water near me but it was big. A big rock or log is my guess. It made a giant ""SPLOOSH"". Something threw a BIG something in the water. After that I packed up and made my way back up to the trail. On my way back I heard the wood knocking again and I attempted to reply. I followed the three knocks I heard with three of my own. No reply. The whole time I walked back to my truck I had the feeling I was being watched. I stopped and looked around but saw no one. If someone was there they were well hidden and light on their feet because I didn't even hear footsteps. The area is wooded and there are leaves and branches everywhere so I'm sure I would have heard twigs snapping or leaves rustling if someone was there. When I got back to my truck I saw a jogger and his Lab going for a drink from the broken water fountain. I offered the man some bottled water for him and his dog. He thanked me and I took the opportunity to ask him if he had heard the same knocking or banging I had. He had. He said he and his dog stopped to listen but couldn't figure out where it was coming from. The road/highway divides the park. This man was on one side and I was on the other. This part of the highway doesn't get a lot of traffic so it wasn't traffic I heard. One more thing I think you should know is that this area has a legend called The Donkey Lady. All teenagers in San Antonio know of this legend. It is said if you cross her bridge you will hear her ""hooves"" pounding the road and things will be thrown at you. This legend has been around for many many years. After what happened yesterday,  I'm starting to think Donkey Lady Bridge isn't haunted by a ghost but occupied by something real. I'm not convinced Bigfoot exists because I need to see it but my wife believes and she suggested I report it to you guys. We often go hiking on these trails with our children and she likes to point out, facetiously, Bigfoot nests and food sources. We are an outdoorsy family and we live in the country where at night we hear owls and coyotes and know what predators and their prey live in our area and what noises they make.

"So I am an avid hunter and I used to hunt the Corps of Engineers land on the Texas side of the Red River. I was going to get my trail camera and check the pictures for any sign of wild hogs moving along the river and eating at the bait I had set up. When I pulled up to the parking area, I was the only truck there. It’s hot in the summer and in those woods there is little breeze. It’s about a 20 min walk through the woods to the camera. So I had navigated my way through the brush and had come around the old piece of original bridge supports and turned slightly north west and something yelled at me about 100 yards away, through the woods. It’s hard to describe the noise. It didn’t taper off, just a blast. I froze, and I don’t know why, but my instinct was to “whoop” at it. I “whooped” and it remained frozen too. I knew where it was but I couldn’t see it through the trees. I raised my rifle to locate whatever it was through the scope. I systematically started searching, and all of a sudden, it tore off through the woods. I saw a glimpse of it through the scope as it took off. What I saw is difficult to explain but you know how a skiers legs look them they are crouched, it was like that, like a spring compressing the knees to unleash power. The sun shone through the trees and I could see the legs had reddish brown fur but was shaggier than a deer. Almost like course hog hair but was soft. Everything about this makes me want to say it was a deer. The fur color, the legs bent, I would even entertain a deer having shaggier fur. But the yell is what makes me know it was something else. It’s yell was intimidating and demanding. It knew I was there and was letting me know it was there. After it ran off, I was filled with a sense of dread and had to talk myself out of not going back to the truck and leaving the camera.",You can park by the bridge crossing the Red River and walk down into the Corps of Engineers land.,Clay County,Texas,Summer,34.125,-98.105,7/30/18,63492,Class B,89.28,78.3,67.32,0.6,Rain in the morning.
"Not certain of the exact date of this occurrence, but I was lying in bed awake about 3am and was startled by what sounded like something pushing up against and rattling the vinyl siding on our house. This woke Lisa my wife up. I went outside with a flashlight but didn't see anything. We didn't think much of this at the time. Then we had two other occurrences within a two week time span. On Friday, November 16, around 6:15pm my wife and myself were almost home from our daily walk and while at the intersection of Northridge and Old Saltworks Rd., approximately 200 yards from our house we both heard and were surprised by a very loud, deep, guttural sound that was something between a growl and a roar. It only lasted for a couple of seconds. It was very voluminous and powerful. We just stopped and asked each other what on earth did we just hear. Then the incident that was the icing on the cake that made us come to this website and file this report, occurred on Friday, November 23 around 9pm. I shined a light behind our house to see if there were any deer out feeding. About 160 yards from our deck in a small patch of woods behind our house I saw two, large, brilliant, emerald green eyes, which were the shape of human eyes, but were about 7-8 inches apart. This freaked me out. I am an experienced outdoors-man and have logged several hundred days afield over the past 35 years. I have walked for hours by flashlight to get to hunting stands and have never ever seen eyes this shape and of this brilliance and set this far apart before. Before these occurrences I was very skeptical of all the Bigfoot stories and sightings I have seen or read about, but now I am open to the possibility that there is something out there that could fit the description of a Bigfoot. What we heard was very unique, and combined with the eye shine I saw, has changed my mind and opened me up to the possibility of a Sasquatch type creature lurking in the shadows.

"October 16, 2012, between 2 and 3 am.  My wife and I were on our Honeymoon in Linden, VA. We rented a cabin for the week. During the night, I woke up to a sound similar to what I thought was our dog dragging a suitcase across the hardwood floor.  But she was in fact, in bed with us, on point looking out the bedroom window. The draggin sounds were long footsteps coming from outside. We listened to them for about 20 seconds or so as they were getting closer.  A silhouette then quickly, but smoothly, passed right by the window.  We quietly listened until we could not hear anymore footsteps, and then talked about what it may have been for a little while until we decided to just go back to sleep (our dog ALWAYS growls and barks at people, but she didnt, so we figured it was just an animal, or a tree limb swinging past the window).  October 17th, 2012, 1pm.  We decided to take a walk on the Appalachain Trail being it runs just a couple hundred yards from the cabin.  About 35 minutes into the walk, we both heard the most bone chilling growl.  It was so low in tone that we actually felt it in our joints and ribcage.  it lasted a few seconds before we high tailed it out of there.  There was no way after hearing that, that I was going to stick around, unarmed, with my family.  The growl wasnt loud at all, it was just bone rattling deep.  Listened to hundreds of soundbytes of animals to compare to, but nothing came even halfway close to what this was.  Ive personally heard wild cats, dogs, and bear through years of hunting, but this was something almost out of this world sounding.

"My husband and I where sitting on the front porch one evening when what I thought was a bear caught my attention on the edge of the tree line.

The dark mass I thought was a bear then stood up and chased the deer into the woods. My husband and I looked at each other in disbelief at what we had just saw. It was too far away to get great detail of the animal but close enough to tell that it was very large and dark brown / black in color. After seeing it chase the deer on two legs back into the forest, I knew instantly that no bear could have ran so fast and so graceful on two legs.

"While on a training exercise in Ft. Pickett, VA., I was positioned in an observation point overlooking a camp. I was lying low in our hide providing over watch while my team member attempted to move in to within approximately 75 yards of this camp. It was at this point when three distinct knocking sounds spread no more than 1 second apart, were heard from our 6 o’clock position. The distance appeared to be within 100 yards. After a very short pause of about three, maybe five seconds, there was the sound of a large branch or small tree breaking in half. The noise was so loud that everyone in the camp grabbed their flashlights and searched the tree line towards the direction of the sound. We were almost compromised by this noise, but as quickly as the sounds were heard, the forest fell silent. Unfortunately, no one was able to further investigate those sounds due to our focus being the exercise and not the wild life. Approximately two, maybe three hours later, one of the cadre was listening to a range radio and overheard a conversation between an adjacent range and range control. The conversation spanned only a few minutes, but in summary it went like this: “Range Control, this is range #... umm, there is a Bigfoot walking across the range!” This range was only a few kilometers from our location. Early the next morning, maybe 5am, one of the members of our team had to depart the training environment so he was given a coordinate to meet for ex-filtration. He arrived early and waited until the extraction team arrived. During his time alone, he commented that he heard loud foot steps behind him. He was not sure if it was a large deer coming to investigate or what, but he said it came very close to him. So close that he was hearing this animal breathing behind him only a little ways off. He said he felt uneasy and didn’t dare turn around because his initial thought was that it might just be a buck that would become startled and attack him. A few moments later, the animal departed and shortly after he was extracted. He didn’t want to think of this animal as anything but perhaps a deer. After the exercise, we spoke with the role players about that night. They all heard the sound and thought one of us was trying to play a game with them or that one of us had fallen down the side of an embankment causing the loud noise. Once we advised them that it was not us, they just went silent and didn’t speak of it any further. The strange thing is that earlier that night I had this eerie feeling, like something was watching me from behind. My reaction at the time was to grasp my knife and prepare for whatever may come next. It never reached that point, but my senses were heightened and I found myself scanning my surroundings more often with my night vision. Due to the nature of my work, I cannot go into great detail as to the exact month or day, but I can mention that it was in the early months leading up to spring. But I cannot deny that there is something other than normal wild life in the woods surrounding Ft. Pickett, VA.

"It was in Christiansburg Virginia, just outside of town limits. We live on the edge of the wood line. There are several hundred acres back behind our house. We lease some of the property for hunting and riding our ATV's. It was mid day on a Sunday. Me and my husband were on his ATV going to check on a trail camera he had put out a couple days before. It takes a while to get to the location of the camera. The terrain is very unforgiving. We had stopped in the holler and the camera was on top of the ridge. My husband walked up to the camera to where I couldn't see or hear him anymore. I was sitting on the four wheeler in total silence. All of the sudden I heard this horn like yell. It sounded like a cross between a man yelling as loud as he could and a horn blowing. It wasn't extremely loud. I just sat there on the four wheeler. I couldn't process what I had just heard. I am constantly in the woods and have seen and heard every animal that is in these parts of the woods, and I've never heard anything like that before.

"At the time my unit was training in Ft. Pickett, VA.  We were conducting training for over a several day period.  The teams in the field kept asking if any other unit was training in the area because they could hear people walking nearby, but did not investigate so as not to give away their position, no other units were near.  One afternoon we distinctly heard several very loud knocks on a tree.  When asked, the field teams reported that they thought we were walking around and doing it.  We visually located each team and none were in the direction of the knocking.  Later that evening we heard a radio report of a ""bigfoot"" sighted on a range.",In a Fort Pickett southern training area.,Nottoway County,Virginia,Spring,37.047,-77.90815,1/16/12,31648,Class B,45.69,43.365,41.04,0.76,Mostly cloudy starting in the evening.
"It was last year (2019) around mid October near the Blue Ridge Parkway. Me and my boyfriend were working for the Roanoke Times delivering newspapers when this encounter happened.  We delivered anywhere from 12am-6am. We were almost done with the route when we went to turn down this dead end maintenance road since there was houses at the end of that who got the paper.  It was around 3:30-4am. While My boyfriend was going down the gravel end maintenance road the headlights caught a glimpse of this thing standing right at where the grass met the road. It stood about 7ft tall and it took off up the hill. It kinda walked fast, not necessarily ran. It was dark brown and had shaggy hair like fur. It was on 2 feet and walked like a human with its arms swaying back in forth right below the knees. I screamed out for my boyfriend to stop the car, but by time his reaction time kicked in whatever it was had already made it's way up the hill. My boyfriend positioned the car so the lights would shine up that hill and that's when we saw 2 bright glowing red/yellow eyes looking back at us. What was strange was it was hiding behind a huge tree and how high the eyes was up from the ground was close to 7ft tall. You could clearly see the eyes blink. We sat there for approximately 10 minutes and finally decided to finish up the route and come back. We did eventually come back after we got done with the last house and it was gone, but you could see where tree limbs and grass was pushed down from where it was standing on the side of the road. Maybe less then a month before we had that encounter we had heard tree knocks while on our route, from deep down in the woods maybe a neighborhood or two over.

My cousins and I were kayak fishing on Switzer Lake in Va.  We had been out for around an hour or so when we heard a knocking sound coming from the bank.  We paddled a little closer and it stopped.

"I was in the Shenandoah National Park, on Skyline Drive. I had stopped at one of two overlooks (they are only about 2.5 miles apart) in order to take photos of the sunset. The Park Service closes Skyline Dr. during the Virginia hunting season at 5:00 PM, so most of the visitors had already left. At a few minutes to five, as I was preparing to put my camera away, I was just standing, watching the changing sky. Downhill, and across an open area in front of the overlook, I heard two quick knocks come from the woods. About 30 seconds later, and several hundred yards to the right of the knocks, I heard one more come from the woods. About a minute later, two more knocks came from behind me, uphill and to my left.

"My two boys, ex-husband, and I were heading back to our hotel from dinner in Williamsburg, on the evening of October 22, 2020.  I took a left turn onto E Rochambeau Dr., which parallels interstate 64.  It was a clear night, dark and around 8:55pm.  I know that it was after 8:50 pm and before 9:00pm, because I was hoping to get back to watch the 9 pm debate. My son made a comment about my speed, and I pointed out a 55 mph speed limit sign, as we passed it.  I rounded a corner and saw a brief small glitter, which lead my eye to see movement.  I quickly could tell that it was an upright, bi-pedal figure.  As it walked quickly from right to left, I immediately could see that it walked like a human, but it was extremely broad and huge.  The arms and upper thighs were so big that I could see the outline of muscles.  The figure was blacker than black, almost looking like an enormous shadow figure, but solid.  My lights only revealed blackness, no clothes, just one solid figure.  I could see from the middle of the face and most of the legs.  I saw no features, as it was walking, only showing it's side to me.  It moved smoothly and quickly.  I could not see it's feet, or the top of the head. It happened so quickly that I didn't have time to say look, to my family who was with me.  As soon as it stepped of the side, I immediately said, ""What was that?!"".  I was curious to where it went, and as I passed the area, I could see that it went into the woods. There were no cars, people or anyone else on the road.  There was one house a little further down the road that had a front porch light on.  I keep trying to understand the distance from my car to the area it walked in the woods, trying to understand the height.  What I saw was huge, no way could any human be as huge, tall, and broad as this.  Again it was black, so black, and my lights didn't reveal details which is odd.  My children were completely freaked out, so I did not stop.

"It was dusk and I was walking one of my sister's dogs. It had been raining but wasn't at the time we were walking.

There is a thick wooded area on the right hand of the road. I heard something in the woods and thought maybe it was a deer or a dog. I kept running but the noise kept happening. It was like someone was in the woods just out of sight running in the leaves as I was running on the road. I would slow down and it would slow down. I would speed up and it would speed up.

There was a very large dog about 100 yards away over the ridge, that was frozen in place and staring in the direction of the sound.  There were 2 other dogs, one on a chain on the porch of a house and a hunting dog on a chain about 75 yards away from us.  Both of those dogs were frozen in place looking in the direction of the sound.  Not one of the dogs barked.  The hunting dog was the closest to the sound and it was still and quiet. My girlfriend said what do we do now?  Before those words were finished coming out of her mouth, I was trying to make the same sound back at whatever it was but I only did one guttural call instead of 3.  She said oh my God Ernie. It was quiet for 5 -10 seconds after my call and then it responded with another single call like I had just done. I thought I heard something moving. When it responded, a rooster crowed right behind us and then the rooster and chickens with it ran off the hillside behind us.  My girlfriend wanted to leave and go to my grandfathers and that sounded like a good Idea, however; I wanted to see if I could get close enough to see what it was. I convinced her we were safe in the car. So we got on the gravel road that went up to the water tank farther up the mountain, very close to where the sound had come from.  On the way up we  passed the dogs, They were standing still and looking up the mountain. When we got to the water tank I wanted to get out but my girlfriend asked me not to.  I listened to her and frankly happy that I did, since I didn't have anything for protection.  I had the windows down hoping to hear it again.  There was silence and then the dogs started barking at us.   That told me whatever had scared them must have been gone then, so we left.  The hunting dog that was standing still when we went passed it on the way up the hill was spinning around and flipping he was going so fast to try to get at our car. I didn't see anything but heard much.","Directions from Route 220. Cross the James River on James St. Take right onto route 43 (Church Street) into Eagle Rock.

"It was about 2 a.m. on or about May 3rd 2011, I heard a noise as if something fell that was heavy, a thud sound in the back of my house. I thought it might be a bear or burglar. Me and my 21 year old son went out to investigate. I was armed with a pistol and my son had a shotgun. I saw a deer run as if it was being chased. Then I saw a huge figure coming out of the woods. This thing was at least 8 feet tall. I could not believe this! I screamed out to this thing to stop. It came towards us running. I told my son to shoot. He shot in its direction. It then ran to my left flank and continued to come toward us. We ran back towards the house. I was in terror because the thing was shaped like a man but was covered with hair. I do not believe in Bigfoot but I cannot explain this? I stopped and watched it walk away into the light and it was huge and there was an odor that really stunk in the air. It stayed in sight for about 5 minutes before it went into the woods. I investigated the next day and there are footprints that are about 18 to 20 inches in the field. Unless this is a hoax and someone was in a costume? We fired on this thing and it made a huffing noise and a shriek sound. I have followed some the prints and there is long hair brown and gray back in the woods. I have had more noise and sightings in the woods behind my home. I live in the country and unless someone is doing this in a costume then this is the real bigfoot. There is also an underground tunnel dug into the side of a creek bed. The prints lead into the tunnel and I am not going in there.

"I was on my way back from Glenwood where my cousin had had a high school volleyball game; I and her older brother had hung around town well after the game so I left around midnight. On the way back I drove slower than normal because I didn't want to hit a deer with my car I had bought the previous month. I was a little more than two miles from the BZ corner junction when I saw a set of eyes reflecting on the opposite side of the road. I slowed down thinking it was a deer, however as I continued to approach I saw that they were sitting up pretty high. The road dips down on that side just as on mine, there are steep banks here and there. When it began to cross I was a little less than 10 yards from it but through the majority of the encounter I inched towards it to approximately 5/6 yards at the closest. When it came in to the shoulder of my headlights I noticed that the legs weren't thin like a deer or elk they were thick. I thought it might be a bear, however as it continued to cross I could tell it was way too big to be a bear sitting at roughly 7/8 foot high. I also knew it wasn't a bear because bears are meant to be on all fours it wouldn't have ""arms"" that came down about half way down the thigh (I could tell they came down that far because they swing slightly as it walked). When it crossed over the centerline for a moment it made about a quarter turn with its torso and looked at me briefly before turning back (all as it was walking, it didn't stop at any time while on the road). I don't recall much of the face but what I do clearly remember was noticing the shape of the head was not at all like a bear, more like a tall bump off of massive shoulders and that there was no snout (that part I noticed as it finished looking away from me). It continued to walk forward in to a ditch along the road with a steep bank (as it did so walking a little bit towards my car as if trying to step out of the light). It awkwardly turned away and I started driving forward slowly. I ended up crossing halfway into the other lane but I would estimate its distance to the side of my car as I began to pass would have been 3/4 feet at the closest. Once I was pretty sure I had passed it I sped up. I never looked in the rear view mirror, I was honestly too afraid too. The hairs were standing on the back of my neck the rest of the drive. I knew it was watching me as I drove away and the scariest part was I knew it was watching me when I was unable to see it after I passed.",This happened while I was traveling South West on the BZ Glenwood Highway 2 miles from the BZ junction on to HWY 141.,Klickitat County,Washington,Fall,45.86883,-121.4813,9/15/10,35479,Class A,71.01,64.315,57.62,0.27,Mostly cloudy starting in the evening.

"Live pretty far into the foothills of the cascades near Cinebar, WA. Had a camera (Astak Mole) out on my back porch to capture animals in my yard (for fun in the summer - we see Deer frequently and Bear occasionally). I was laying in bed listening to the audio through the camera (it has a pretty sensitive mic) and heard some odd ""wooping"" in the distance. Luckily a moth or something set the camera off and it recorded two of them. I think I heard about 4 total - two are on the video file I have and will mail it to you. They sound like they're loud but distant (resonates off the hills a bit it sounds like). This was Aug. 27, 2011 at 11:41 PM. Sunday morning, January 22, 2012 got up and looked out my bedroom window to look at the snow (we had almost 2 feet total but it had been raining for days so it was dwindling).  The tracks were starting to really show up as the snow melted - noticed my ATV tracks through the back yard from Monday or so, several sets of footprints from my son and dog, then an odd ""dotted line"" set in between all of them.  Took a picture from my window, went to church, then came back and took more close up shots and measured the distance between the ""steps"" which were between 5 and 6 feet consistently.  They were in a straight line going from one tree in the back of my yard directly to a large tree in the middle of the yard (not around it, but directly to it which I thought was weird) then a set of prints turn right and head to another tree at my property line with my neighbor to the East and don't know where from there.  I also couldn't track the steps out the back of the property - the snow was melted a lot more and there was no obvious direction.  There's a private dirt road behind my property and on the other side of that, acres of trees. On January 27, wondering if this is some frequent path I set up a trail cam on the path and captured what sounds to me like walking up to the camera (the IR's didn't fire due to low battery I think) but the picture's black - but you can take a listen and see what you think...not conclusive, but interesting I think anyway.

"June 2nd saturday my Mom & I wanted to go back to a place that she had done a BFRO expedtion. She said it had been pretty active,& she wanted to show me around in the day light hours.We met 2 of her Big footer friends on the way down. They drove their own jeep. We were going to the last spot that my mom wanted to show me.She said that it was the one spot that she had got creeped out while on the expedition at night. She also wanted to see this road going down to a clearing in the day time. Just after we had gotten to the spot that she was talking about,we heard a really weird loud whistle-whine-gurgling sound in the brush off to the right of us about 60 feet from us. I was ahead of my Mom by 10 feet or so. We stopped because it surprised us & held real still. The sound stopped....we started to walk again & the sound was louder & got more strange.Like a wild pig that was whisteling under water this time.There were also 3 loud human whistles from the other side of the road, up the hill & father away.I wanted to see what was making this sound & was hoping it was a bigfoot!I went closer to the pig sound & my Mom yelled at me to get back to her.2 trees were shaking now around the pig sound in the bushes.My Mom's friends were driving down with thier jeep to meet us & my Mom was flagging them down.I really really HAD to see what it was ,so I ran to the sound.My Mom was really scared & mad at me. But I am glad that I went to the noises, because I got to see what was making it.When I yelled at my Mom that I was looking right at a little Bigfoot,It stopped making the sounds, let go of the trees & turned around(away from me)I think it hit 2 trees with it's hands or fists on the way,because there were 2 very very loud thuds & the trees shook.It moved really fast into the under growth & it looked like it got down on all fours as it ran away very fast & made all kinds of crashing sounds. The whisteling on the other side of the road started again & the friends of my Mom's got to hear it too.After it ran away all noises stopped & it was dead silent.",Location is private,Lewis County,Washington,Spring,46.53686,-122.202,6/2/12,35812,Class A,55.02,48.765,42.51,0.44,Clear throughout the day.
"On Sunday June 2, 2013, a friend of mine at the time wanted to explore some logging roads in our area and get some pictures of his jeep in action. We started out exploring many of the roads in the area, and as we travelled down one road we encountered a tree that had fallen across the road but was lodged in the trees tops on the other side of the road. We were able to drive under it after we determined that it seemed safe from falling and blocking us in. We drove a short distance further and went through a sharp right turn and found another tree across the road the same way. So we decided to back up a few feet and take a smaller side road and turn around. Once we were on the side road we decide it may be a good road to check out, however we wanted to walk up the road to make sure we could turn around, or see if we could tell how far up it went. The road was smaller than the previous we were on, and neither of us had any previous knowledge of this area. After we got out of the jeep we walked about ten feet and heard a few quick knocks which sounded like a big stick hitting a tree, almost like someone knocking on a door. We continued walking and while talking about the noise, we then became distracted by some old broken equipment that was left by the loggers. We thought it was odd that it was left because it had some scap metal value. At that time we again heard the knock behind us, and on the same side of the road as before. At that point I took a couple of pictures toward the noise, but while looking at the display screen on the camera I was using (Canon PowerShot A720 IS) I did not see anything. As our attention was focused on that area and we moved closer, we heard another sound to the left of us also on the same side of the road. It was a massive snap that sounded like at least a 6 inch thick log breaking. It was not just a quick snap, we could hear the log snapping in sections like when you cut down a tree. At that point we decided that we needed to leave and walked back to the jeep trying not to look like we were fleeing. At that point we backtracked up the hill on the road we came in on and looked down on the area. But we could not see any people, car, or anything else that could have made the noise.","The area was north of Rooster Rock, Google earth gave the coordinates as: (edited-out to protect the exact location)",Lewis County,Washington,Summer,46.64191,-122.4607,6/2/13,48797,Class B,59.12,48.385,37.65,0.82,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.
"Using my car as a blind. I used a game call, sounding like a squealing rabbit. I tried not to move while sitting in my car. Then, in my middle rear view mirror, I saw a sasquatch peak around a tree about 60 feet away. It watched me for about 30 seconds, then very slowly walked to another tree about 20 feet away from the first tree. Then again, it watched my car for about 30 seconds. Because of the back tinted window, the reflection, the shady light, and my high headrests I don't think it could see me. I could not see face details. When it walked, it kept it's arms at it's side. I saw it from the waist up. I never felt fear. I hoped it would come closer. Then, it must have gotten down on all fours and crept away. Didn't see it again.

"Over the Labor Day weekend 2010 my girlfriend and Newfoundland dog were camping at Lake Cushman, WA at the upper Camp Cushman campsite.  We had dinner, an evening walk and then to bed in our seperate tents.  I was cuddled up with my dog when all of a sudden a very loud earie whooping call burst through the quiet night, awaking me and the dog.  My dog growled and flipped himself over & broke the tent pole. He was very agitated, nervous and couldn't calm down. The whoop sounded longing, lonely or lost in tone.  It was definatly a female tone, the whoops went ""whooop whooop whoop, whoop whoooop.."" then would stop for about 15-20min, then again ""whooop whoooop...."" on and on for about 2.5 - 3hrs.  The noise came from up above the campsite away from the Lake.  It sounded really close but could tell it was far away, perhaps about 1- 2 blocks away.  It was difficult to tell due to the woods, lake and projection of the very loud voice.  I thought it could be an owl but no owl sounds like that, then I thought maybe an Elk but once again I've never heard an elk like this before. I couldn't go to sleep that night due to my dog wouldn't calm down, he was on alert all night until it finally stopped. I was petrified and was up all night wondering if this creature making the noise was coming to visit us in our tents. When I woke up my friend had heard the same noise and wondered if it was an injured dog howling but then when I mentioned sasquatch whoops she had an Ah-hah moment and realized no dog could make this noise. Others campers gathered in the AM discussing the mysterious noise, some said it was a bard owl, spotted owl, a coyote, an elk, but I felt in my bones it was the same noise I had heard from a recording on BFRO site (1974 Ron Morehead Sierra Nevada whoops & knocks) Camp Cushman is most likely being closed due to some lawsuit w/the native americans over land use.","Lake Cushman ( Camp Cushman campgrounds, the upper campsites)",Mason County,Washington,Summer,47.46872,-123.2259,9/4/10,28207,Class B,63.67,55.115,46.56,0.86,Mostly cloudy until evening.
"One summer night in 2008, I was sitting on the back deck with our dog Icy at about 1 in the morning, because it was too hot to sleep. It was totally silent -- which it normally is around here at night -- and as I sat there on the wooden steps, with Icy sitting on the deck about 3 feet away from me, I heard what at first sounded like a distant siren, seemingly from the north-north-east. (The only thing in that direction from our house is Dow Mountain, with no roads except for dirt logging roads).  Icy's response to sirens is invariably the same: he lifts up his head, pricks his ears, listens intently, and then begins howling, usually in the moment just after the siren becomes inaudible to my human ears. That night, though, his response was completely different. He came quickly to my side and pressed himself against me, sort of hunching himself into an extension of my body. As I listened, I viscerally ""knew"" that what I was hearing was NOT a siren, although it did seem very, very similar to a siren sound.  I remember I was holding my breath -- and my impression was that I didn't start breathing again until the sound had completely stopped -- and I can only hold my breath for about 50 seconds, so that's the amount of time I would guess the sound went on.  The same instinct that told me that I was not listening to a siren also told me that I had never heard this sound before.  Another -- to me -- validating aspect was that my own response to it was out of character, just as Icy's was. Normally I would have sat there for another hour or so, hoping to hear it again. It was so amazing -- and I usually can't get enough of that kind of interesting mysterious stuff. But when the howling ended and I started breathing again, my first impulse was to get inside the house, quietly and fast.  I went online and Googled every kind of indigenous Pacific Northwest animal I could think of: elk, fox, coyote, deer, bear, rabbit, moose, cougar, various owls, other birds -- even wolf, which we purportedly do not have in this area -- and couldn't find any WAV file that even came close. On a chance, I looked up Sasquatch WAV files, and listened to the ones that I could find -- I think there were five -- and one of them, the ""Ohio Howl"", was a dead ringer. When I heard it coming through the headphones, chills started running up my back. That was the sound I'd heard.","Approximately 300 feet from Highway 119, and approximately 1.5 miles northwest of the Foothills Park area.",Mason County,Washington,Summer,47.41995,-123.2005,1/11/11,28487,Class B,33.99,31.925,29.86,0.23,Foggy starting in the evening.
"On Friday the 5th of November 2010, my family and I decided to go hiking near Lake Cushman. I typically go hiking alone as it gives me opportunity to gather my thoughts and enjoy the outdoors. Seeing as how my wife’s birthday was coming up she managed to convince me to take her and our two children along. I had planned a more arduous hike near Mt. St. Helens but given the children’s notable lack of ambition and current weather conditions I elected to drive the hour and a half from our home in Castle Rock to Lake Cushman for a more “family friendly” outdoor experience.  We arrived at the Big Creek trail near Hoodsport at around 1000 hours and began our hike (trail 827.1 loop). It was a cool day with a light drizzle and visibility was at times no more than 75-100 yards. The hike was rather uneventful and my wife and I both noted that the utter silence of the forest that day was deafening. There was one other car at the entrance to the park so I just assumed they had gone in ahead of us on the same path and had ruined our chances of viewing any wildlife. At around 1130 hours I heard a truck about 75 yards up the ridge. I looked up just in time to see the cab lights of a logging truck heading up the mountain on road 2419. About 10 to 15 minutes later I heard what I initially thought was another vehicle struggling to climb the road. A couple of seconds later I realized it wasn’t a car at all but an animal or possibly another person. It sounded like part howl and part groan. It was difficult to describe other than to say it seemed mournful. This groan/howl lasted about 8-10 seconds during which time I turned to look at my wife and children. The look on their faces said it all. They had heard it as well. Almost simultaneously everyone said “what was that”. I said I had no idea and we continued on. At around 1200 hours we approached the Skinwood Creek Bridge. All at once we were stopped dead in our tracks by a horrible odor, which I can only describe as a cross between skunk and ammonia. The odor was so heavy we could taste it and our eyes even began to water a bit. My daughter began to cry and repeatedly begged me to let us return to the truck. I must confess I would have liked to oblige but we were at the half way point and continuing forward seemed to be the most logical course of action. As we continued on the odor dissipated. We made the turn at the bridge and started back down the trail on the west side. At almost the same point we encountered the odor on the east side of the trail we picked up the scent again on the west side. We continued down the trail and once again the odor dissipated. The remainder of the hike was uneventful and I dare say we made much better time heading back to the truck.",Olympic National Forest just East of the Mount Skokomish Wilderness on Big Creek Trail 827.1,Mason County,Washington,Fall,47.29435,-123.1267,1/25/11,28485,Class B,47.93,43.045,38.16,0.72,Foggy overnight.
"January 15, 2014 approximately 5:30 pm. I had been burning yard debris on the back of our property, east of Shelton, Wa.  We have a horse training facility on 6 acres backed up to a densely wooded hillside with a wetland on the southeast corner of our property. My burn pile was just west of the wetland area.  After I had fed the horses and closed up the barn I went to tend to the fire as I was standing there is when I heard a call, the closest thing I can compare it to is a howler monkey/ whooping crane mix type call with a low (almost subsonic) growl or rumble that was mostly felt, not audible.  The first call I didn't quite pay attention to, however the second call made my hair stand on end, and it was close (I would guesstimate within 100 yards). It was dark and because of the fire all I could see in that direction was darkness but I felt that I was being watched and possibly being called to. The call was not strained as in trying to carry distance but just to be heard.  I was frozen for a moment then I turned and quickly headed to the house when I heard the call one more time.

"Awaken at 3:00-3:30 AM to the most cerebral frightening howl or roar I've ever witnessed. Sounded like the combination of a Howler Monkey and Bear's death moan. It sat us both up and my girlfriend who's a Wildlife Biologist and lived in the Yukon immediately asked me what was that.? I responded that I've never heard anything like it and initially said a howler monkey escaped from the zoo. It was long increasing howls that were felt as well as heard and had a tone and character almost primal in nature. They continued for 10 minutes at 2 to 3 minute intervals lasting 10 seconds I'm guessing. We both backcountry camped Glacier NP the Yukon and Denali and have never in our 30yrs of Wilderness exploration heard anything like this. I stayed awake until sunrise than slept until noon. Returning home we searched databases on North American mammals sound archives and found nothing like this. We found what we heard exactly under a Google search that played Sasquatch Vocalizations and decided we should at least report it.

"On Wed. 8/17/11 my family went camping in Okanogan County, Washington near the town of Conconully, WA. We arrived around 4:00 p.m. at the Salmon Meadows campsite. We checked out serveral sites and picked the one nearest the meadows, we were the only ones at this campsite. We went for a hike and got back to the campsite. There were numerous range cattle in our area. After hanging out at our site we heard a strange howl yell down in the creek bed the sound repeated 2 or 3 times, we were about 40 feet above the creek bed, we went down to take a look, we thought that an animal had injured itself. We found a young cow on the other side of the cattle guard. We opened the barb wire fence and tried to herd it to the other side, but it wouldn't go. We put the fence back up and went back to our camp. That night I woke up many times, thought I heard something and tried to see if anything was there in the full moon light illuminated meadows and forests. Our dog didn't react so I fell back to sleep hoping for morning. We woke up to some howls down in the creek bed below us. We had a video camera and tried to catch some of the howls on tape. We got 5 clips with the howls as they moved further away. I will email the best one after I submit this report. We tried to follow the sound away from us but it moved too fast, and our son was still sleeping in our campervan. We went back to camp and didn't hear or see anything else. We went to a bakery in Okanogan, WA and told of our experience and explained where we camped and all three people working said they had heard of this kind of activity around where we were. I have spent a lot of time in the woods and wild places, don't hunt or fish, and have never heard this kind of sound before. When we got home I sat down and wrote down a more detailed account, feeling like this was something significant.","Easy to find at the top of the road from Conconully, WA heading west.

"What happened to me occurred at my favorite fishing spot on the upper Conconully Lake near the town of Conconully Washington in Okanogan County. The incidents I am about to tell you about happened on 3 separate visits to this spot but they were in a row. The first time I was fishing and had been there a a couple of hours when across the lake I heard several knocks on trees. I looked for up towards the area they had came from and saw nothing.  The hill side has a lot of trees on it and is very steep and no roads on that side of the lake.  On my next trip to same location had again been there for a couple of hours when I heard a big splash from a very big rock landing in the lake several feet out in the water.  The rock came from the same area I had heard the knocking on my previous trip.  I looked the area over to see if I could see where it had come from and if anyone or thing was in the area. I could not determine where it had come from but it had to come from up the side of the hill.  I could see no one or anything else in the area.  I thought to myself that maybe a bigfoot could have tossed it into the lake cause I could not see any man doing it, as it was just too big a rock and it was thrown too far out into the lake.  On my third trip back to the same location my son Robby was with me.  I had told him of my last two visits to the location and what I had heard and saw.  We spent the afternoon there fishing without incident and were packing on our gear to leave when we both heard up behind us, rocks come rolling and the sounds of something very big moving across the hill side above us. It made both of us a little unnerved.  We did not see anything but it was not something we had heard before. It was not a deer as I have seen them in the area before and they had not had any trouble with the terrain and it could have been a bear but I have not seen any bear in that area before. What ever it was that caused the rocks to slide was big and moving at a pretty good pace. It was too far up the hillside for us to see.  Each time I was there the weather was fine and it was in the early spring. It is a great place to fish and I will continue to go there. I haven't heard of anyone else having any incidents like mine before and I have been back to same location many times since without any more incidents like I have just told you about.",,Okanogan County,Washington,Spring,48.57806,-119.6985,5/2/12,39610,Class B,53.02,45.695,38.37,0.37,Mostly cloudy until evening.
"Went hiking this last Sunday 10/19/2014 and parked off Service road 4235 off Hwy 20 on the Loup Loup Pass. Left my car about 0700 and crossed over a dirt berm that had been pushed up blocking another service road. Thought it would be as good a place to do some research on a book that my son is encouraging me to write. Had hiked about 1000 feet when I spotted what appeared to be deer tracks heading over the road and down into the ravine, took a few photos and went down into the ravine. About 200 feet down I lost the tracks and noticed my battery on my camera was almost dead, searched my pack, like a dummy I had left it back in my camera bag in the car. As I started back up in the direction of the car I heard 2 loud wacks of wood on wood about 6 or 7 seconds apart and about 300 feet above and to the right of me. Thought maybe hunters but had seen no signs of campers, no sounds of vehicles or rifle reports. Reached my car and got the camera battery and was ready to hike back out when I noticed that at the opposite end of the berm about 10 feet from where I had crossed earlier that some thing had crossed it and had slipped. I got a little excited thinking maybe a deer and a possible good track. What I found set me back a bit and had me starring for a bit. I have been all over the Cascades, Olympics and have been from Compo to Monument 78 on the Pacific Crest trail four times. Have heard a lot of strange and different sounds and have later been able to say bird, Wolf,Cougar, Bear, Elk, etc. This I don't know. If it was human, as an Investigator and Fugitive recovery agent it would not be someone I would take down. If it is an animal, it is one I have never seen or seen tracks of personally. After several moments the Investigator in me kicked in and I photographed the prints I found and cast the one that appeared the best defined. Not sure how the cast will turn out being on a slope and not having any ring to assist in the casting. While the cast set up I searched about for other tracks but the ground was very firm everywhere except around that berm. Collected the cast after 45 Min's and decided I would try to look for my tracks elsewhere. I know that it was hunting season, but had seen no one camping heard no sounds of vehicles or rifle reports from hunters that morning or for the rest of the day in that area.","Off hwy 20 at the snow park area go about 5 miles to service road 4235, go about 2 to 3 miles on left there is a dirt berm with a barrel like piece of concrete at the end of the berm and your there",Okanogan County,Washington,Fall,48.44425,-119.9417,10/19/14,46809,Class B,55.93,46.955,37.98,0.87,Overcast in the morning.
"My son and I are fans of the show ""Finding Bigfoot"". He is 11 and I'm 43 years of age, he's a believer and I am not. It is an interesting topic but I'm a see it to believe it type of guy. We just got back from a 3 day Memorial Day weekend in Tonasket Washington. A friend has property there and invited us out. I thought for the fun of it I would take the boys (4 of them) ages 11, 13, 15 and 18 out to a dark and scary place to have fun and do some so called ""knocks"" and ""squatch"" calls... Well let me tell you my friends what ever it was either animals or what might ya... It is very active out there and the sounds scared the crap out of me...... We didn't see anything at all but we all heard many things loud and clear! I'm not easily scared I'm 6ft 6 inches and 255 lbs... And I was carrying my 9mm with me.. But this got my attention. Just thought I would drop a line on what we heard might interest you guys. We heard back on ""knocks"" , ""squatch"" calls (adult and young) and even heard a tree breaking.

"I am a huge bigfooter, and I went on a night investigation right on the border of Lost River in the Methow Valley. My dad and I crossed the river a little after nine and started to go West. We did a few tree knocks and nothing was heard or seen. We decided to backtrack and go East for about half a mile. We kept doing tree knocks and still nothing. I began to feel an incredibly unsettling feeling, sort of like severe anxiety. I belted out a call, specifically a call thought to have come from child sasquatches. Around 7-10 seconds later I heard what sounded like a really heavy rock clunking against a tree. My dad and I became quite excited, so I tried a couple whoops and got nothing. We decided to call it a night and headed home at around ten pmish.","Go off highway 20 into Mazama, go west about six miles up lost river road.

"We were there @8 days. First two days & nights were fine. After that we started hearing what sounded like a lady moaning or ""howling"" across the field. Also tree knocks in the far tree line across the field. It seemed like it would happen in one spot & then another would respond in another area. The next couple nights it seemed to get closer until it sounded like it was in the woods right behind our tent. (Very loud knocks, usually 2 at a time.) Also got growled at 4 times from right outside the tent one night maybe @ the sixth night. We stormed out of tent with guns & flashlights & didn't see anything & didn't hear anything running away! Also during the day after hunting we came back to find a smaller tree with full fresh rootball placed across the entrance to our camp site. (It wasn't dragged there, there was no dirt drag marks anywhere & we looked around & couldn't find where it was pulled from. There were also some other big limbs placed there too. (I have pics of the tree.). Keep in mind there was no other campers or hunters in the whole valley the whole week.) The last night we came back to camp and a large healthy green pine tree was pushed over in the woods & landed right in the middle of our camp. This was the last straw for us, we couldn't take the stress anymore & needed sleep. We left camp and drove to my families cabin at Priest Lake & slept there. My buddy left the lantern on in the tent before we left and when we came back the next morning the tent zipped was unzipped about 6-7 inches & we had zipped it up tight.

"I had become aware of bigfoot in the Northwest during 2018 and started paying more attention to some odd things I would see. The area my boyfriend's cabin is at is near Caldwell Lake, WA. The main thing I want to tell you was that Dec. 2018 we were snowmobiling during a very cold snowy day out Dry Canyon Road...very primitive area...a few people have cabins in the area and people hunt this area but we are about the only people snowmobiling this road. As we ride our sleds we stop to take breaks and enjoy the beauty. We had stopped a few times, taken our helmets off to rest and enjoy the beauty. When we got to the big caves and stopped, my boyfriend said,""Listen"" and there it was...wood knocking. We would here it down the road a bit, up the mountain and then you would here a response from across the road where a creek flows and it is dense brush, maybe a hunting trail. We were sure it was not trees creaking from the weight of the snow...We had not heard this sound. I got really full of anxiety and wanted to leave so we did.

"Myself and my 7 year old grand daughter were out checking out some of the reported sigthings in the pierce county area.These sightings were a couple years old. The report #20591 is the site where we encountered vocals if thats what you want to call it, I call it a bunch of screaming. Anyway, we turned right at the first baptist church and went down this gravel pot holed road, we went as far as we could which was 1/2 mile maybe. the road is blocked off by giant rocks so we parked there got out walked straight down the road followed it for an hour or so anyway we seen a not trespassing sign posted up in a tree we were trying to make it to the river guess u cant get there anymore. we did see a green van parked down the road also, so we headed back to the truck. after getting back to the truck I was thinking about leaving the area but noticed another road across this small creek that ran along side of the road rite where the truck was parked. we crossed it went threw the area where the big pipes are and turn right followed the road which turns in to a path i'd call it anyway we got about 100 feet, i heard what i thought was a gruggling sound i stopped and i also noticed i did hear birds everything went dead quiet then I heard a faint little whine. Then the screaming started behind us. from where we came from on top of the hill to the left of where we came down the path about 50 yards back in dense brush area. something was screaming then I heard another something start screaming i thought OMG!! their are two holy crap!! we tried to quietly make our way back to the top of the hill, at the same time i could hear them moving towards us through the brush and they were still screaming I had positioned myself above the area i thought I could get a good picture of them if they came out of the brush into this small clearing it was perfect wind was towards us so i know they didnt get wind of us. we hiding behind a tree. My grand daughter was really getting scared at this point and made noise and they went quiet stopped and i heard them move away from us threw the brush on to the road to our left and they disappeared, gone that quick i searched the area where i thought they were for prints nothing but smashed down grass and some broken branches.

"Went out near Nisqually River with dog to build camp fire and enjoy nice night weather alone. In a remote spot on the river on Joint Base Lewis McCord I was with my dog Oscar. The fire had just started to catch up and my dog started barking toward the river ferociously. This is very out of character for him. I told him to be quiet and come back to me. I then heard large rocks being thrown into the river. I went to inspect with my flashlight and saw nothing. They were large rocks because I could hear them hitting the rocks on the bottom of the river. There were more than 5 rocks thrown. The experience was so creepy that I immediately put my dog in my Jeep and left. I am an avid outdoorsman and notice details always, on the way in I observed that no one had been in the area since the last rain because there were no tracks. In this area there is no access to the other side of the river other than walking in. I observed no evidence of other humans such as lights, fire, or sounds.

"Personal information edited out by the investigator to protect the privacy of the witness.  Names have been changed to initials.  Timeframe:  The following series of incidents occurred starting in April of 2012.  Possibly as early as April / May of 2011. Private, full-time residence and immediate surrounding area.   Rural.  Heavily wooded rugged terrain, south-west of Mount Rainier National Park.   There is nothing behind (north) of this location for many miles. There are numerous logging roads thru this area both maintained and old.  Many drainages, streams and game trails  There are no homes or residents throughout the area north of us.  It is mountainous and wild. Wildlife:  Large deer and elk population, bear, cougar, owl, fox… all seen on the property.  If it is native to this immediate area, it’s likely here. Incident Descriptions: April 27, 2012 -  Witnesses: PC and neighbor FP. Around noon on the 27th both witnesses heard exceptionally loud and continuous screams for approximately twenty minutes moving from east to west in the tree-line to the south of their homes as though something was “being chased” and “in fear of its life”.  Both witness’s are in their eighties.  PC grew up in the area and returned here to live 2.5 years ago.  FP has lived in the area for over twenty-seven years.  Both are familiar with the sounds of wildlife in the area and both state that they “have never heard anything like this before”.  The screaming was described as human like, but not human.  Moving rapidly as though being chased.  The sound “went through them” and “scared the life out of” them.  When asked why they didn’t call 911 they both said that they should have, but did not know what or how to report what they were hearing and thought they would be “laughed at”.   I (LC, PC's son) was out of town during this incident, but it was reported to me by my mother during a phone call that same day.  During that call I told her that both FP and her had likely heard some elk running through the woods. May 18/19, 2012 – Witness LC (reporting source).  I had just returned home from playing hockey in Seattle and was unloading the car behind my house at 3am.  I felt I was being watched.  It was pitch black out and the Baard Owls were going crazy all around the house.  Then the owls stopped like a switch had been  thrown.  After a brief pause something yelled at me from about 100 to 150 yards away (?) in the woods… somewhere between me and the stream behind us anyway.  I have never heard anything like this in my life.  It was human like, but not human.  The sound went right through me.  It felt like a less than lethal crowd control weapon (I spent 25 years in the military / civil service with multiple overseas tours and had been exposed to these).  The hair on my body stood straight up, I felt chilled and distinctly “warned off”.  I left my hockey sticks in the car (anyone who knows me knows that I do not leave my sticks anywhere!) and went strait inside the house.  I told J (my fiancé) that “I was done… something just yelled at me out there” and called it a night.  The next afternoon my mother, PC, asked if I heard that thing outside last night.  I told her yes and she said that was exactly what she and FP had heard for twenty minutes a few weeks before.  It was not any animal that I have heard before and I’ve heard weird owl calls, strange cougar sounds, fox etc.  This was at a volume and resonance that was off the chart.  I could literally feel the sound pass thru me.  For the next few weeks while out back, I was feeling watched…  not all the time, but frequently. May 28/29, 2012 approx. 11pm to 2am – While laying in bed I could hear a faint sound like what was heard earlier in the month.  It sounded as if it was on or near a ridgeline to the north of the house.  Around 2am J said she heard it too and it was “really weird”. Aug 12, 2012 – I was mowing the lawn in the back (north) of the house when I hit a rock with the lawnmower.  I still have the bruises from where the rock hit my leg as I write this.  Aside from being injured, I was annoyed that there was a rock in that portion of the yard as I had been continuously clearing the area of rocks for quite a few weeks and had that specific area clean.  As I looked around the area I found that there wasn’t just one rock, but nearly a hundred rocks all about fist sized laying around the area, about five to fifteen feet from the wood-line.  There are no kids in the area and I do not know of any animals that distribute rocks on the ground as if thrown. Aug 19, 2012 – While visiting with GJ and TJ, a part-time neighbor who has a cabin approx. ¼ mile to the east of us I asked “have you heard the screaming man?”  When I asked this GJ turned almost white.  He said that both he and his wife TJ had in-fact heard what I was describing “a few months ago like May, maybe”.  They said they had not reported it because they had “no idea of what it was”, but that it had scared them too. Note:  I have been hesitant to write this report, but was convinced to do so by this final report from GJ and TJ.  I started this report by indicating a possible 2011 event.  This occurred from Late April to mid-June of 2011, so the same approx. timeframe of these recent incidents, though separated by one year.  All I can say is that both J and I heard “talking” between what sounded to be a male and female human back in the woods on multiple nights (after midnight usually).  This was strange as there is nothing back there.  But we both remember hearing only “mumbling”, no clear speech.  But that mumbling had to have carried for at least a hundred yards –plus for us to have heard it.  I wrote it off at the time as potentially game control officers looking for poachers.  But looking back now I also considered it very strange. If nothing else, I hope this report adds a few more data points to your efforts.  There have been multiple events in this area over the years, but people are very reluctant to discuss them.  You can feel free to contact me and I have the permission of all reporting sources to include their names in this report.  They have also indicated a willingness to share their stories with any follow-on investigation of this report.",5 miles outside the main entrance to Mount Rainier National Park.,Pierce County,Washington,Spring,46.75953,-122.0246,5/18/12,36310,Class B,57.25,45.165,33.08,0.93,Mostly cloudy until afternoon.
"In June of 2012 my son woke me up at approximately 3 am telling me that he heard whispering somewhere around the house. I told him to go back to bed because he was dreaming. within minutes I heard the whispering as well. I grabbed a flashlight and left my bedroom which is on the second floor of my house. My son immediately asked me if I heard the whispering as well. The ""whispering"" sounded like someone was whispering loudly and it sounded like a foreign language or gibberish of some sort. I first thought that is was outside in my back yard but wanted to clear my house first to be sure someone wasn't in my home. shortly after looking around my house I the whispering stopped. five or six days later  on July 4th I was in my back yard getting ready to cut the grass when I noticed the area of my yard where the grass was higher was trampled down and there was a feces pile in the grass. I have seen scat from most all of the animals in my area and this didn't appear to come from any of them. It was very large, black and looked like it came from a human. my first thought was that someone took a crap in my yard. I then called my son to come take a look and he reminded me of the whispering that had taken place days earlier. I was watching finding bigfoot one evening and I heard Bobo talking about squatch's speaking gibberish and it immediately made me think of that incident. April of 2015 my dog woke me up wanting to go out side to go potty at around 2-3 am. while outside i heard what sounded like a baseball bat or something striking a tree two times in the wooded area to the east across the road from my house. this past May my daughter and her boyfriend also experienced something strange while walking a trail  to my house. I wont post it here as it is her story and I don't want to speak for her on record but am happy to provide the story verbally.",,Pierce County,Washington,Summer,47.09982,-122.6246,6/1/12,50160,Class B,66.54,60.02,53.5,0.4,Light rain in the morning.
"OK, last night I went home from Walmart in Spanaway Washington, and I turned left onto 8th Ave E, which goes from Spanaway highway 7 which is Pacific Avenue also. This street turns into a two lane country road that makes one of the borders of Joint base Lewis-McChord. It is a long dark two lane country road that bisects a huge prairie with lots of old growth woodlands bordering it. I drove home the back way again tonight hoping to pinpoint the exact location for you, but there are no mile markers nearby where I seen what I saw. The best I can do, is it is Approximately 4-5 miles out from town, the road is largely flat and straight, but there are a few rises as you drive. The place I was at was about 3-400 ft from the second place where there is a rise in the road. I know this because I could see the creature with a hill in the background and some trees, and when we drove up through there tonight there was no place else that fit those two things. First off, it was very dark, and oddly devoid of cars, as there is usually someone flashing their lights at me as my car has a headlight out and I have been driving with my brights on until payday to get it fixed. I think if I had not had my brights on, I would never have seen this creature. At any rate, suddenly I seen the Patterson Film in real life, about 400 ft down the road ahead of me. The creature I saw fit the same color scheme of Harry and the Hendersons, but in behavior it was nearly identical to the Patterson film. It strided across the road in 3-4 strides, and in as many was way off to the right again when it stopped mid-stride and looked back at me exactly like the patterson film, but this thing looked huge, even from the distance I saw it. When you see something that does not fit into the ordinary part of what you perceive as your reality, your brain tries to pidgeon-hole the data into one file after another, click click click click and suddenly you come up with ""Does not compute"" At first I thought was a smudge on my windshield, but it was moving right along. Just like the patterson film. So I went to work, and several people live near me and I decided to tell somebody. One guy had a girlfriend who seen him within a mile of my house within a month ago, and then a week ago his father came home at midnight telling him he had seen one in the same area in the headlight of his Harley where a small creek runs under the road and the creature appeared to be crossing the road where the small bridge was. It's weird how this effects you. I could really see how someone could keep this to themselves for their entire lives. However, when I shared this story, I got ""Oh yeah, this happened and that happened,"" To ""My Cousin, My Brother, My Dad, and even a couple of personal stories from people who grew up here. I was always willing to give it an open mind, but the lack of physical evidence sort of left me wondering, if I had to be honest. Now I know we share our woods with one big sumbitch, and you better be paying attention when you are cookin up that bacon at 8 pm in the woods around here cuz I don't think he got that big eatin dandelion greens. :) My impression, one HUGE Chewbacca/Harry and the Hendersons kinda guy, at least 2.5-3 ft thick thru the chest from back to front and if I had to estimate would be tall even for a Sasquatch at 9-12 ft like I said it was a quite a ways up the road, but I had time to see it, evaluate, and question it and look again, and then again after that as it looked to the right at me coming down the road, so it was a pretty firm sighting even if I am still questioning myself the next day. Like I said your brain tries to rationalize anything that ""Does not Compute"" but I was not under the influence of anything. Still puzzling and marvelling over it all.

"I had hiked up to Echo Lake along the Greenwater Echo Lake trail near Greenwater Washington. I and my friend had setup camp for the night along the northern edge of the lake. I woke up around 2 am to hearing very large stomping going through my camp. It sounded like ""stomp stomp stomp stomp"" and I could hear branches being broken as it was walking. I have never heard anything walk so loudly and it seemed to be moving quickly It sounded like it was heavy and was on 2 legs.. What terrified me is that i had reacted to the sound of the stomping by moving to grab my knife. The stomping then stopped and it went quiet. I felt like I was being watched. I didnt have my rainfly on over the tent. I was to afraid to look out and was trying to stay as still as I could in my sleeping bag. After what seemed like hours of waiting, I finally fell back asleep. My friend thought he heard loud foot steps durring the night while I was asleep.",Echo Lake northern area at the lake edge 200-300 feet to the left from the trail.,Pierce County,Washington,Fall,47.04433,-121.4234,10/7/12,36618,Class B,64.22,53.915,43.61,0.74,Clear throughout the day.
"Last year in October around 6 pm. I was sitting at a stop sign at a T in the road. I looked to my left and saw something come out of the woods. As I watched this thing, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up and I felt immediate terror. I was too shocked and scared to even pick up my cell phone and take a picture of it. I watched it walk across the road to the other side of the woods. It was not a bear as it walked on 2 legs. It was not a human as I looked for shoes, hands, facial features. It was black and hairy with long arms. It has taken me so long to say anything to anyone as I never knew where to report it to. Plus I didn't want people to think I was crazy. It never looked at me  But just stared straight ahead. I told my husband about it and he didn't know what to think. I wanted to go check for footprints however I'm disabled and walking in the woods would be hard plus I was terrified as well.","The stop sign located at 212th and 62nd Ave. Spanaway, WA",Pierce County,Washington,Fall,47.064,-122.3482,10/10/12,42395,Class A,51.53,49.65,47.77,0.83,Overcast throughout the day.
"My family and I live near Orting, Washington in The Buttes housing development.  My house is situated at the highest elevation in the development, right around 700 feet and near the water tower.  My back yard is bordered by woods that extend for 200-300 yards without interruption.  My bedroom window looks out over the back yard from a height of about 12 feet towards the woods and we always sleep with the window open. The first incident occurred right around the last week in August of this year (2012). At 2:45 a.m. my wife and I were awakened by a series of piercing shrieks.  They were very loud and sounded as though they were coming from the woods right in back of our house.  They did not sound like any other animal that I have ever heard. This continued for perhaps 5 minutes and then abruptly ceased as it began to rain.  The second incident happened approximately 5 weeks later early on a Tuesday morning in October of 2012.  This time, at just after 3 a.m. we were awakened by two shrieking screams followed by several minutes of intermittent whooping sounds, something like whoop..whoop...whoop...WHOOooop..This stopped almost immediately after we heard the same whoops from a distance of what I would estimate to be at least half a mile away.  The last incidence was in mid October at 3:15 a.m. when I was awakened to the same whooping sounds from a distance (1/4 mile?).  There were two sets of vocalizations just a few seconds apart, from two different sources.  There were some dogs barking like crazy at that time from the same general direction.  The whoops became closer and closer together until they overlapped (during this time they sounded as though they were moving further away from me, then they stopped.  I have not heard them since but I am going to try to record them on my cell phone if it happens again.",,Pierce County,Washington,Fall,47.06045,-122.157,10/15/12,38413,Class B,58.64,53.45,48.26,0.01,Rain starting in the afternoon.
"I was traveling up copper creek near Ashford Washington in my off roader doing a snow run to test out my new knuckle I put in. It was about 4pm and as I was turning a corner, I saw a large hairy biped creature cross in front of me and go up the bank to my right. I stopped and watched for a moment before it had disappeared into the forest. I kept an eye out the rest of the trip, but didn't see anything else. While parked at the top, I heard distinct wood knocks.

"On October 8, 2014 me and my wife we're out picking  mushrooms, above Wilkeson Washington, 20 miles or so from the base of Mt. Rainer. We parked at a forest service gate and walked in about 1 and a half miles to our spot, Where we have been many times before, its all old growth timber and really thick with old stumps and moss and what not, anyway, when we walked in my wife thought she heard an ax or something pounding on a tree. She said did you hear that? I was excited and finding mushrooms so I blew it off, and said come and pick this patch. An hour or so had passed, when I heard snapping and crunching about 100 yards away or so. And then we both heard thump thump thumping of what we concluded was a big rock pounding against a tree, now mind you, we are in the middle of pretty much nowhere, not a sole around. My wife and I stood in awe, and she said that sounds like wood knocks. My heart sunk as I watch a lot of bigfoot documentaries. I am an avid hunter and no all the sounds a forest or animal makes. Three minutes or so had passed from the tree pounding and crunching when all of a sudden SNAP, a tree or big branch we estimated around 5 or 6 inch in diameter snapped 20 feet behind us. We both jumped.as it was so loud and close.at that moment we ran. I said lets go, heck with the the mushrooms, as we were running past a lot. It was the scariest most unsurreal thing that's ever happened to me. 42 years in the woods and I never. I do not like to tell this story to my friends and stuff.as they laugh. But I know what we seen and experienced. Of all the times the one trip I did not carry my gun. Not that I would of shot.but I would of maybe got a picture or a visual or just felt more secure.

"Stepped out back for a smoke while I was on the phone. Heard a whooping sound. I stopped talking to my friend and continued to listen. I thought it might have been an elk but after hearing elk sounds definitely not it. The whoop did not tail off . It was a medium, not high pitched whoop. Very loud. Only way I can describe it is like a football punt. Whooooooooop. But stops at the high point. There was 3 or 4 of them and lasted around 3 seconds each. Continued to hear and you could hear the rustle in the thickets. Ran inside to get my roommate to hear it. When we got back out all the dogs in the neighborhood were barking.

"Last fall I lived in Eatonville, WA on Mashell Ave S just north of Alder St for about 7 months in an apartment at the edge of town. It was about 8:15pm in late November 2014 so it was dark, chilly, and clear outside. I had just gotten home and walked up to my front door and was about to push my key into the lock when I heard, what I can only describe as, a “hooting” noise like “Hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot” in rapid succession. I paused and turned around slowly and walked to the edge of my doorstep listening closer and it happened a second time “Hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot-hoot.” Following the second vocalization, all of the dogs in town began barking and howling incessantly. The noises did not sound very close, but it was extremely loud and sounded like it carried over from the mountain just south of town. I waited a little longer, but heard nothing more and so retreated to my apartment.  It sounded extremely ape-like and I have never heard anything like that before or since. The closest resemblance to those noises that I can find are in vocalization clips found on The Gorilla Foundation website www.Koko.org/vocalizations, only the vocalizations I heard had more “scream” to them and were much louder and very powerful. The sound went right through you and came from something with a huge chest. This was no coyote, elk, owl or otherwise, none of those can make a vocal this powerful. No one else was around at the time.",As described in my account and in enivronment,Pierce County,Washington,Fall,46.86113,-122.2669,11/20/14,49869,Class B,49.9,47.215,44.53,0.94,Overcast throughout the day.
"Hello, My husband was driving home last night on Key Peninsula highway in Pierce county in Washington State.

He witnessed a 7-8 foot creature, walk from the side of the road into the forest.

"We were going fishing, on May 29, 2016. We turned right at the Roy Y Going south. It was 5:15am. We were going south. We observed and exclaimed, ""that looks like an ape sitting on the side of the road. The animal was about three feet high in a sitting, crouched position. We were going south from left to right. We saw its left arm shoulder to elbow, left leg hip to knee, lower leg obscured. The head was larger with a sagital crest. Lantern shaped jaw that protruded slightly forward. The nose looked wide. And it had a protruding eyebrow like a Neanderthal. Its ears were covered in black hair tight to the head. No visible neck. Still going left to right, we can clearly see, shiny black hair. The animal leaned forward head going low, could see top of both black haired ears. Our distance at this point is between 22 to 25 feet. The animal extends its right arm from the shoulder parallel to the ground and drops some trash from its hands. The arm had black hair all the way to the knuckles. The arm was to long to be human. When it dropped the trash, a thumb and four fingers were clearly visible.The animal moved its right arm back in front of its torso, ninety degrees of angle. Not a bear. It did this action twice. Still going left to right, the right arm from shoulder to elbow is visible, below the right arm, between right arm and right leg, right leg visible from top of buttocks to hip to knee, partially covered by green plastic garbage bag. We estimate its overall height to be between five foot six inches to six feet tall. We said moma-squatch would not leave baby that close to the road.

I was awake and laying in bed with the window open at around sunrise. I heard two wood knocks that sounded very close in the nearby forest followed immediately by a more distant howl. It was a very deep howl. It sounded like a large animal. I have heard elk bugles and this was not what I heard. I have also heard coyotes from here so I am familiar to what they sound like.

Early this morning, probably about 2 am, several of the scouts and their parents were awoken by a series of what they described as whoops.  My wife described three whoops as being VERY close and a short time later, maybe a few minutes, another series of whoops farther away as if the animal was moving away. She said it was unnerving to the point that she wasn't going to leave the tent the rest of the night.  She described the sound as nothing she has ever heard before.

"Sound sighting only summer of 2016 on a fishing trip in Mt. Rainier National Park. A friend and I started our hike from Forest Service road 73 into Mt. Rainier Nat'l. Park via the trail that goes past Lake Eleanor. This was the closest we could get to our fishing destination, (Oliver Lake) due to longtime road closures in the area. We hiked in on maintained trails through Grand Park and down to the White River and then up Lake James. From that point it was a cross country bushwhack past Lake Ethel along Mosquito Flat onto Marjorie Lake. Our plan was for two nights at Oliver Lake but with some route finding difficulty we stayed at Marjorie lake for one night. The next morning we hiked for about fifteen minutes and located Oliver lake, set up camp and then began fishing. As we fished around part of the lake from approximately 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. I found it odd that I did not see any sign of other human evidence of any kind, ie; fisherman trails, trash, areas previously camped in, etc. By the way the fishing was fantastic all catch and release except for the last one, a nice 15 inch rainbow trout which was dinner. Later that night at in the tent my buddy and I were sharing, my buddy was fast asleep and I was tossing and turning trying to get comfortable. Suddenly I hear guttural low pitched screams coming from the ridge above us, which I estimate about three hundred feet up. Every inch of my body is at attention now and I am trying to figure out what is making the noise. The screams came in quick succession and total about 8-10 screams. By the time I wake up my buddy the screams have stopped and I explained to him what I heard. We continued to listen and did not hear anything else and eventually went to sleep. I am writing this now because it jogged my memory from watching a bigfoot show on TV last night and it really struck a chord with me and to reach out and report what I heard. I have been an active hiker, camper and fisherman for many many years and have stayed in many remote places here, Canada, Europe and South America and have never heard this type of low pitched guttural screams. I have come across bear and cougar and did not attribute this sound to any of those species.

I was just looking around for deer or bear, this area is well known for black bear, one had been shot a week before in this area. I heard some branches breaking down from me about 100 yrds. so I started watching in the direction of the noise. I saw a few tree branches moving, not like from wind and all of a sudden I saw what looked like a brownish/black shoulder and head of something, I don't know for sure what it was but I know that I've been in the woods a lot in my 51 years and nothing ever before made the hair on my neck stand up in the woods like it did that day. Also there was a faint odor of rotten meat or rotten trash??? I'm not sure if it was a bigfoot or not but it might be worth checking out.

"I was driving on the North Cascades Highway (HWY 20) traveling east across the pass. It was close to twilight and it was clear and cold. While close to Rainy Pass (maybe a bit before), I see something that strikes me as not normal. It is about 1/4 mile up the highway on the side of the road. At first, I think that it is a large man wearing dark, winter clothing. As I got closer, I see that it was clearly not a man. But just before I got a better look, it slipped down the side of the road into the ravine. And that was when I knew what I had just seen. The way it moved was sylph-like. Almost as if it shimmered away. I looked back to where it had been, and it had completely disappeared. Now, if that isn't enough for you, there's more. About two miles further up the mountain pass, I saw another. It was a little smaller, but moved in the same graceful manner as it quickly went down the side of the mountain out of my view. The leaves on the tree that it had been next to still gently shook as I drove by. I cannot say with any surety what these creatures looked like exactly. But they were definitely not bears - too tall and far too graceful. They were not human - too graceful and quick. They were both dark though. If they were at all reddish, I did not notice. They both seemed to be very dark brown. The smaller one darker than the bigger one. If I was to guess size, I would say the larger one was 6'4"" - 6'8"" and probably around 250 - 300 lean pounds. The smaller was perhaps 6'0? And around 200 lbs maybe? The thing that was so completely out of the ordinary, was the manner in which they moved. I have never seen something so large move so fluidly.

"It was early afternoon on a hot summer day.  I was up looking for oyster mushrooms in the hills west of Baker Lake Rd by Grandy Creek.  I have had several experiences in the fall time over several years.  Anyway, as I was walking in on a wooded hillside and happened to look down and saw an impression in a mossy patch that looked like an old sasquatch track. The ground is not good for impressions except for the mossy patches.  It measured 15 inches long. It was broad at the toes, and had a wide heel,  There was even a rise, in the middle of the track, as if  from a mid-tarsal break. It may not be a track, it may be a track. If a track, it had been there for some time, as it had small debris sitting in it. I was up there this fall,and the possible track was still in the same condition so it should still be able to located.  BTW I got a good haul of oyster mushrooms that day. I have heard deep rhythmic grunts, followed by a tree shaking in the creek bottom. My dad and I heard this breathing that was loud and angry sounding.  Possible it could have been a grizzly, but it was somewhat different than sounds I have looked up on the internet. I had small rocks thrown at me. My wife and I heard 3 wood knocks one after the other from 3 different but close locations. All these incidents happened from about 2008 until present.

"I was out riding my bike and came to the logging road and started walking because you don't ride bikes where cougars dwell.  So I hiked for a while enjoying the sights and the trail forks in a y-shape and I took a left and walked up the hill.  After I got to the top of the hill I walked down a little further and at my 2 o'clock I heard a large branch snap like how a twig snaps under a man's foot and the brush crashed and I heard what sounded like a baseball bat hit a tree.  When I looked at where the noise came from and I saw to my horror a rock come towards me from out of the bushes and my eyes caught the hand throwing the rock, and when I noticed the hand I saw it jump in the air and do a 180 spin so it would be faced away from me when it landed and I swear to god it threw the rock so freakin hard that the entire rock didn't spin at all when it was being chucked.  It bonked the stump on the side of the trail and I kept staring at it because I thought at first it was a ghost or mabye somebody behind the stump that I just saw do a ninja move. Then I realized that it was facing away from me towards the swampy brush because the stump I was looking had a muscley buttocks and I could see on the top of the stump what looked like a v shape tuft of hair similar to Howard the Duck.

"I was hiking, with my dog, at Wallace Falls State Park on 4/26/11. I started the hike at about 11:30am and there were only two other vehicles in the entire parking lot. I had hiked passed the upper portion of the falls, following an old logging road up to Wallace Lake. I only saw one other hiker coming down from the falls lookout. At approximately 2pm, my dog and I were walking towards the lake (it was about 1.5 miles away). We heard a very strange, humanoid yell come from across a marshy bog area. We both were taken by surprise and stopped. I looked across the bog area up towards the thick forest on the other side (about 75 yards away). I couldnt see any clothing of a hiker or potential body of a humanoid creature. The sound however was very interesting. I've spent many hours hiking the Washington state forests. I know what certain animals sound like when calling for a mate or calling to signal a warning. This noise was different. It was comparable to a person yelling directly and loudly ""yoouuuuuu!!!"". My dog and I stopped dead in our tracks and listened. About a minute went by and I heard the same noise again from the same area. The loud and direct ""yooouuuuu!!"". It was very strange. I'm positive that whatever made the noise was either a human toying with me, or some humanoid creature warning me of its presence. Being miles up alone in the wilderness, I didn't want to John Wayne across a bog into thick brush to investigate. It was the first time I've ever heard such a unique sound while out in the forest.

"On September 1st, 2011 I was camping up in the beautiful Cascade Mountains of Washington State with my friend Dave (my name is Dave as well). We got there early on Thursday to get the spot we wanted. It was for us the start of the Labor Day weekend. We had set up camp and drove up an old logging road to get our firewood for the night. There is a bridge close to our campsite. We had supper and relaxed around the campfire. At about 10:30 that night I decided to grab a flashlight and go looking around the area across the bridge. I really had not planned on looking for Bigfoot as I was busy with the logistics of putting this camping trip together. I am a true believer in Sasquatch, and read Bigfoot stories all the time(ask my wife). As I cleared the bridge there is a dead-end road on the right that goes down for about a quarter mile or so. I know this because I have been down there. The road is gated at the top with a pipe gate. In the middle of the gate is a red reflector. I could not see the reflector because something was standing in front of it. I had shined my just regular flashlight, with about ¾ battery power down this road. What I did see was a pair of big yellow eyes, looking back at me. I FROZE. I remember thinking: Oh My GOD! I noticed that the right eye was much brighter than the left eye. I thought that perhaps there was some hair hanging down over the inside of the left eye. Or maybe it had an injury. I then noticed how far apart the eyes were. And how high up from the ground they were. Actually they were roughly even with mine, but the road there sloped down a bit. About four feet or more! I’m 5’8” on a good day. This “thing” would have towered over me! The creature was either dark brown or black, as I could not make out any body or head features at all. Just those yellow eyes. There was no odor at all. The air was perfectly still. It made no noise either. I processed all this very quickly. If it would have growled at me it would have been laundry time! We stared at each other for maybe 10-12 seconds. It seemed to kind of lean side to side a little. Without moving its feet. Then the eyes dropped down a little and made a big circle. Pause. Then another circle same as the first. Like an owl, only way bigger. I thought that he had put his hands on his knees maybe. Kind of like I have seen on TV of apes moving.It looked at me for 3 more seconds and I lost it. Not knowing what this thing was going to do next, I took off running to the middle of the bridge and spun around. Every hair on my body was standing up. It did not follow me. I was not surprised. But I was also very happy. I was panting. Mostly from adrenaline, I think! I hustled back to camp and told Dave what happened. I said “Let’s go back over there. “Grab your camera” (a digital with a strong flash and video+audio). I was very excited. I knew that this could be a chance of a lifetime to get this thing on film. You have to understand that in my mind, there was nothing else that this creature could be than a REAL Sasquatch. I completely believe it to this day. Anyways, Dave Cannot find his camera. After we looked for a couple of minutes or so I get pissed and said, or words to the effect “Let’s go while this thing is still in the same county”! So we get to the bridge and walk fast at first, then slow way down being quiet. I whispered “ You watch the left side and I’ll watch this side. We’ll try to get both flashlights on it at the same time”. Dave’s flashlight was about the same as mine). It wasn’t in front of the gate anymore. That didn’t surprise me. What I did see was the red reflector. I did not even know it was even there the 1st time. But there it was. It would have stuck out like a sore thumb! It was blocked by the Bigfoot.On Dave’s side was a pull-out. It was empty. (The next night some people ‘Camped’ there). I told Dave “Shine your light up the road”. There HE was! On my side walking slowly towards us. He had the exact same eyes. The left one was messed up, just like the 1st time! Dave and I were about 10-12 feet apart. I said “Dave, THERE HE IS! Do you see him? He’s coming Dave! There he is!”. Both of our lights had shined on this things face at the same time. Only for like 3 seconds or so. But it lit his head up!  The head did not look pointed to me, like many people have reported. It was really BIG though. I was slowly backing up as I watched it walking towards us. “Don’t you see it ?” “No” he says. I was backing up slowly out of fear as I’m watching the eyes move up and down rhythmically. . Well, it turns out that Dave can’t see much in bright sunlight.  At night he is basically following the sound of your voice. So he can’t find his camera at the critical time; and I have no witness to this incidence, even though he was right there with me! I love the guy. But FU$%! So I get scared and take off running to the middle of the bridge again, with Dave behind me. The only reason he is running is because I was. You ever hear the joke about never going Grizzly Bear hunting with a friend who can out-run you? Well I out-weight Dave and he had trouble keeping up!   It was HUGE!  Also, although the road was going up hill, it was very straight and flat. I was familiar with this stretch of road, having camped there many times. And this gave me a great idea of how tall this thing was. When I say it was pushing ten feet tall, I feel confident that this is an accurate judgment of its true height. And there were NO tree branches there at all to justify an owl sitting on a limb. If it was an owl, it would have to be 10 feet tall. So we quickly get back to camp. Dave of course, finds his camera. Under his sleeping bag. We jumped into the van and shot across the bridge. Of course we could not find him. I knew he was just inside the trees on one side or the other. It was as dark as the inside of a Buffalo on a moon-less night. The next morning I walked across the bridge to the top of the road on the right. I walked up to the pipe gate and stood there. Right exactly where HE stood. I paced it off, and it was roughly 45 yards to where I stood when I first spotted him. Boy, I sure will bring a massive candle power flashlight next time! And have a camera ready as well. But you get your chances when they happen. I was not prepared! One thing I haven’t mentioned. At the time this all happened, I had truly forgotten that in my tent were my two guns. I had my 9mm, plus a 12 gauge sawed-off double barreled shotgun(side by side and barely legal) loaded with 00 BUCK. It had never occurred to me to shoot this guy. I had completely forgotten that I was heavily armed! When he was walking down the road towards us, he, in retrospect, was just kind of shooing us away I think. I think of him as being a gentle giant! He very easily could have run us down and killed us. I feel blessed that they are out there. He did not harass us or threaten us in any way. Other than just leisurely walking towards us and scaring the CRAP out of me!I will go back there this summer,more prepared for sure. STOP!!!!!! - I haven’t told anyone yet, except for now. I also have a Class B report that happened back in 1975, up it Whatcom County near the Canadian border. This encounter was truly TERRIFIYING! Scared all 3 of us, plus the Big German Shepard ( who PEED himself) that  we had with us in a remote cabin. Ask me about that Story!!

"Me and my girlfreind went camping up in the MT. Loop area in snohomish county and when we got to our campsite, we saw a couple large footprints along the side of the dirt road next to were we parked, i immediately disregarged it being a bigfoot and figured that it was someone with enormous feet running around barefoot prior to us getting there. as it started to get darker we both had heard what sounded like someone yelling in a deep voice then turned into what sounded like a low tone groan and then stopped, this happened at about 9:30 pm. my girlfreind started to get scared so i told her it was probably just a bear making its sound and i lit a fire and we sat around the fire and talked for a few hours. once we we wanted to go to bed, we climbed into the back of the jeep and as i was closing the back door we heard the same sound again but allot closer to our area. after the noise stopped and about an hour went by we had heard loud rusttling sounds in the bushes on the upper part of the hill on the other side of the road and very loud footfalls and we also heard something very large splashing in the river which was i would say 30 feet from our jeep. we both shined flashlights out the windows but couldnt see anything, as we were doing that a vehicle came down the road and slammed their brakes on just passed our camp site. we heard them get out of their vehicle and started talking so i got out and went to them and asked if everything was okay, and their response to my question was that some massive hairy thing ran across the road right infront of them which they almost hit. they said oh it could of been bigfoot jokingly until i told them the sounds that we were hearing all night and they said that we should probably go then cause that sounds really creepy and that theyve heard of reports in the area of a ""bigfoor"" in the past. now thats kind of the breif rundown of what happened that night, but i am still a skeptic about it but anything is possible, i am millitary i serve in the US army and have seen allot of crazy things so it wouldnt surprise me that its real, but im still a skeptic. The last incident that ive had with a ""bigfoot"" which im not the only one who saw this, but we were out doing a bradley gunner at a range on base, and a bradley IFV has very detailed thermal scopes on it for night shooting, and we all saw what appeared to be  a very large person running at the very far edge of the range which is almost 2 miles away, i saw it, and 3 other people in three other vehicles saw the same thing, so we asked range control if anyone was down there were we were shooting and they said there shouldnt be and sent someone down to check it out but there was nothing to be found.","MT loop is right outside of darrington washington, very easy to find, follow the signs all the way up till you hit dirt road. and fort lewis, you would have to contact me about that incident",Snohomish County,Washington,Summer,48.04725,-121.4469,8/25/12,36647,Class B,73.07,59.655,46.24,0.3,Clear throughout the day.

"My fiancee and I were driving on a road in Marysville, Washington called Hilltop Rd.  It starts off winding through woods and while curving to the right we saw this gigantic light brown to dark tan hairy figure cross from right to left.  I couldn't see the head because it was above the area illuminated by the truck lights, but I saw that the shoulders were at least three feet across, and at the shoulders it was at least 8-8.5 feet tall, and while it ran I could see the arm/shoulder movement and the thighs move as well.  With how steep the area it was that it went down, and how wooded and rainy it was I don't think a human could navigate its way down there as quickly as it did, because by the time I had stopped and gotten out it was gone, but you could hear the crashing of it moving through the brush and trees.",North from Marysville on 67th to Hilltop Road.

"Me, my wife, and our 7 year old son were out for an evening bear hunt up to Coal Lake last night. We hadn't seen any sign of life at all the entire night covering several roads off mountain loop hwy, this was no exception. We stopped at the outhouse there at Coal Lake and walked up to the lake, at the time I thought it was weird that there was no wildlife at all. I mean none, no birds, nothing. After looking around a bit we got back in the truck and headed down the hill. We drove about 1/4 mile and found a small pile of scat in the road so I stopped to look at it, that's when I got a feeling that I was being watched. I went back to the truck and grabbed  my rifle and continued to look around. As I cleared the rear of the truck and approached the edge of the bank I started hearing some thrashing below me. I got excited thinking we found a bear but the longer we sat the less excited and more uneasy I got. The thrashing didn't move unless I moved. I worked my way down the road past the front of the truck trying to see what was making the noise but couldn't see it. I did get really nervous at this point because the thrashing followed me down the road. I have hunted elk and bear in Montana and Washington my whole life and never had one parallel the road with me nor be that close without growling. I was very well armed with a sidearm and a heavy magnum rifle but I had no interest in exploring this more. I don't know what it was, probably nothing, I do believe bigfoot is real however it never crossed my mind till my son told us that it was  not a bear it was Bigfoot.  But I can tell you it felt like my blood went cold.","East on the Mountain Loop Hiway from Granite Falls, then left on Coal Lake Road and approximately 5 miles to road end and the lake.",Snohomish County,Washington,Summer,48.10892,-121.5186,8/7/13,41825,Class B,73.81,59.565,45.32,0.03,Clear throughout the day.

"I had gotten up from sleeping to go to the bathroom, my dog came with me and was standing next to me.  I stood there a moment longer enjoying the peace when I heard a sound like an air raid siren. It stretched for 3 or 4 seconds and was followed immediately by 3 whoops.  My dog and I were both staring quietly for about 10 minutes and heard nothing else.  After hearing the sound I used my flashlight to search 180 degrees in the direction of the sound.  My dog was with me, he has a strong prey drive though he obeys very well, he heard it and did not move a muscle only stared in the exact direction that the sound came from.  This animal was within 70 feet of me so it was clear and fairly loud (as loud as an amplified siren we use at work).

"Saturday May 9th my girlfriend I and were returning from an overnight camp off the Mountain Loop Highway. I wanted to find a place to shoot that was off the road and away from any trails, the river, or possible campers. Found a spot that didn’t have a car for more than a mile each way. Pulled over and loaded up about 10 magazines. Spent about 15 minutes getting everything ready on the tailgate of my truck. Heard absolutely nothing but birds chirping. I hiked down a ravine to the left of the road about 150 yards and shot off some rounds for about 15 minutes. Finished up and walked back up to the car where my girlfriend had been waiting. As soon as I came out of the ravine and onto the road we both heard a LOUD cracking / snap noise from the top of the wooded hill that was to the right of the road, the opposite side of where I had been shooting. We both looked at each other wondering what it was, our jaws dropped. It wasn’t a tree breaking because we didn’t hear anything hit the ground. There was also no wind less a sporadic slight breeze. We heard the noise approximately 6-7 times and there was about 30 seconds between each one. It was very loud and very, very close. The time between each one was also very consistent. My girlfriend and I both said that we could hear it coming form the top of the hill maybe 100 yards from the truck. We could also hear something moving around. Not twigs and branches snapping but it sounded like bark rounds being stepped on and ripping. A strange noise, it actually sounded like something ripping bark from a tree too. I grabbed my cell phone and walked up the hill to where the sound was coming from. Filmed about ten minutes. I was filming up and to the right of the hill for a good 6 minutes. As soon as I walked a little closer to the top of the hill and started filming to my left another cracking sound rings out, startled the hell out of me because it was so close. The camera actually shakes when the noise starts from me reacting. This was just about seven minutes into filming. I heard the sound of bark or something again, like it was peeling off a tree. I couldn’t help but think that the sound was coming from up in a tree. I got it on my phone and you can hear how loud it was, and how close. I would guess whatever was making the noise was about 50 yards away. Returned to the car and left. I thought it was very strange that this noise didn’t start until after I made all the noise shooting. When I made it to the area where the noise originated I could see my truck. It’s like whatever made the noise waited until it saw me get back on the road. The noise it made was so loud I am perplexed as to what it was. It sounded like a large branch being hit on a tree and snapping. I can’t think of any animal that makes any noise that loud. I’ve spent countless hours in the backcountry and camping and have never heard anything like it. As much as I wanted to climb the next 50 yards to the very top of the hill I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I had the feeling that whatever the hell was making that noise was protesting my being there. I still had my pistol on me but it was loud enough that I decided to head back to the car.","Off the Mountain Loop Highway, I would have to drive back there and reset my odometer to see how far it was from the Monte Cristo trailhead.",Snohomish County,Washington,Spring,48.13261,-121.3539,5/9/15,48652,Class B,69.36,54.06,38.76,0.69,Clear throughout the day.
"Me and my friend are rock climbers. We've rock climbed nearly everywhere in Washington state. The Pacific Northwest is the main area we've climbed in, and the area we know the best. He is a hardcore skeptic. I on the other hand am a firm believer. I've done tons of research through books and documentaries and consider myself to be fairly knowledgeable about the subject. After this experience my friend is now been having some second thoughts. It all started in the early morning... We drove up to the trail head about 5 miles on a gravel trail to the trail head. We got out of the car and put on our packs, locked the car and started to head up hill. Ours was the only car in the small parking lot. While filling out the trail registry that's when I heard the first knock up hill about 30 yards away. Like two minutes later another knock was heard down the hill and past the road, about 50 yards off. Every now and again you could hear sticks breaking like something was stepping on them. The sound of one stick breaking was heard then silence. I tried to do my own knock and that was responded too after about 30 seconds. That's when we started filming. After the film we decided to move uphill to go and climb. My friend still wasn't really buying it. He thought they were just sticks falling off of the trees. After walking about 17 feet up the trail we heard another knock in the same place. By this time my friend was asking me if they're ever hostile. I was thinking about it being intimidation but I didn't think that's what they were getting at. After walking about 30 more feet up the trail we heard the sound of a rock tapping on a tree, in a very repetitious pattern. For my friend this was the point were he was staring to take things seriously, and wanted to leave. I had no rejections. Before leaving I tried looking down the hill (where the other knocks where coming from) to see anything. The terrain didn't drop off like expected. The road was only three or so feet higher. The woods where very dense. Anything could hide in them. A few days later we went back up to the same place to actually climb, only to be shut down by the rain. We still decided to do the hike up to the base of the climb anyway. After a little while I thought to make a knock as well as some whoops to see if there was anything in the area. I had no response. About half way up we saw a standard stick structure. As well as a whole lot of tracks going up the trail. We were the only ones on this mountain by this point. And by the looks of it the creatures followed the same trail all the way up the mountain. Until the part where the trail goes out into an open boulder filed.","The noises where right on the side of the road, we started to hear them the minute we got out of the car.

"It was fall.  About 9 at night. Just getting dark.  A friend and I were camping on Mica Peak in Spokane County WA.  We decided to go for a quick hike just before dark.  We were walking an old logging road.  As we came around a right hand bend, we saw the outline of a man standing next to a small pine tree. The tree was only about 12 feet or so tall and Christmas tree shaped, but fairly sparse branches.  The ""man"" was standing to our right of the tree.  It was around 30 yards from us.  At this point it was getting too dark to make out much detail of the thing, but it was about 4 feet shorter than the tree, dark and wide.  The tree wasn't moving, but the ""man"" was swaying slowly from side to side.  We backed up slowly till we were around the corner out of sight before we turned and got back to camp as fast as we could to start a fire.  We were camped near a creek in a valley.  That night after sitting by the fire talking and playing guitars we went to bed.  While laying in the tent just about asleep, from back up near the logging road we had hiked, we heard screaching.  The only thing comparable I've ever heard were chimpanzees on tv. There were 5 or 6 screaching sounds in about 10 minutes and that was it. We laid in the tent holding our pistols most of the night, but didn't hear anything else.","On Mica Peak, WA",Spokane County,Washington,Fall,47.5505,-117.167,9/15/10,47470,Class B,76.87,65.1,53.33,0.27,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.
"Sunday January 8th, 2017. My husband and I were snowshoeing out from my parents property towards Antoine Peak conservation area around 12:30 pm. We had gone for about 45 minutes away from the house, seeing lots of wildlife along the trails including deer, rabbit and moose. There were lots of tracks along the way as well. We came upon a trail where all of a sudden the deer trails we had been following, swerved off the main trail and up the hillside. Up ahead was a single set of tracks that appeared to be a bi-pedal animal of some kind and there the smell was something awful. We weren't sure what to make of the tracks at first so we just continued along the trail. I immediately noticed how far apart the tracks were and became very aware of what we COULD have been looking at. I had my husband try to  match his stride to those of the tracks, and he came up  VERY short. We didn't  come prepared with tape measures or anything like that, but my Husband is 5'9"" and he could only get to about half of the stride length.  We  continued to follow the trail of tracks for several hundred feet and they suddenly turned and,  what looked like, jumped off the side of the hill towards a clearing where there is a pond in the summer months. At the time there was about a foot of snow on the ground and the following day, another 6+ inches fell. We are not sure what created these tracks, but I am unaware of anything with such characteristics in this area.","Antoine Peak Conservation Area.

"Heard: at approx 2:15am my labrador retriever started barking at something outside.  This is not unusual as we live on a closed golf course which is adjacent to Riverside State Park and we often have varying types of nature near our home.  After letting the dog out to relieve himself I returned to bed.  Outside temp was approx 55-60 degrees and we had the bedroom windows open.  Our bedroom faces the closed golf course. What I heard next was a loud howl. At first I thought it was a police car or ambulance traveling on highway 291 that had turned on its siren, but then the sound simply went from soft to loud to suddenly stopping. So, it was not a siren.  I listened intently to try to figure out what was going on and about 2 minutes later I heard a similar but more faint ""siren"" sound. This was not a coyote or a wolf, nor was it the sound of a neighbor's dog.  The sound was different and as I said, it sounded like a siren with only one whooooooo. I noted the time (2:20am).  It sounded like it could have been a few blocks away (I thought around 7 Mile Road). I have been checking local websites and facebook groups to see if anyone else heard it, but so far nothing.  I can't be the only one to have heard this.  Perhaps a person was making the noise as part of Big Foot hunting?? The other thing I'd like to report is that we feed birds and squirrels in our yard.  Approx 6weeks prior we had our squirrel feeder torn off the tree at night.  We heard a crash outside and couldn't identify anything that particular night but the following morning we discovered the feeder's lid which is crewed into the top on a heavy hinge, was ripped off.  We jokingly said maybe we should look for Big Foot prints or hair in the area. Anyway,  the howl was definitely something not of the ordinary.

"I’m not sure what/if I saw. In December of 2020 I was driving my kid to work at 5am. I was on a back road near the Spokane River at Seven Mile, which is part of the Riverside Park area. As I came up a small hill with a turn, on the left side of the road, just off the road, I saw what appeared to be the silhouette of a sasquatch. I frequently drive this road and had not had a sighting before or since. What I saw was slightly taller than a speed limit/road sign. I looked away to check the road, and when I glanced back over there was nothing to see. I have tried to explain this as being tired, but I am awake at about 4am every day, so I’ve ruled that out. I checked this page and saw the report from the gal near the old golf course, which I live on the other end of that course. This sighting was not far from where she was when she heard her strange howl.

"My husband and I owned 32 acres in rural Stevens county for almost 10 years. The property had been logged several times but still had a good but not dense, mix of Ponderosa, Larch and Doug fir. We camped there almost year round in a travel trailer while we were building a cabin. We dug and lined a large pond for irrigation which attracted lots of wildlife and had planted a small orchard and garden. In 2013, I decided to camp for a few days by myself and work on our cabin and garden. It was mid-July and a very hot, dry summer. During the first two days as I walked the 50 yards or so to and from the trailer to the cabin, I felt like I was being watched but chalked it up to the wild animals or birds. The third day, I came out of the cabin to go make lunch and there was a hairy animal standing next to and somewhat leaning on the shed behind the trailer. I thought at first it was a person because it was on two legs and how it seemed to lean on the shed (like a human). It was hard to tell because the shed was in the shadows behind the trailer and the trailer. I yelled “Hey! you’re trespassing! This is private property!!” The animal turned and ran a few steps, dropped to all fours and ran off behind the shed and disappeared. It could have been a black bear but it looked so human-like. On the third day, after working all day in the cabin, I turned off the radio, closed the door and headed to the trailer to make dinner, eat and retire at about 10 p.m. We always carry guns when we are at our place and I put my rifle on the table when I went to bed. Because it was still hot, I left all the windows open in the trailer that night. About 2 a.m., I was startled awake by a series of knocks on wood. There were four measured knocks, four different times coming from four different directions. The first set of four knocks sounded very close and could have been about 20 feet away from the trailer. It was a slow knock, knock, knock, knock. There was a pause of about 60-90 seconds before the next set of knocks, which sounded in the opposite direction of the first. It was much further away this time. I couldn’t tell you how far. The third set of knocking was the same cadence but closer and again, from a different direction, maybe 200 yards away. The last set of knocking was the same as the others, from a fourth direction and possibly a 500 yards away. I was wide awake and my heart was pounding. My rifle was on the table and I was so scared I was paralyzed and could barely breathe, afraid I would be heard. I couldn’t even move to get up and get to the table! I laid in bed listening for more noises but must have fallen asleep as the next thing I remember, sun was streaming through the windows, birds were singing and it was 6:30 in the morning! The next day I went over to my nearest neighbor who had the next lot over and asked him if he had heard anything. He hadn’t but suggested the neighbor down by the county road (a half mile away) might have been hammering. That neighbor hadn’t been seen at his place for more than a month! Then, on August 21, 2017, my husband and I were in Baker City, Oregon to see the eclipse. A small fair was being held in the town park and we were wandering around looking at the crafts, food, etc. We came to a Bigfoot booth and I told the man about my story. He then played a recording he had made in the Cascades a few years back and there in his recording was my exact experience four years earlier!

"While hunting in Washington in October of 2013 I was camping with two friends at an Air Force survival school camp ground north of Colville.  We had just finished eating a steak and baked potato dinner around the campfire and were talking when we heard a loud ""bang"" sound that sounded similar to when you set a large round log on top of another for splitting.  It was only estimated to be about 50-60 yards away and very loud.  We are all experienced woodsmen and the noise was enough for all of us to grab our spotlights and guns and face that direction as we had never heard anything like that before.  After about 5 minutes we sat back down and were discussing the sound when it happened again just as loud.  At this point we discussed all three sleeping in the truck to be safe that night.  We stayed up late that night and did not hear it again...but we all slept with our weapons loaded and at the ready every night after.   In the morning I went and looked for any tracks but could not find any as the snow had melted and the ground was saturated with pine needles and leaves.",29  miles north of Colville off of Smackout Creek rd.

"My husband and I live in the back woods of Clayton, Washington. We were driving around our property which is the side of a large heavily wooded hill/mountain. We were trying to find a place to build our cabin. We drove to the top stopping about halfway to look over the edge of what we call the pixie stix. A bunch of trees that had been fallen by previous owners stacked on the side of the hill like pixie stix. We noticed something had been moving logs and stumps around. Probably a bear though we saw one stump out of place for a bear. It had been pulled straight up out of the ground tap root and all still intact. No sign of the rocking motion that a bear does to remove roots. No claw marks. So we looked around for bear tracks and really didn't find much. We went back to the truck and continued to the top of the hill removing trees and branches with the chainsaw to get through. When we got there we removed some more branches and scoped the area for our cabin all the while there was something staying just out of visual contact but walking around behind us on the neighbor lot. We left when we were done. We went back down the hill and started up another road that my husband had built with our dozer a few months earlier, as we started up the road which is not that long, I was startled when I was looking at a tree that I didn't remember was there and it turned and quickly moved out of sight to the left. I yelled at my husband asking him what that was? he said ""what?"" I asked him if he saw it, he said no. The branch about 8-9 ft above the ground was still moving rapidly from where the head, I assume it was the head, hit it (I saw that happen). He stopped next to where it was and we could not see anything. We continued up farther on the road and got out and I was talking to him and he said to hush. He had heard something about a minute or two later just as he literally started  to say ""ok I heard a ""woop"" just once. Again he was talking so I did not hear it. He wasn't believing that I saw something. So we looked around this area for another possible cabin site. After about 20 - 25 minutes we went back down to the bottom of the hill (home). That night we started hearing things. This time hubby heard it too. Later that evening when we went to bed and lights were out there was banging on the side of our cabin and then a short time later things were hitting our cabin. Not rocks really don't have any around so it had to be sticks. My husband is a believer now. He was scared. I'm nervous to go outside when I'm here by myself. The next day I did go out and look for footprints around our cabin and found a huge print behind our cabin but it was an older print. It looked like a huge flat footed huge toed person. I showed my husband and he started looking in the area and found another it looked about the same age. So my husband has been leaving food out for it but we don't know what is taking the food. We think maybe due to the fires here in Washington they are on the move but we also have been hearing strange howl/growl sounds that are very loud for months. Our cat would always be in the same area as the sounds as if it was talking to our cat. Yesterday something went after my chickens and so there was a lot of commotion and then I kept hearing branches breaking and woop woop sounds.

"Friday Oct 22, 9:40 pm I had just left our local school homecoming football game in Springdale Washington, with 2 of my children and a friend of theirs (2 High School freshman and a mid schooler). We were driving south on Highway 231 and as we approached Sanctuary Way (47.9763678, -117.7323568) just off the highway in the ditch I noticed a very large black ""thing"" in the tall yellow, uncut grass. I initially thought it may be a black wolf, so i slowed down and stared at it as we approached. By the time we drove to it, we were traveling about 35-40 MPH. As we reached it I was in shock and amazement as it was an ape like figure hunched down in the ditch staring right at me.  From the crouched position he/she took two steps away from the road. It was almost as it was slow motion as it felt our eyes were locked and its head was on a swivel as we rolled by. I wished I had slammed on the brakes but we had 2 cars behind us and I was literally shocked. We turned at the first turnout available 60 yards up the road) let the cars go by and returned to the location but did not see or hear anything at all.

"On wed march 20,2012 My 2, sons J and T, and 2 friends S and T along with myself, went out to target practice outside the town of Rainer, Wash. It was about 5:40 when we came through a hay field and stopped to decide where we should go next. I was looking across the field scanning the tree line that runs along the edge of the river. At the far southwest end of the field I notice a figure getting up out of a blackberry patch. It was huge and dark. I couldnt tell how tall it was but I could tell it was massive. Big shoulders long arms and wide body all covered in brown hair. The hair on it head looked like it went to its shoulders. It stood up and walk from the center of the patch to the trail in front of it. I brought it to the attention of the others with me as it crossed the trail and stood next to a fir tree it looked back at us. It turned and walked south into the next hay field and towards the southwest corner. We ran to were we saw it. We found nothing. The blackberry bushes looked like something used it as a bed, all the branches were bent down flat. We compared the fir tree with my son T to get an idea of how tall it was, my son is 6ft and the creature was at least 8.5 we took pictures then followed the grass trail it left behind (We could see where it went across the field in bent grass) and into the second field and stopped at the edge of the third and noticed that ahead of us the birds flew out of the trees making alot of noise. a few minutes later we heard dogs barking in the distance but not to far. Then we heard a load knocking sound for 5 or 6 beats. Everything went real quiet then we heard what sounded like a popping sound  followed by several hoots. We waited in the trees for several more minutes but heard and saw nothing out of place",(Exact location details edidted by the investigator to protect the location),Thurston County,Washington,Spring,46.78571,-122.7515,3/20/12,34710,Class A,43.68,38.815,33.95,0.94,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.
"My son (age 31) and I had spent the night sleeping in our truck camper in the Horseshoe Cove campground at Baker Lake, WA. The next morning, Sat. June 14, 2014, we decided to drive up Baker Lake Rd. to look at the other campgrounds. We pulled into the Swift creek campground (formerly Baker Lake Resort) and paid for space 34. We parked our truck in our campsite and then took a walk above the lake shore. We came to an area that had a picnic table above the lake shore. Over to the right of us were a few people swimming in the swimming area. I sat on top of the picnic table with my feet on the bench (my son was over to the left of me, taking close up pictures of some flowers on the ground) and I was looking across Baker Lake to the other side of the lake with my binoculars. I was looking at the tree line near the shore directly across from me from left to right. Something caught my eye near a tree. It looked like a head next to one of the trees. I didn't see the whole part of a body going all the way down to the ground. I saw only the upper area of a body near the head and it seemed to be peaking out from the left side of the tree. My first thought was, it is watching the people over to the right of me swimming. I watched it for a few minutes trying to figure out if it was part of the tree, or a head with a face. I watched through my binoculars for a few minutes and sometimes would look from left to right of it and then back at it again. For a few minutes I kept seeing this head next to the tree and then I looked away and then back at it, and it was gone. That's when I realized that it was a head because it disappeared. If it was part of the tree, it would still be there. I told my son that I thought I saw a head near a tree and he didn't pay much attention to what I had said. He kept taking pictures of flowers. I can't definitely say it was a Bigfoot because I only saw a head, but a human would probably not be across the lake peaking out from the side of a tree. This didn't look like a human head. I have always had an interest in Bigfoot and I do believe they exist. Up until now I haven't seen one. My son and I thought we heard one yelling late at night back in Montana, north of Columbia falls.","Take Hwy 20 east from I5 to Concrete, WA. and then north on Baker Lake Rd.

"I was living in Whatcom County 5 minutes from the small town of Everson, WA. I worked on a dairy farm out in Custer, WA. I had to be work at 6:00 AM to feed calves, however, I did my best to get there a half-hour early just in case a cow had a calf in the night so that I could tag it, Vac it, tube it and move it before the other calves woke up for their morning feed. I got out of bed at 4 AM and got ready to go, ate a small breakfast, and left the house at 5:05 AM to head for the farm. As I started down my road I got a funny feeling. I came to a Stop sign and got ready to turn when I caught sight of movement in the headlights. At first I thought that a deer was preparing to jump over the blackberries and onto the road until I focused on what it was I was looking at. The creature blinked and reached up its hand to grasp a limb of a tree. It was sickly skinny! It’s elbow joints protruded, and I could see the clavicle bone and the shoulders had a dip between where the arm connected to the body. I could see a massive rib cage and a sickly sunken stomach on this animal. I could see the tops of this animal’s pelvic bone protruding. It had a very clear thigh gap. The sides of the head were sunken in on either side and the face was gaunt with high cheekbones. The animal leaned against the tree it was holding onto for support. I was shocked and scared, but I knew what I was seeing was real. So I tried to take in as much as I could. The animal didn’t seem too keen on moving. He just stood there staring back at my car like deer in the headlights. It was anywhere from 8’5” to 8’9” tall and about 3'6"" wide (I came back and measured a week later based on the tree branch it held on to). It was covered in dark medium length fur with patches of gray around the face and peppered throughout the body. It’s head road low to the shoulders with very little neck showing, and it’s eyes glowed yellowish greenish white in the headlights. It’s head had a high cranial ridge, making it look pin headed for lack of a better word. Its arms were very long with the fingers of the creature just above the knee. Its eyes were forward facing and quite round and deep set with a broad, protruding forehead. It’s nose was flat, with a thin lipped slightly protruding mouth like a gorilla but not as angled with the mouth. Its face had deep set wrinkles. Thinking back now I believe this poor animal didn’t have the energy to run. He just stood there staring back at me. I finally decided to turn onto the road and head to work. As I hit the gas going towards this creature he startled and bared his teeth at me. I know from documentaries that when a monkey bares it’s teeth it is a sign of aggression. The thing that struck me is that its mouth was missing a bottom canine and the rest of them were worn nearly flat. The other teeth were chipped with a few broken close to the gums and nearly gone. I hit the gas at that point because I was turning left and had to go right past this animal within about 10 to 15 feet of it. The reason I didn’t report this sooner was because I was worried how people would react, and also I wondered what this animal was doing there in the first place. After thinking it through, it hit me. There was a chicken farm in the area. I truly believe this Sasquatch was older and starving to death. It happened to be a really awful Winter, with the most snow that part of Washington had seen in 20 years, with several ice storms, and heavy snows and with temperatures plummeting into the low teens. I think it had come down from the foot hills into the town outskirts to try to snatch a few chickens as an easy meal. I think I surprised him, thinking that no humans would be out that early in the morning. A week later I saw the chicken owner while I was walking my dog. I asked how their chickens were and they told me that the week before, they believed that a few coyotes had gotten in and had snatched two of their hens that were sleeping in the outdoor shelter. There is a thick dense forest that goes on for miles straight up into the mountains. It is home to deer, black bear, coyotes, and the occasional mountain lion. I was born and raised in Montana. I hunt and fish and I have seen a lot of animals both wild and domestic. I am also a huge animal lover and have watched countless documentaries on every animal you can think of. So believe me when I say that I know animals and what I saw was not cougar nor was it a bear. I have seen them both in the wild, in zoos, and on documentaries. I would not miss identifying a bear for what I saw.",Exact location has been kept confidential in order to protect the privacy of surrounding property owners.,Whatcom County,Washington,Winter,48.90147,-122.3347,1/21/17,63451,Class A,49.55,43.245,36.94,0.82,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.
"My husbands parents, uncle and and three others bought a piece of river property in 1972.  It has been used continuously since then, mostly by Uncle.  We use it once in a while as does my SIL and her family and one other family’s grandkids.  Although the road is right next to the property, the property sits about 30’ below it in river bottom.  There is a creek at the north end of the property, about 200 feet from where our rig was parked.  That creek runs out to another creek that is part of the river and creates an island that used to be part of the property.  It is very secluded. The summer of 2018, my sister-in-law and her (adult) kids had been camping out at the property on several occasions, cleaning out trees and undergrowth, as they had bought trailers and needed to do a bit of landscaping to get their rigs in there.  My husband had a load of crushed gravel taken out there in 2009 that we used to put in the fire pit area and bolster the ground as we had a trailer at the time and needed a place to set up camp without sinking into the mud up to our axels.  We had spent almost every weekend that summer out there.  There was still quite a mound left, so SIL used that gravel to cover the area (nobody had used that area of the property on a regular basis for about 9 years at that point).  She also made a sweet little walk-way from the fire pit to one of the camp spaces about 40 feet away. On the weekend of August 18-19, 2018 we were camping at the property.  One of my step-son’s was up visiting from Texas and my husband wanted to have a BBQ for him and our daughter-in-law with the family.  We took our motorhome out to the property on Saturday afternoon and met my SIL and BIL who had gone out the night before in their rig. We stayed up talking til about 9:30PM.  Then right after dark I went into the m/h, my husband came in about 30 minutes later, his sister went into their trailer about the same time, then I heard our BIL go in about 10:15 PM.  I had a window open as it was a pretty warm night, and the shade up about 5” and their door was open, so I could hear (and see the flickering light) that he was watching a movie, as was I.  Our rigs were parked about 70’ apart with a few scraggly, leggy plants and the large fire pit area between us, but otherwise an unimpeded view. My husband had gone to bed at the back end of the M/H.  I sat up at the dinette until about 12:15am, finally deciding that I was sleepy enough to go to bed.  I closed and locked the window and the shade, made sure all the doors were locked, got into my jammys and got into bed.  My husband was sound asleep, as was our 6 month old Golden Retriever puppy.  Within 3 minutes my brain was settled enough to begin dozing off. Suddenly… Bang…Bang…Bang!!! It sounded like 2 baseball bats being slammed together, about 3 seconds apart!  It seemed like it was coming from the rivers’ edge, or closer? 60 feet, 100 feet away.  I didn’t know.  Pretty close! My eyes flew Wide open staring into the pitch black room!!  I KNEW instantly what that was!!! 15 seconds went by… nothing, so I was closing my eyes.  Then… Bang…Bang…Bang!!! It sounded like it came from up the creek, maybe a hundred yards.  I don’t really know..  on the island?  Oh Sh.., there are Two of them!!  15 more seconds went by (yes!  I was counting!!  My Navy training kicking in) Bang…Bang…Bang!!!  The closer one again. Another 15 seconds… Bang…Bang…Bang!!!  Up the creek My heart was pounding so hard, I was afraid that it might literally explode!!  Caught in the pitch black woods in my fiberglass box!!!  Are the doors lock?  Are the shades drawn?  Did I close all the windows?  Can they rip the doors open?!  Would they smash in the windows?!!!  Would the family find us dangling from tree branches tomorrow afternoon?  Did “B” hear it and shut their door?  It was so loud!  He must have heard it!!  I can’t call him, we have no cell service down in this gawd-forsaken hole!!! Next thing I know…it’s 8AM Sunday morning..  How the heck did that happen?!  After all that banging and fear I thought I would be awake all night!!  Nope, I fell right to sleep!!!  Strange thing for me to do in light of the fear and emotion running around in my little chicken brain!!!  I peaked out the windows..nothing.  Oh!  There’s my SIL sitting at the campfire. I put on a pot of coffee and walked over to visit her for a few minutes.  I asked her if she heard any noises last night.  No, she didn’t, but she sleeps like a log she said (so does her brother).  Well, that is strange.  I KNOW that happened before I fell asleep, I KNOW IT!  I had only been in bed a couple minutes.  I wasn’t even asleep yet! So, I headed back over to our rig to start breakfast.  And THERE IT WAS!!  MY PROOF!!  That I was not insane and hearing things!! Half way between the fire pit and our door, right at the edge of the little gravel walkway was a lone footprint!!  About 15” long.  About 6” wide at the ball, the dirt was mounded at the metatarsal break and the heel was square.  I had seen that same foot 17 years before, out on the sandbar, when it was only about 4” long!!!  OMG!!!  I was thrilled to pieces!!  But freaked out at the same time! I went to the rig, grabbed my cell phone and took 3 good pictures.  I’m so glad I did too!  Later that afternoon, people started showing up and I showed it to everyone.  I took my nephew over to look at it and my golden girl followed us, we were looking at the footprint, when she decided to lay right down next to it (for a tummy rub) and wiped it out with her tail!!!

"It was the second weekend in September 2018, my father and I went for a drive up Sumas mountain like we've done many times before when we decided to stop at this clear cut over looking the valley. It was about 9pm in the evening and we were scanning the clear cut with our flashlights when we first saw the eyeshine in the distance approximately 150 to 200yards. We saw 3 pairs of eye shine and at different heights thinking at first we are seeing  a mother bear and cubs but after shining our flashlights in their direction the larger creature charged up the hill along the tree line grunting and hollering then stopped and waited for the other 2.  Thats when we got our flashlights on it and it was large and brown. Then the larger one turned into the woods heading towards us breaking down branches and saplings then it just stopped and everything went silent.  As my dad and I sat there the other 2 sat on the edge of the tree line just watching us they walked around a bit but every time we made a noise they would stop what they were doing and just watched us. The eyeshine was an orangeish glow. It also seemed as if one was small cause you would see its head pop up behind stumps and logs, this went on for 3 hours. At about midnight the larger creature came out from the tree line. We got our flashlights on it.  That's when my dad and I  saw this creature step over a log and proceed to walk down hill on 2 legs and that's when the other 2 followed it. I hollered at it and you could see it turn and look at us and you could see the head bob just like when a person is walking down hill.

"Let me begin by stating that my mother Renae Sampson is a member of the BFRO and has gone on multiple expeditions, is fairly knowledgable about Bigfoot activities and sightings, and has shared her stories with me. I am somewhat of a skeptic, but believe there is always a possibility of discovering new creatures on our planet, but until this past weekend I had never experienced anything first hand. Growing up in central and western Washington, my whole family has always enjoyed the wild outdoor spaces whether camping, day hiking, fishing or just exploring old mountain dirt roads. This past weekend June 7-8, 2014 was no different... We made camp at the upper Bumping Lake campground using 2 small tents and a picnic table tent. The weather was in the upper 70's to low 80's during the day, we had 3 young children ages 4-9, and 4 adults age 37-62. (Whether that's notable or not, I don't know- but I added it in case.) My brother and his family joined us only for the day leaving around 5pm. We rode bikes, played in the water, ate lunch, hiked around the campsite on animal trails, normal camping activity with kids. One notable strange thing happened happened around 6pm... My 4 year old son needed to use the restroom and we decided to walk through the small island of trees at the end of the campsite paved loop. We startled a deer in there and I remember thinking ""that's strange to see a deer in here with so much human activity around the campsites"" I wanted to try and take a pic with my iphone and tried to walk a bit closer. My son stayed right at my heels, also being curious if we could get closer. I don't know why, but I always call wild animals ""baby"" and spoke to this deer: ""it's ok baby, we won't hurt you"" etc. (And I honestly never would, no guns or any type of weapons for my family) So we move forward, the deer slowly walking away a few feet, nibbling some leaves, me moving forward, Deer looking back at me, deer nibbling leaves, the deer never being more than 20' away from us, until we emerge from that small island of trees, cross the paved road into an empty campsite near the restrooms. It was almost as if it wanted me to follow, it kept looking back at me, but never running off. My son looks up and says, ""I don't want to follow that deer anymore, Mama"" and I try to coax him along a bit more. He was adamant and did not want to enter that part of the forest. I follow the deer a bit more trying to get that ""one great nature photo"" and then I lost the deer over a small rise. I even crouched low to see if I could spot moving legs-nothing. What is interesting about this is that my son is very outgoing, adventurous and always wants to lead the way. Was some instinct holding him back? (Whether this is notable or not, I included it anyway) After dinner, my mom, son and I went for a drive up the dirt road (1800) all the way to the end and back. Got back to camp about 9pm, made a fire, sat around and told stories, watched bats flying, watched for shooting stars. The night was calm with not much of a breeze to notice, few clouds in the sky. The moon was in its waxing gibbous phase and visible in the southern sky straight up from our campsite. I put my son to bed in our tent, then stayed up with my mom at the campfire till midnight. I simply couldn't keep my eyes open any longer and quickly fell into a deep sleep. Here's where it gets interesting and something I will never forget... Maybe its the cool night air (approx 54F) or the glass of wine before bed, but I had to wake up and go potty. As I lay trying to convince myself to get out of my warm cozy sleeping bag and don my slippers to outside behind the tent, I hear off in the far distance toward the South part of the lake a ""Clack....clack, clack, clack"" and my brain races to identify the sound. By the time I realize I am hearing rocks clacking together I hear it again, in a definite pattern ""Clack....clack, clack, clack"". Now I am wide awake, on alert and must pee now! I have to say, I did not much want to get out of my tent at this point. Nevertheless, I did, and quickly went potty behind my tent and hopped back into bed. I remember thinking ""what the hell is that?"" I grabbed my headlamp and noted the time on my watch as a few minutes past 2am. I wanted to remember this and tell my mom in the morning. I would say I listened to this clacking occurring repeatedly every couple of minutes for approx. 10 minutes and somehow fell back to sleep. Here's where it gets freaky! I'm fast asleep and become aware that there is the sound of stampeding animals right behind my tent. Still in a haze of sleep, my head on my pillow up against the wall of our tent, I feel what seem to be fingers touch the back of my head in what I can only describe as a ""hard petting"". I feel the end of my tent beyond my feet on the inflated bed my son and I are sleeping on LIFTS UP! And then its placed gently back on the ground, like floating down! I reach out to touch my son and he is facing away from me with his arms and hands under the covers. He had not touched me....what did?! I hear something brush the side of the tent! And then, I hear my mom's voice in a loud shouting whisper: ""Jennifer!!"" I am awake and alert and scared at this point and try to call out to her but my voice won't come out. I am barely able to utter a weak mumble sound.  I hear the clacking rock sound closer now, in the near distance south of our tent in the ""Clack....clack, clack, clack"" pattern, with a responding ""Clack....clack, clack, clack"" from further away maybe south-west, maybe even from the other side of the lake. And then the closer sound again this time, rapidly: ""CLACK, CLACK, CLACK, CLACK, CLACK, CLACK""  I have to tell you I was completely petrified with fear at this point, could not move or speak. Somehow, like a miracle, I fell back to sleep. Again, with that night chilly air I woke with the need to pee. I woke up thinking ""Something weird is going on here"". I could still hear the occasional clacking far off now, in the southern distance. No longer feeling petrified with fear, I don my slippers, quickly potty behind the tent again and dash back to bed. I notice the sky is still dark, full of stars and the moon positioned in the south western part of the sky right above the mountaintops. I did not check the time, but imagine it was around 4-5am. I don't remember sleeping well, filled with fright and thought ""next time we're sleeping in my Explorer"" and then it was 8am. I could hardly wait for my mom to wake so I could tell her what happened. I rose before Mom and my son and walked around our campsite looking for any sign of a visitor. No Bigfoot footprints. My tent was still firmly staked down. Couple of fresh deer tracks on the trail behind our tents. WHAT THE HECK??!! Mom woke up and I recount my story to her of the night's events. She states she was not awake at all during the night, and doesn't remember calling out my name. The funny thing about that is that I've gone by ""Jen"" for 20 years, and only my parents still call me ""Jennifer"". Weird. We pack up camp with the intent of going to the other side of the lake for a hike along the Cougar/Swamp trail for a spell before we headed home. We wanted to get to the Boulder Creek crossing and were curious if my 4 year old son could make it. He did, and we had fun taking pics along the way, had a snack break, met some folks on the trail on the way back, not too hot, not too breezy...all in all a nice day. When we were about 15 minutes away from our cars at the trailhead, we heard a sound. A sound my mom and I have never heard before. We were in a thick wooded portion of the trail: close to the water on one side, and fairly straight up elevation on the other- meaning the hillside rose steeply upwards. I do not think either of us would be able to easily climb up this land covered thickly with Kinnickinick, Bunchberry, ferns, and many many trees growing closely together. This is where the sound came from...directly above us! Hard to describe, but sounded like this: ""HUMPF"" like coming from deep within a large animal, kind of guttural, but not a growl. And it was loud. And close. And no other sounds like the animal moving or walking through this thick vegetation. We all stopped and looked at each other wide-eyed. We looked up into the woods a bit but could not see anything through the thick plant life. I was a bit on edge and thought, ""let's get out of here!"" We continued the hike back to our cars and I remember thinking to myself, ""that was weird"", and what a weird night I had just experienced and why isn't my mom talking about this more?? She's the Bigfoot fanatic in our family! Didn't she think that was strange? Maybe she was meant to forget? Or not notice? I understand Bigfoot may have powers beyond our knowledge or capabilities. You never know... So, that is my story to the best of my recollection.  It scared the hell out of me. I literally felt paralyzed. I am intrigued. I will continue to go camping, and maybe...just maybe have another encounter-if that's how you would classify this story.","OK to post online: Location was at Bumping Lake, Upper Campground site #37.

"September 14 My adult son, daughter and her son and I all hiked into Twin Sisters Lakes from the Deep Creek Campground around 1 1/2 to 2 miles. My son and were planning to spend 2 nights and daughter and her son, just for the day. We set up camp, ate lunch and just enjoyed the day at the lake and surrounding area. Many hunters were leaving due to it being the last day of Bow season for Elk so we watched them being packed out by Mules and Horses. Beautiful day in the low 80's I would say. My daughter and her son left around 3:30 so it was just my son and I and the 2 dogs. He fly fished and I just relaxed and read at camp. At dusk we started a fire, ate and had a glass of wine.  I did a couple wood knocks but did not hear a response. Around 9:00 we went to our tents with a dog in each for the night. At 1:30 in the morning the dogs needed out to do their business so we did also then back to bed. My son snores terribly so my sleeping was intermittent. Our tents were between two trees about 8 feet apart and a foot from each other and the trees. I awoke sometime in the night and raised up because I heard the dog moving around. He was staring out the window towards the Lake. He did this several times that night, didn't bark or growl. I heard nothing that night except my son and the dogs snoring. September 15 Awoke early and we decided to take a hike to Blankenship Lakes and Meadow. Spooked a Rough Grouse on the way and met 2 Bow Hunters on the trail. They had no luck but said where they were camped at Blankenship was busy with coyotes during the previous night. When we reached the Lake one of the dogs Maggie would not leave Bob's side so we continued on. Got back to camp around noon. When dusk arrived we made a fire and I decided to do a call, one loud Whoop and immediately across the lake we got a return whoop and Elk on both sides of the lake started bugling back and forth to each other. Also a coyote yip then it was quiet for awhile and then more Elk bugles and a loud knock on the hill behind our tents. By this time my son was wide eyed and couldn't believe what he was hearing. I had told him of all of my expeditions and reports from others so he was a believer but had never experienced it for himself. We decided to go to bed and he immediately went to sleep snoring right away. I on the other hand was awake and listening when I felt something heavy stepping on the side of my tent where my arm was lying , I slowly moved my arm not making a sound because I didn't want whatever it was to know I wasn't sleeping. I felt my head being pushed down also as it went by and a loud swoosh on the tent fly. I was petrified and tried to call out ""Go Away"" but nothing came out. I was mute, but continued to try and say something to wake my son up. He and both dogs were snoring. After it passed my tent I continued to hear soft bipedal footfalls around our camp. I did not sleep all night. Around dawn I heard another wood knock. We got up , packed up and left. Very memorable trip for us, shook me up but I still want to have a sighting and will keep doing this.

"My friend and I rode snowmobiles about 8 miles into a wilderness area. No one had been in the are for at least 2 days because previous tracks were covered by Saturdays storm. We turned off the main road and onto a side road and rode a few hundred feet before we stopped at a bridge crossing a stream. As soon as we took off our helmets we heard a loud howl/moan sound that lasted 8-10 seconds. We looked at each other in shock. Another howl followed about 8 seconds behind it and then we head a loud bang on a tree in the opposite direction. It was like a super loud woodpecker just pecked once. A few seconds after we heard a large tree branch break in the direction of the howl and then heard a third howl. Two more loud wood pecker sounds then followed with about 5 seconds in between. The scream seemed like it was from a mile away, but in the dense trees it was likely much closer. The wood noises and loud break sounded like they were within 50 yards or so. Then it was silent for about 5 minutes and we started to get ready to leave and the howls started again, but seemed like they were twice as far away. After about 6 more howls with 5 seconds or so in between, we decided to leave the area. Neither of us have ever heard anything like it. It seemed like it had an amplifier and we were the only people within about a 8 mile radius. I listened to the ""Ohio howl"" and it was close but longer and more fluctuation in some of the moans.",We parked at Fish Creek Snowpark at Lake Rimrock. Followed the 1000 road to the 1070 road.

Heard at least four howls in the morning between 4-5 am at silver beach camp grounds. The sounds were about a mile away but could here clearly in the morning. Thought was wild life or maybe a person. Then looked up a video on YouTube of people using a parabolic sound dish recording Sasquatch vocalizing sounds when I arrived back home. Was able to recognize the sounds from the video to what I had heard. It was a terrifying sound. The best way to describe it was a howl sound between a man and a ape.

"Wanted to pass this by you as I was out duck hunting today (10/17/21) in north central Wisconsin… Powell Marsh area to be exact. This is a very remote marsh area surrounded by hundreds of thousands of acres of state and National forests.  You can access this marsh zone via paths the DNR has to maintain Water levels and people do watch migratory birds from a couple observation areas along road. I was more on a walk with the potential to jump shoot some puddle ducks as you can see not a cloud around.  Nor were there ducks. Not even sure it is a sighting but seemed rather strange. Something told me to look behind me as I was going the opposite direction as the figure. After watching this object for a couple hundred yards I decided to grab my cell phone. It is a long way away but appears black, large, and fast.  We have bear, very few moose, wolves, and occasional Elk around.  Feel free to say it is a guy on a bike-riding in the peat moss, or a guy on a 4 wheeler in a prohibited motorized vehicle area. It appears to be bipedal and walking deeper into the swamp in the muck. It is hunting season and I wouldn’t expect a person to be dressed in all black in a public hunting area.  I tried walking in it and turned back after about 5 feet. With naked eye I could see much better. The figure seemed to float as it moved across the swamp. Again a guy on a bike? After my hunt, I returned to the only 2 access areas to see if there were vehicles with bike racks or people out for a peat bog run. There was nobody around. I have been to the Marsh countless times and have never seen something like this. Although the distance a bit far for video. Figure seems quite large. Clearly appears to be in muck. I have photos and video but iPhone is a long way away and i am not an editing expert.  I am sure video can be manipulated and enhanced. ——————————— [Further comments provide when he sent in the photos: “ Here are pics. Was hunting ducks in Powell Marsh, Wisconsin.

"My father and I went to Loew Lake because I had heard there had been sasquatch activity in the area. We hiked the trails for about two hours without much luck finding anything. I did find tree structures near the area where hunting is prohibited, and I took a picture of each of the two potential tree structures we had found. So as we were heading back to our car after hiking for two hours, I decided to pick up a stick and try making some wood knocks. To our surprise, there was a response. Mind you, we had been hearing gunshots in the area, local wildlife, and the sounds of trees scraping against each other. And what we heard was a knocking noise we couldn't explain. I knocked once, and we heard a knock in reply. Then I knocked in a series of three, and we got a three knocked response. Then, the knocks started going rapid one after another. I then replied in the same fashion, knocking rapidly one after another. Then it stopped. I made several attempts later to try tree knocking again in hopes of getting a response again, but no luck. I had the idea that if it was a sasquatch, it figured out it wasn't communicating with another Sasquatch so it stopped replying. My dad and I both heard it and decided that it could have only been either another human being messing with us or it was in fact a sasquatch. This makes me want to look into the area more. Because we never heard that noise until I started tree knocking the first time. And then never heard the noise again. We ruled out the idea that is was just a wood pecker, because wood peckers make noise whenever they want and not really in reply to something. To my knowledge, nothing in our area in terms of animals could make a knocking noise such as that.",On the trail by the St Augustine parking area.

My son reported seeing a two legged large figure covered in fur at approximately 8:30pm on July 18 2021 while driving eastbound on Pleasant Hill road roughly 1.5 miles west of Hwy 164 in Richfield WI. This figure was standing right next to a tree on the south side of the road close to the shoulder.  The road is curvy in this area.  He said he also caught eye shine and the eyes were large.  We said he probably saw this for about 3 seconds while driving.  His headlights caught this and he is 100% positive he saw something.  He said his heart dropped and he immediately called me while still driving.  I knew something unique happened based on his demeanor and tone. About 45 minutes after he called me I met him at home and went back to the site with him. We brought our dog.

"I am writing this report for a family member of mine. The witness to the bigfoot was driving in her vehicle on her way home from work. The route she takes is all country back roads. She was going up a hill with her brights on and notices something was hiding behind a tree on the left side of the road. So she slowed down and it looked around the tree right at her and then poked back into hiding.The witness stated that it was very tall over 6ft tall and had red eyes and a man like face. The witness remembers going through her head questioning what it could have been and soon realized it was something, she had never believed in a bigfoot. She couldn't get over small little details from the little she seen of it. The height, color of eyes, and the way the eyes were set on the face, so human like, unlike an animal, and the face it self more flat like a human not pointy like a deer or bear.

"My wife and I spent all summer camping at the thousand trails resort in Plain WA.On the night of September 22 2012, we were spending time out by the camp fire. The campground was mostly empty. This is a very large campground 18 miles west of Leavenworth WA. It was around 11:30PM at night. We were drinking coffee and enjoying the warm starlit evening. I noticed a very strong sulfur musty smell. My wife said, ""Do you smell that?"" I told her that I did. In my 40 years of being in the northwest woods I have never smelled anything like it. In a few minutes, a medium piece of wood came flying into the camp. This piece of wood hit our trailer and bounced off it, and landed on our wood pile. We both were in shock. My wife said,  ""What the hell was that!?"" We both looked at each other and said, "" You don't think it was you know who?"" The smell left, but in a few minutes it came back. I asked my wife where my NIKON was. It was at this point that a rock came flying into camp. There were major fires all around us at the time.

"June 22, 2014 While on a dirt bike riding trip with three friends we came to an intersection of two dirt roads about 7 miles north of Plain, WA.

We initially didn't think much of it as we were not familiar with the immediate area and assumed that there were people near by.  Two of us walked closer to the intersection to see if there were other motorcycles or vehicles parked down the road. We found none.

Two bear had been sighted up the trail at Lake Ann itself, but we didn't see them. We ran into two other hikers just after the exchange. They had also heard it and thought it strange.

"My name is Niels Nelson.  I stay/live in a travel trailer at Thousand Trails Leavenworth, WA. However the resort is 18 miles away from Leavenworth outside of Plain, WA. I was awakened by a sound... No clue what woke me but with it being Memorial Day weekend and many in the campground I just assumed it was someone being loud and and it woke me. I didn't really hear what woke me so laid my head back down on the pillow and about 3 minutes later I heard something but I was awake and sat up in bed and listened.

I said to myself nah it must be some humans partying or yelling at a cabin on a hill, or in another section of the campground. Then within another 30 seconds another one while I was still sitting up, head by the open window, and complete darkness, no other human noise, quiet time and all are sleeping, and no human could make this noise as we simply cannot transmit what I will call depth and broadness of that kind of distance. It felt like it was coming from miles away but it wasn't directional. This howl could pentrate walls or obstructions it felt like. This was beyond weird, unsettling, while still kinda exciting. Anyhow, that is what I heard.",Leavenworth Thousand Trails Plain Valley on 1 side and Lake Wenatchee and the SnowPark surrounding on the other.,Chelan County,Washington,Spring,47.79538,-120.6295,5/31/21,69270,Class B,80.69,67.89,55.09,0.71,Partly cloudy throughout the day.
"At 3:45 in the morning on Shi Shi Beach N., myself and two other backpackers woke up to the sounds of my dog running after something. The dog ran 50 feet away from our sleeping site on the beach to the ridge that separated the N and lower beaches. There were sounds of grappling/contact between my dog and the animal. I thought it was a raccoon that my dog had attacked but when I ran to the area underneath the ridge I saw an enormous figure in the dark. The first words to come out of my mouth were ""identify yourself!"" The figure made no growling sound, no sound as it moved, and had no backpack or headlamp. I think it kicked the dog to get away from it. After my friend comes up behind me and grabs the dog somehow, I manage to find the headlamp after 5 minutes. Before we can turn it on and look at the ridge, my friend looks over my shoulder and sees a human figure/torso approach the top of the ridge, set its hand down on a large rock next to it, and then disappear. He remarked about the size of its arms in comparison to the rest of its body. During the initial struggle, my friend also notes a sound he heard. It was an elk-like horn sound that was similar to moaning. I didn't feel like the sound was directed at me but we were in a cove and the figure was fleeing - sounds bounce around. My friend also suggested the idea that the figure ran UP the ridge at a 35 degree angle which is not possible for a human. I convinced myself that it was a human assailant coming to steal our backpacking gear... Yet the figure did not identify itself, was not wearing a headlamp, and somehow scaled the cliff in pitch black. By far the creepiest backpacking experience I have ever had.","Directions to the site: Drive through Neah Bay on the Makah Reservation and continue down towards the trailhead (near the fish hatchery).

"My three friends and fellow soldiers recently spent a three day camping trip into Olympic National Forest Elwha River Trail. We had to return to cell coverage, so myself and my buddy headed out of the forest and north on the main trailhead. The night before was a heavy thunder storm so the trail was very muddy. I was a leading us out and stumbled upon a very clear muddy print of a left foot. I wear a size 11 mens boot and to me this was clearly a size 14-15. The print seemed recent and had clearly defined toes and arch. We only had a cellphone to take the picture with and regrettably only took the one. The tracks, that seemed to be from the same source (none as clearly defined), went on heading north on the trail an additional 25-30 feet. That night we decided it was in our best interest with the horrible weather to make camp at one of the historical cabins on the trail. We retrofitted a poncho in one of the open windows to shelter us from the rain and wind. We secured it by weighing the bottom half down with a 2x2 piece of wood. During the heaviest gusts of wind it seemed to hold up. At approx 0100 hrs the tarp was opened and something knocked the piece of wood onto one of my fellow campers. Being woken up by this, I saw the tarp movement with no wind source being observed.  These events could have easily been a bear...  I do note, however, that the large garbage bag that was littered with foodstuff was untouched throughout the night. I include these occurrences to make sure and give you a thorough recording of events substantial or not.",About a mile and a half into the Elwha River Trail.,Clallam County,Washington,Winter,47.94485,-123.5436,1/16/11,28739,Class B,50.14,46.795,43.45,0.39,Light rain until afternoon.

"I was accompanied by my wife and 15-yo son. We has built a fire and when the sun had set I mentioned to my wife that Sasquatch's are known to answer howls. I am on the BFRO site 4-days a week to track sightings and am a firm believer after reading Dr. Meldrum's book: Sasquatch-Legend Meets Science. I made a howl like the 1994 Moaning Howl Ohio call recording on this site. I am a trained vocalist and can project my voice loudly. I cupped my face and let out a howl. Its was answered. I was facing east and let out a howl every 30-60 seconds that was answered progressively closer. Astonished, I kept it up and the return was always closer. My wife fled to into the RV in fear. My son would not come out. I was not in fear but in hopes of seeing a Sasquatch. I did not have my cell phone with me to record the sasquatch returning howls. I grabbed my .44 magnum revolver (just in case) and a flashlight scanning the trees in hopes to see a illuminated red pair of eyes. As soon as I had my pistol in my hand there were no more returning howls. I was never in fear but in awe. There must have been 10-12 howls and returns. With the first reply. I would guess that the Sasquatch at least a mile away and with the last, maybe a 1/4 to an 1/8 of a mile if not closer. On 6/30/2020, we returned home and I had my wife and son listed to the 1994 Ohio howls. They were shocked that that was what they had heard.","On June 22, 2020; I was parked just outside the Swan Bay launch site at Ozette Lake on a logging road.

"My wife and I were driving late in the night trying to reach the Coldwater Creek Campground near Yacolt. By the time we got there the campground was full. We kept driving and stopped at the first logging road that had a suitably flat spot for camping (we sleep in the back of our SUV). It was a short dead end logging road in a recovering clear-cut. We set up camp and went to sleep. Around 2:30 a.m. my wife awoke to our pet rabbit scrambling around in the driver's footwell. The rabbit had gotten down there and couldn't get back up. As my wife reached up there to rescue the bunny, she felt something firmly touch her leg. She described it as a firm press and then deliberate, downward motion. At first she was confused because we were inside the car, but then she remembered that we kept the sliding rear windows open slightly for ventilation. The spot where she was touched was pressed against that opening (we built a sleeping platform in our car that puts us near the level of the windows). She heard nothing super obvious, but immediately afterward she thinks she heard a couple of extremely light footfalls. We stayed mostly silent for about an hour, just listening for anything, but heard nothing else. I finally mustered the courage to peek out a window, but couldn't see anything. The next morning we found very large, muddy fingerprints on our car, near where my wife was touched. We have pictures of these prints which we would be glad to submit. In the photos you can see where I tried to recreate the prints with my own fingers. I have medium sized hands and the prints are MUCH larger. We looked around a bit taking note of things. On my wife's side of the car was only a fairly narrow strip of road, and after that was dry, crunchy grass and brush. Whatever touched her had to be able to walk along that narrow strip, otherwise we would have heard it in the dry brush. It also had to be tall enough to reach the window. We feel these factors probably rule out four-legged animals. We considered the idea that a person could have been messing with us, but there are some issues with that which make us skeptical. First, we feel a person wouldn't have been so quiet. Second, we find it hard to believe someone trying to scare us would have simply touched her leg, left prints, and called it good. More than likely a person would have taken things farther than that. That would really be showing a lot of restraint for a prankster.  Last, the prints would have been a VERY large person. One who also though to get their hands muddy beforehand.

"I was near Toutle driving home around midnight. A creature on its hands and knees, furry and brown, was in the middle of the road. This creature was about the size of a 10 year old child and resembled an ape. I swerved to miss the creature, and was stunned about what I just saw. My roommate was with me and confirmed she had seen the same thing. We looked back to see if the creature was still there, and there was nothing. I was a non-believer until this incident.","Heading west on 504, right outside of Toutle.",Cowlitz County,Washington,Summer,46.32793,-122.4349,6/1/14,49092,Class A,66.6,57.735,48.87,0.14,Partly cloudy throughout the day.
"I was elk hunting this past week in the Mt. Adams and Mt Saint Helens areas. I headed up on a hike on Wed. the 23rd of September at a place called Spencer Butte. It's located Outside of Cougar and is a steep hike of 1800 elevation gain (it sits about 4300 ft). My friends and I headed up the hill in the morning at about 8:30 am. The weather was very rainy. We were trying to be very observant of any sounds or tracks. About half way up the mountain my friend turns to me and says 'did you hear that? it sounds like people yelling' I listened for a moment and heard what I would describe as a distant yowl...far up the trail. It was faint but distinct. We continued up the trail and eventually reached the top. My guess is it was about 10 am. Once we had reached the geological marker at the top, my friend and I began a search splitting directions. I continued through the trees and brush for about 75 yards from the geological marker and came to a clearing. I sat for a few moments and noticed that beyond the clearing...roughly another 35 yards or so was an alder that was shaking. I could just see the top of it, but there wasn't wind at the time and it was shaking intermittently. It happened several times. I thought I had an animal...possibly an elk pushing against the tree. I approached it and paused as I could hear something begin to move away. I then backtracked...grabbed my friend and he followed me over to the area. We proceeded to move around the area on either side hoping to see what it was. It was gone...Once I got to the tree I was surprised by how big the trunk was. Something big must of moved it. We split up again and I went back the way I came. As I was walking I came across a bit of mud and gravel. I noticed something very distinct. A Print. It was a left foot. I could see all of the toe outlines and it was much much bigger than my foot. I took a picture with my phone. We didn't have any other incidents but that sound, tree shaking and print are very compelling evidence. The location was also very compelling. The print was well away from the initial trail and geological marker. I have always been a believer, My grandfather researched and searched for bigfoot and before he died gave me his plaster cast from California. On another note, A few months ago had a very strange early morning (2:30 am) whistling experience, with eye shine earlier, movement and a dog that was very wary (but fearful) of something in the back woods near my house. I live in the Jim Creek area in Arlington, Wa. I can share more on that at a later date if interested.","Trail head - Co-ordinates: 46.1725, -121.9305",Cowlitz County,Washington,Fall,46.1725,-121.9305,9/23/20,66120,Class B,55.14,50.995,46.85,0.25,Heavy rain throughout the day.

"My husband was driving while we were heading north up the WA coast from our little town of Ocean Shores to Moclips, for me to shoot some photos.  I keep my cameras handy while we are driving almost anywhere out of our town.  I like to shoot candid photos of the sights we see. On June 2, 2012, we reached a curve just south of Seabrook (a newly built, planned community).  My husband pulled over and I turned to look up at the rather bare fir trees standing on the top of the ridge on the east side of the coast road.  I always enjoy looking at those weather bleached trees and have captured their a number of times.  When my eyes moved down to the lower part of the trees, just uphill from our parking spot, I saw a head and shoulder-like shape standing between two trees.  The brush on the hillside hide all but the head and top of part of the shoulder shapes...  I quickly reached for my 'ready to shoot' camera, with its 70-300mm tele-lens, but by the time I aimed the camera at that spot...the head/shoulder shape was no longer 'there'.  I told my husband what I'd just seen...but he didn't seem too impressed. So, I stepped out of our SUV to shoot some photos looking downhill and out over the beach below our rather high vantage point.  I shot several, including some of wildflowers blooming nearby my husband's driver-side door.  When I was about to walk back around the car to get into it...a sudden loud noise struck nearby.  I immediately looked toward the wide-metal guard-rail, since the loud noise sounded like a heavy stone hitting metal...leaving a vibrating sound. I saw no stones on the paved parking area...but a stone could have skipped over into the grass and brush just beyond the railing. I don't know what caused that loud noise...but it was unnerving enough for my husband, who does have a hearing problem, to suddenly tell me to get back into the car.  He had heard it also. While first parked in that area...we had also seen a large pickup truck suddenly stop just below us right on the curve of the highway...while it was traveling north, as had we been just minutes earlier.  The truck was not sitting in a safe place...it we noted that it made no sense for it to stop in such a blind-spot on a curved in a busy roadway...  The truck had then moved forward 20 to 30 ft. and then suddenly stopped a second time...and hesitated for several seconds before starting on its way once more.  Later...my husband and I speculated that the truck might also have been struck by a rock/stone thrown from that same hillside... Our rock incident was the second one I know of that occurred within the same week...  I had been told about and shown the broken windshield on a lady's car just days earlier...when a rock had been hurled up, over and out of heavy brush while she drove alone to Aberdeen, Wa from Ocean Shores...passing a swampy area near the Humptulips River.

"Sept 30, 2013. Route 109 halfway between Hoquiam/Aberdeen and Ocean Shores Washington. I was driving back from Hoquiam to Ocean Shores where I live when a deer ran across the road heading south about an eighth of a mile ahead of me.  From experience I know that if one deer crosses the road there is a good chance that another is right behind it and so I slowed way down.  Instead of a deer, here comes this guy that makes it across the road in three strides at a dead run.  I came to a complete stop, somewhat in shock...like ""what the HELL am I looking at?"" This guy (yup it was a male, no question about that..)stops at the top of the roadside berm, turns around and looks right at me.  He gave me a grin that was CLEARLY a threat, turned back around and vanished into the roadside brush. So I got to see a Sasquatch up close and personal.  My window was down and I was no more than 20 feet from him.  His face was human looking except that he had no chin and he had a somewhat heavy brow ridge.  The nose was a human nose and was more european than african looking.  The eyes were black, the skin was grey as was his hair and he had more or less human teeth...what was left of them.  His teeth were in terrible condition.  When he ran, his palms were down, not thumbs up like us, and when he stood his palms faced back rather than thumbs forward like a person.  The arms looked a bit longer than a human but not more than half a hand length longer.  Also since it was around one in the afternoon and I was looking south at him I could see the shape of his head through the hair in the sun.  The hair sticks way up and makes him look like he has a pointy head but really the shape of the head is human.  My guess and it is only a guess,  is that he was about 7-8 feet tall.

"I went out to get a couple empty plant pots located at the north corner of my house. I had some stacked up in a box. To the north and behind my house, the neighbors dog was barking like crazy from inside their fenced off back yard... There's thick barrier of brush between me and the next lot facing west so I couldn't really see the dog. I grabbed the two small pots and stood up and yelled at the dog to ""shut up"" just then the bushes in front of me started thrashing like crazy and deep growl/grunt/exhale emanated from behind them. It was surreal as sound seemed to penetrate right through me, whatever it was, it wasn't happy. Instinctively, I started to cover the distance to my shed about 35 feet and while I was on my way, I could feel/hear the ground pounding as ""whatever"" was moving for cover in the brush to the south. It was like ""boom, boom, boom, boom then it crashed into the woods and there was loud sound of sticks/branches breaking... I ducked to the shed and just stood there, confused as to what just happened. I waited for what seemed to be a few minutes, grabbed a sledge hammer for some protection and was just about to make a break for the house, when the bushes and branches behind the shed started snapping, again; it was like a buffalo was charging through them... So, I stayed put and I was getting kind of freaked out. Then there was silence for a few minutes and I made the dash for the house. Once inside I grabbed my Mossberg 500 loaded with ""00"" buckshot and headed back out on my back deck. There was nothing to see and even the dog was quiet... I thought about looking for tracks but, I reasoned it out that whatever could make the ground shake like that would be best left alone. I'm a cautious person by nature. I would have chaulked this up to maybe being a bear except for the pounding foot steps that shook the ground... I've had bear run past me before in this yard as I've been here for 19 years. There was no tell tale Squatch smell as the wind was blowing from the South West... However, two days later, there was a horrible musky skunk smell coming through my bedroom window.

"November elk hunting in the Colonel Bob Wilderness in the Olympic National Forest. First day of modern elk season, high above the Humtulips River area. As I was setting up my truck tent for the night on a remote spur road I heard what I believed to be elk movement in the gulley/ravine below me. The area is a good elk hunting location and I have had success there in the past. It was too dark at the point to pursue any bull so I decided to make a cup of coffee, fire up my lantern and do a little reading before crawling into my truck tent for the night. It was a few minutes after I sat down that I heard a tree in the high timber above me being moved. It sounded like it was being pushed or shoved until it crashed to the forest floor. I am familiar with timber and have spent my entire life running chainsaws and around logging. The tree was large and there was no wind or weather. So I rationalized it as just a weakened tree in the forest that possibly a bear or other large mammal just happened to rub against until it came down. But what happened next unnerved me unlike anything I have ever experienced. About five minutes after the tree incident, I head extremely loud limbs breaking, like fir or hemlock limbs literally being snapped from a tree. The echo of this resonating through the deep timber and deep into the ravine below me. It seemed to be around 100-120 yards above me to my north. Then I heard the same thing in the ravine below me, and another smaller tree snapping and crashed. Then I heard a very odd sound. I have tried to describe it to my family and all I can compare it to is almost a primate like sound, and it echoed through the timber. At this point I packed up and drove the 7.5 miles back out to the gravel forest service road. I have never been as unnerved as I was. I had the overwhelming sense of being surrounded, and could not rationalize what I had encountered. I have spent my entire life hunting and camping in the backcountry of Washington and Oregon.

"Last month I went on a backpacking trip in the Buckhorn Wilderness, to a small alpine lake about two hours into the wilderness; called Lena Lake. I went with my mother and we accompanied a group of people on this two day backpacking trip. When we got to the lake everyone set camp and it was time to start preparing dinner. I went down to the shore of the lake to explore while everyone was at camp. When I got there I was surprised to see tons of barefoot tracks everywhere. But what caught my attention was how these tracks were so unusual, they did not look like some random people were walking around barefoot in the mud. It wasn't exactly the size of them that caught my attention but how deep they were in the mud. Whatever it was must of been at least around 200-300 pounds or more because I'm around 130 pounds and jumped as hard as I possibly could in the mud, and I barely made an indent. Whereas the prints I was looking at were around 4 to 5 inches deep. Also what struck my attention was the raised area of the foot. I looked up Bigfoot footprints online and they described it as the mid-tarsal break. All of the footprints I was looking at by the lake had a mid-tarsal break. I looked up photos of Bigfoot tracks and one of mine looked very similar to the track photographed in the Hoh Rainforest in 2005. All the tracks seemed to come from a family, for some were very small and others were larger. The tracks lead into the water and out from another shore of a shallow part of the lake and I followed them up into the gravel as they disappeared into some boulders and large rocks by the lake. I couldn't understand how people would walk around barefoot in the rock and gravel especially when it was a very cold time of the year. The tracks looked about a few days old because I could tell they weren't fresh, but they were so unusual and looked so like the ones online that my instincts told me that these were not human footprints.","Lena Lake, Buckhorn wilderness.",Jefferson County,Washington,Fall,47.61922,-123.1592,9/21/13,42304,Class B,56.48,52.11,47.74,0.58,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.
"There were six of us camping up on the Mt Jupiter Road in between the Dosewallups and the Duckabush rivers on labor day weekend, on saturday morning about 4:00am Ken heard a loud roar, just over the hill and down at the creek bed 500 yards from camp. on Saturday night their were six of us around the camp fire and heard the same roar as from Saturday morning, I told everybody that vocalization is from bigfoot, so we stayed up for a while longer and went to sleep in our tents at about 10:30pm.

"My name is Tim. My wife Nan and I live between Newberg and Wilsonville, OR. On February 24, 2016 we decided to take a couple of days off and drive up to the Olympic Peninsula. We drove up to Olympia, WA and took Hwy 101 route along the Hood Canal to through Port Angeles to Forks, where we stayed the night at the Forks Motel. Early on the morning of February 25th (a Thursday) we drove south on Hwy 101 to Upper Hoh Road and east to the Hoh Rain Forest. It was a beautiful clear and dry day, which was unusual for February on the Peninsula. After an enjoyable walk through the Rain Forest we headed back west on Upper Hoh Road. There was very little traffic in either direction and we pretty much had the road to ourselves. Approximately halfway back to Hwy 101, where the road once again comes close to the Hoh River, we had just cleared a corner and were at the beginning of a straight stretch of road which I estimate to be about 1/4-mile long before there was a left-hand corner. At the end of that straight stretch we both saw a very large bipedal creature walk out of the woods on the north side of the road, stride across the road in three strides, and disappear into the woods on the south side of the road. It appeared to be 7-8' tall and covered in dark hair. We both looked at each other in astonishment with that ""Did you see what I just saw?"" look on our faces. Without making comment of my own I asked Nan to describe what she had just seen, and her description was exactly the same as mine. When we got to that spot where we had seen the creature appear from the woods we stopped and examined the site. The road was in an area that was still within the Olympic National Forest, and the woods were so thick on each side of the road that it was difficult to see more than a few feet into the woods to the north. The trees were just as thick on the south side of the road, but we could tell that we were very close to the Hoh River. There was no trail whatsoever coming out of the woods or going into the woods on the south side of the road. Under the circumstances we could only surmise that we had just seen a Bigfoot that was apparently going across the road to reach the river. Even though I never doubted the existence of Bigfoot, I always considered myself a ""Professional Skeptic"". Yes it most certainly could exist, especially here in the Pacific Northwest where there are still enormous tracts of land that are virtually unexplored, but I would prefer to see proof of it myself prior to confirmation. I am now a confirmed believer, as is Nan. We never told anyone about it, and it wasn't until last night when we were watching a rerun of your show where you did an investigation in the Olympic Rainforest that we were reminded of the event. After the show we decided that I should send an email to you to apprise you of our sighting.",The sighting occurred approximately 6.7 miles east of Hwy 101 (according to Streets 'n Trips).,Jefferson County,Washington,Winter,47.82243,-124.195,2/25/17,57781,Class A,41.62,37.805,33.99,0.97,Foggy overnight.
"On August 20, 2020 in the evening about 8:10pm my girlfriend and I were in my truck heading to Collins Camp site in the ‘The Brothers Wilderness’ Olympic National Forest to camp for 4 days with my girlfriend’s sister and a few friends. We were on  WA- 104 NE and came up to the Center Loop mid-point to get on Center Rd to head to the camp site. We made a right turn on to Center Rd but it curves south under highway and driving for just a few minutes and coming out of a long curve to a long straightway, approaching mile marker (#3) moments passing side road called Dabob Road, a rock no bigger than a small apple came flying out of the tree line and hit my truck on the top of the hood near the passenger windshield wiper. I wanted to stop and get out investigate but my girlfriend was a bit nervous about stopping and did not want to stop. We continued to drive to our destination for a minute or two to process what just happened to us. Then we both spoke the word,  “Bigfoot”!  We both have no doubt in our minds that it was a Bigfoot that threw the rock. We believed it was not likely any kids throwing rocks due to the remoteness of the area or any close houses. The rock did not tumble off a cliff or hillside because the area was flat and due to the trajectory and speed of the rock, it came right at us. My girlfriend told me she saw something big and black at the tree line just before the rock hit. I did not see anything only the rock as it hit my truck. We both know the Olympics has tons of Bigfoot reports so I would not any doubt it was a Bigfoot that threw the rock. We pulled in to a gas station at 15 minutes later to get gas and I took a picture with my cell phone of the damage. We noticed an approximately (1) one inch chunk of paint missing where the rock hit. All the way to the campsite and for the next few days the thought of a Bigfoot throwing a rock and hitting my truck never left my mind and we continued to talk about it a lot. At some point in the near future I want to place a few game cameras back in the area just to see if I get lucky. There is no doubt in my mind that we had a Bigfoot experience.",Take Interstate (5) North Seattle to (Edmonds-Kingston) Ferry exit- take Ferry to Kingston.

Last night my girlfriend and I were awoke by a very disturbing howl outside (1:30 am). We normally sleep with the bedroom window open since we like the sound of the rain and wind at night.  We heard the howl four times and could hear it echo throughout the area.  This morning we reached the sound we heard and discovered it was what has been previously reported as a Bigfoot vocalization.,,King County,Washington,Spring,47.34072,-122.0775,5/2/14,44946,Class B,67.38,58.14,48.9,0.12,Mostly cloudy starting in the afternoon.
"I was hiking at Little Si in Washington State with a friend who was visiting from out of town. It was pouring rain so we left our phones but we went anyway and started our hike sometime in the morning. We got to an interesting little part off the trail where a little waterfall was pouring off from a cliff above, maybe like 20 feet up. We turned back after that spot and started heading back but while we were walking we heard what I first thought was an alarm, but it sounded organic. At the end of the “alarm” was a very strange vocalization like an ape mixed with human. The alarm sound happened over 10 times and at the end of each sustained holler was the strange vocalization. After the second or third alarm sound and vocalization I started making the sounds back to whatever it was. My friend and I both listened intently trying to identify what the sound could possibly be. We ruled out human right away because whatever was making that sound had a huge lung capacity and we both immediately knew it couldn’t be human. As we listened, and I kept responding, the way the mouth moved made us also rule out a wolf or coyote. It sounded like it had lips...I know that sounds strange but we both said whatever was making the sound had a mouth like a human or ape. I responded three or four times before I realized what else it could possibly be. “Amy, we gotta go. NOW” I said. She asked why and I said, “I think I’m hitting on a Sasquatch. We have to get the hell out of here.” I know I’m making it sound like a joke, but I grew up hearing about Sasquatch stories and I never thought they could be actually real. So I was a little joking when I told her I was hitting on a Sasquatch but the sound was so large, reverberating through the mountainside, I also thought whatever that is sounds like it’s getting closer and the only thing it could possibly be, however unlikely, was a large beast with lips like a human or ape. So, we ran. We ran the rest of the way down the trail and got to the car where our phones were. We didn’t see anyone else on the trail. When we got our phones out I googled Pacific Northwest wildlife sounds to try and find out what it “really” was. We looked up wolf, coyote, elk, and anything else we could think of. So I finally said, “We have to look up Bigfoot sounds...it’s the only thing left.” She looked at me and nodded. She didn’t grow up hearing any stories of Bigfoot because she is from the Midwest. I found a few recordings and immediately the hair on our arms and neck stood straight up. This was 5 years ago but just writing this I’m getting goosebumps all over again. I was at an art sale today in Leavenworth and a man was selling art. We bought a painting with a Sasquatch standing behind a tent and it reminded me of this story. That artist doesn’t really know much about Sasquatch but said since painting them he’s heard countless first hand stories from people out there and so I shared mine with him. It made me want to see if there was anyone else who would want to know, and my brother sent me here. Anyway, thanks. It feels good to get this experience out to the right people. I’m still skeptical but cannot deny what I heard, and I still have no explanation for it. The vocalization  I heard was very similar to the Sierra recordings (forgot the name of the guy who recorded them) but the sustained big barreled “alarm” with the sounds at the end was a bit different than those recordings. I was going to change the date because it happened on October 31st, and I thought no one would believe me. But it is what it is. Also, we were so freaked out that I left a note warning other campers and made an email address asking if anyone else heard it, to contact me. No one has (I haven’t checked it in years, however).",I have the exact location of when we first heard it. It was by the little cove area on the trail.

"Me and two other friends were up exploring this logging road near North Bend. We have herd about some weird things and encounters up there so we decided that we were gonna go see what was out there. I can't say I was expecting anything to happen but I was open to the idea of it. As we were driving up, we pulled off and were walking around on a game trail. I located an interesting footprint. I was able to make out toes on the print but I was unable to determine any other features since the print looks a few weeks old but still got a picture (which I still have). So we continued on. We found a road that was washed out so we went on foot about 2 miles in. We first went about half a mile in when all of a sudden a rock was thrown over our heads and landed in front of me. We thought it was very strange and a little creepy. We had some guns which in a way comforted us that we had some sort of protection. So we decided to keep moving. As we walked down this road, we kept hearing movement along the way. We had the feeling that we were being watched. Eventually it started to get dark so we start back to the truck and as we turned around another rock was thrown from behind, landing in front of us. We were very worried and my friend shot 3 warning shots into the air. We started speed walking back and continued to hear movement in the trees. We got back to the truck and got out of there. When we got almost back to pavement, we pulled off and just relaxed. It was night by this time and we were all in the truck. After a few minutes we started hearing movement again in the bushes. We stayed aware but didn't overreact like before. After about 6 minutes, something hit the truck. We flipped on out light bar and got out to see what it was. There was nothing around the truck that could've hit it except for a nearby stick. My friend threw the stick back in the woods and we all got back in the truck. It was about 5 minutes later in the same location when something hit the truck again. Like before we turned the light on and got out. We looked around for the object and it turned out to be the exact same stick. This is when things got weird because he threw the stick back in the woods and got back inside. Then it happened again and as we're outside, we threw the same stick back and we were still looking around as we continued to hear movement. Then as we were still outside, I saw the same stick fly out of nearby bushes and hit the hood of the truck. That's when we knew that we had to leave. This had all of us very upset and honestly frightened for our lives. At first I was open to the idea of a ""Bigfoot"" but after this night, I was convinced. I have since gone back up and have had other experiences but not as severe. Id be willing to show an expert.","North Fork Snoqualmie River Road north of North Bend, WA.",King County,Washington,Spring,47.6016,-121.6785,4/5/16,51753,Class B,44.96,39.24,33.52,0.94,Overcast until evening.
I was driving down South Kingston road January 25th on a Tuesday at about 1030pm. After coming around the last turn before the road turns to Miller Bay Road I saw something I will never forget. It looked as though a tall dark man was standing behind a tree. My headlights shined right at it and it seemed to try to pull its body behind the tree. It sent shivers up my back!

"I was driving to work this morning and came around a right hand corner and less than 100 ft in front of me was a large upright dark hairy object/animal/person in the roadway walking briskly from the left to the right. It was standing on two legs. I observed long arms swinging with the hands bent backwards like if you were swimming, as it walked quickly to the base of the bank next to the road. By the time I was parallel with where it crossed it was gone. It did not look at me. My husband and I drove back by it later this afternoon and didn't stop due to traffic at that time of day but noticed areas on both sides of the road where something has been using the spot to go across. I didn't see it out of the corner of my eye. I saw it dead on in front of me. My thoughts were whatever I saw didn't belong there. It was very dark and very tall and my headlights were right on it.","The location is very rural no homes.

"My best friend and I were returning from a hunting trip for turkey in eastern WA for my 50th Birthday. With no success further east we went to Teanaway. Again no success, as we returned to the freeway in Cle Elum I was saying to my friend we need to watch for elk and deer as I have seen some bad wrecks on I-90. We spotted one deer when the next thing my friend said ""what is that"". As I approached the area I spotted the movement along the highway and he looked at me and said ""bigfoot"". As we came closer this creature stepped onto the edge of the highway looking dead off into my friend's face as we passed, me braking, I looked into the review side mirror only to see it take two steps onto the highway. I turned to look back at the road ahead so as not to crash, I returned my gaze to my mirrors only to have it gone from the road. It was not a person or a bear, absolutely not. I have never feared going into the woods but will no longer do my 3:30am hunting trips for turkey by myself ever again, let alone camp alone.","West bound I-90 just west of Cle Elum on the shoulder crossing from north to south, should still be footprints there.",Kittitas County,Washington,Spring,47.1902,-120.9783,5/12/14,45049,Class A,65.97,55.29,44.61,0.43,Clear throughout the day.
"I was walking in the woods behind the resort. It was pretty quiet, all I could hear was the Cle Elum river down below. I looked through the trees and saw an auburn colored Sasquatch walking.

"Me and two other friends arrived at a campsite near Cooper Lake Washington we settled for a campsite that was a couple of miles away from the lake because we couldn't make it past the snow. As we pulled into the dirt road that brings you to the campsite there was a tree covering the road into the site so we moved the tree and proceeded down to the campsite. We found as we got there that the previous campers have left their gear and it seemed as though they were in a hurry but we didn't think much of it other than that they were rude and disrespectful for leaving garbage and stuff laying around. After we got camp set up and got a fire going it started to get dark and down about a hundred feet of elevation in a two hundred yards away we heard a noise that none of us had ever heard before sort of like a really rapid yodel or tongue trill. The girl I was with was immediately frightened and hid behind me and my other friend said guys don't get too freaked out it's either like a wolf or a coyote and we listened again as it covered that 200 yards distance in about two seconds. Became much louder and four or five times vocalized this yodel I almost couldn't answer it from fear, but I was able to let out a scream. After I screamed it became silent and then behind us something hit our truck, sounds kept happening around us and we started to try to see what it was. This noise was very loud and very close and quite obviously directed at us. After that we heard wood knocks through the night but no more Close Encounters as I stayed awake most of the night in fear with one hand on my knife and one hand on a flashlight.

"I was deer hunting near Ellensburg, specifically GMU 328 Naneum unit last October 2020. On the 5th day of my hunt I was looking over an open area that butted up to woods and I saw a shape at the tree line that was standing upright and appeared to be a person in a Ghille suit. I thought that was odd because it is required to wear hunter orange during this hunt. I then looked down to retrieve my binoculars that were resting on my chest and I raised them up to scan the area and the person or thing was gone. I scanned the area with my eyes and binoculars and did not see it again. The person or thing I saw was approximately 300 yards away from me and there weren’t very many hunters out on this day. I then moved on via foot to an area I haven’t hunted yet and after about a ten minute walk I saw a track on the ground that looked like a human bare foot mark in the dirt. I took a photo of it and looked around the area for more tracks but could not locate any. The area was mostly a logged area with short field type grass and just a little bit of dirt in the area. The size of the print was only about a size 11 size foot.

"The incident took place during the summer of 2017 in the Teanaway area of Kittitas County, just outside of Cle Elum WA. Our group was built of 4 persons staying the night in a free camping area. I do not remember the exact date only it was late August. The campground only had one trailer in the entire area, and it was a family with two small children. We were in two tents. I had drawn the short straw and was sleeping in the back of one of our vehicles. The campground is very remote (no cell service) one road in kind of situation. And runs along a river. It also coincides with free-range area for cattle. We spent the day playing games and hanging out at the river. The night was spent by the fire, typical camping trope. We all retired to our sleeping quarters. It was about 3 in the morning when I woke to rustling outside. I was in the back of the jeep had taken up, the windows were down, and the doors unlocked. It was pitch black outside and when I sat up and looked out. There hunched over the picnic table was a large black mass going through our stuff/trash. Yes I understand the variables at play in this situation. We had left our trash out, racoons or bears being the best bet. However the argument I have and what I know for a fact and what plays over in my head. This mass was almost leaning on the bench seating, and hunching over and cycling through our bags and trash. Not to mention later that morning once we had all got to go out and inspect the area. There was no mess, no trash scattered, or a scene that happens when animals do come into camp. When I saw it at first my natural instinct was (Bear) so I slowly rolled up the windows, and locked the doors. I watched this thing from about 15 feet away. An Absolute black mass in pitch dark forest, move from one side of the camp to the other. I didnt have a flashlight. Even if i used my phone, I was shaking with fear, for myself and my friends who were feet away in tents. I laid down and closed my eyes and just waited till light broke through the trees. When I sat up again with barely an hour of sleep, it was now 8 in the morning. And to my left was a massive Bull (Cow). It meandered around camp for a few minutes but didnt do anything. At first I chalked thats experience up to it being a cow. But the cow left distinct hoof marks and and the length of the cow was not what I saw. Not to mention this figure I witnessed was tall, I couldnt put a number on it. And it showed a certain dexterity only a ""biped"" sort of thing could. I wanna note that I have gone every which way to make this a bear. In my head I play it back and try to make it out as a bear and bear only, but it just does seem possible as such. Only till now do I see it as something else.",Free Range Cattle Area Free state campground,Kittitas County,Washington,Summer,47.21551,-120.9383,8/27/21,69553,Class B,67.42,55.835,44.25,0.69,Partly cloudy throughout the day.
"I was hiking about 2-3 mile from our camp in Wenatchee National Forest and was sitting on a bluff that give an excellent view of the surrounding ridges. After a while of sitting and seeing nothing I hear a series of heavy sounding thuds that sound like they were in the rhythm of a person walking. I had no idea what it was. I thought maybe it was a deer bouncing away buy it didn't quite sound right. The thuds were almost cartoonishly heavy and loud. Then about 5 minutes later I hear what sounds exactly like someone banging two rocks together. I was still deeply confused as to what the sound could be. It sounded like it was maybe 40 or 50 yards away just into the tree and brush, out of sight. I got up and grabbed my rifle and started down to where the sound was. When I was about 10 feet from the trees I had the sasquatch epiphany, so speak, realizing it might be sasquatch. Every hair on my body stood on end as I made my way immediately back to the top of the bluff. I was still hearing the rock banging so I grabbed two rocks and banged them 3 times back at it. There was a pause and then I heard three bangs back. I went back and fourth with this thing for about 10-15 minutes. It would mimmick the number of bangs I would do. I do 2 bangs it does 2 bangs. I do 4 bangs it does 4 bangs. I was far too freaked out at this point two investigate further especially because it was getting dark. I made my way back to camp and shared the story. There's only one way to access that area and nobody else had been up there. My friends suggested maybe a bear was snapping it's jaws but there was a nearby gut pile from a deer my brother had shot earlier that day that was untouched. If a bear was in the area I would think if would have investigated the guts. Later I had my dad stand about as far away from me as I thought the sounds were and had him bang two rocks. It sounded exactly the same. I'm not sure what it could have been other than a sasquatch. We were the only people camping up that road.","In the mountains west of Jungle creek trail.

"We set out to do some squatching at Interstate State Park in Wisconsin.  Our party consisted of 4 adults and 2 children.  We set up camp and had dinner in the South Campground.  After dark we began our first night op at 10pm.  We left my wife and the 2 year old in camp with the fire.  Nick, his pregnant wife Jennie, their 5 year old son Atticus, and I went up a small ridge above our campsite to begin.  We walked slowly working south east of camp and further from the campground.  After about 5 minutes we heard something in the woods following us intermittently we stopped and waited with lights off for about 4 minutes. We continued to walk and stop with lights off until we got about a half mile from the camp.  At this point Atticus, the 5 year old, was ready to go back.  We started back and then stopped to do some whoops.  I did two whoops spaced about 30 seconds apart, no returned noises.  We continued to walk and stop.  When we were halfway back we let Atticus try some whoops.  He did two about 30 seconds apart.  After his second whoop there was an immediate response from within a hundred yards of us.  It was a slightly higher pitch whoop than I have heard before.  We waited about 4 minutes before continuing to go back to camp.  When we were about 100 yards from camp we stopped.  Jennie and Nick remained with lights off as Atticus and I turned our flashlights on and returned to camp.  As they sat by a tree they both heard something approaching them from the direction of the returned whoop.  It got so close that Nick stood up.  Then it took “four large, quick, heavy steps” back.  When Nick turned his flashlight on nothing was seen.  They then returned to camp.  As we sat and debriefed in camp we heard noises around camp, but dismissed them as raccoons.  I was looking to the woods beyond camp and began to see orange eye shine.  I thought it was a single star, but it moved lightly and would leave and return into view.  The next morning I saw that where I was seeing the glow was well below the ridge line and could not have been a star. Nick and I traded places while sitting in camp and he saw the same shine leave and return a few times as well.  Nick and I returned to near where he and Jennie had sat to leave an apple in a tree.  We all went to bed around 12:30 am.  Nick, Atticus, and I slept in a tent while Jennie, Sara and Hagen slept in a small teardrop camper.  After falling asleep Nick and I both woke up abruptly at 1:35am.  We immediately looked outside the tent to see a raccoon on the picnic table.  When we made noises to scare it away we heard something else moving around camp. We listened for a while before returning to sleep.  At 3:10 am we were woke up again.  We listened for a while, heard nothing, and went back to bed.  In the morning Jennie told us what happened to them in the camper.  At 1:35 am she was woke up not by the raccoon on the picnic table, but by something large walking in the woods behind camp.  She heard us scare away the raccoon and whatever was in the woods walked off.  At 3:10 am something started to shake the camper.  She said the camper was moved back and forth 3 times.  Her reaction was to laugh out loud from inside the camper.  She laughed because Sara and Hagen were sleeping through the event.

I was on my way to the vet and on highway 47 as I came over a hill and Crested the top of the hill I saw a Bigfoot standing on the shoulder it was the only thing in my entire viewing area besides woods on each side it was dark brown in appearance it had two legs and one arm as I saw a profile view it jumped off into the ditch line and went into the woods. I immediately thought of what I just saw & my conclusion was a bigfoot. It was vertical & on a slight angle as it was ready to go into the woods. It was heading g north. I could see the width of legs & its body shape only but I was at too far a distance to make out hair or face. There  was nothing to abstruct my view because what was in back of him was shoulder and the road that continued West which also went up to a hill I only saw it because I crested over the hill it was plain as day what it was until he disappeared into the woods. I immediately called my husband and he got to the site I described approximately 45 minutes later. He reported seeing something had jumped and made a clearing into a small snow bank and also reported seeing some sort of tracks going along a deer trail which led to a deer carcass.

Hello This is something that had happened twice in 2 years .But in the same month of August. I believe in August of 2010 at night I had smelled something very very bad like body odor at night. It was an august summer night my dogs (2 labs) just looked at the window and didn't even bark or move. But I remember earlier that night the dogs wouldn't even go outside.So it was about 2 in the morning and I got up and closed my windows because of the smell. That was the only time I had smelled anything like that ever. Then last summer 2011 in august again I was out hanging clothes to dry (I work 2nd shift) on the line. I could hear the coyotes barking from the other side of the lake which I live on and the coyotes barking out behind a horse pasture behind my place . My dogs were over by the lake.Then all of a sudden they came running to the driveway facing the pasture . They wouldn't go past the light of the house.And the weird thing was all the noises I was hearing like the coyotes and the night noises stopped. The dogs kept looking up the driveway and at the little bit of swamp next to the house.So after I got my clothes hung up I got into the house as fast as I could. One thing that made me think about what had happened was from watching your show. And even know I haven't seen one I do believe . I have also seen a wolf up here that was as large as the front of my car 4 feet tall at the back .It was the biggest wolf I have ever seen.,Were I live I am about 4 miles from an Indian reservation (The Menominee res.) I live on a lake that has a small river system that runs in and out of the lake .There are alot of forest around and swamp.

"I was leaving my cabin heading back from the Pembine area to Green Bay as I rounded a corner and headed south on county road OO.  I saw a figure cross the road.  It walked slowly from East to West as though not in any hurry.  I viewed it from the area just above the elbow up.  It had a pointed head, very broad shoulders, and large biceps.  I could see the arms swing as it walked just as a human would do.  Its color was brown... a mix of dark and light brown with the sun shining off it.  It was not black.  I sped up to get a good look at it and it was gone. I stopped where I saw it cross and looked to the east.  The area was open with scrub brush and it's color would have blended in perfect with the surrounding area.   It was early spring and there were no leaves on the tree.  I could only see to the hills and it would have to have gone 100 to 150 yards down then up to not be seen.

"I'm part of a paranormal group,we were out last night, I heard 3 knocks, didn't think nothing of it at the time, thought people in the woods playing around, but my partner went to take pics in the woods, sat on a park bench, and said he heard some snorts, we thought just a deer or something. Then we sat to do an EVP session, before we started the recorders we heard something kill a deer, then it sounded so close we decided to maybe get out of there, we started to leave and got some eye shine, thought maybe coyotes, but looked at the pics, the eye shine is well over the 3 ft peas growing in the farm field, what's weird is I went out today, and there's nothing in the field disturbed, no blood, no body, no trace of anything??

"It was around 4:30 p.m. we were heading back to Lake Tomahawk from Woodruff.  It was sunny but sun was low in the sky,  Forest on each side of the highway, leaves were down with thick undergrowth and thick with pine trees. We saw an all black figure run across the road. It was about 7-8 feet tall and lanky. It took about 5 strides to cross from forest to forest. It ran straight up-- stride effortlessly without stumbling or looking side to side just looked straight ahead. It ran across the road in 3-4 seconds. the sides of the road were at a 40 degree angle to the road bed. It was about 3 football fields in front of us. There was a small red car about 200ft in front of us but it showed no reaction. It did not slow down. We pinpointed where it went in and out the woods and there was no trails or road.

"On Sunday, July 07, 2019, my brother, sister and I took an excursion through Northern Wisconsin.  We were traveling north on South Turcott Road, approximately 6.5 miles north of Tripoli, WI.  Turcott is a rough, gravel road and we were traveling approximately 10-15 mph in a Chevy Suburban.  My brother was driving, I was in the front passenger seat, and our sister was in the right rear passenger seat. The day was clear and cool.  Our windows were rolled up because the deer flies were very thick.  As we drove through the forest, we came to a clearing to our right, on the east side of the road.  The clearing had a lot of brush and fallen logs as it had been logged off.  Across the clearing to our east, approximately 100-150 yards away, the forest began again. I was looking out across the clearing when I saw a large, reddish-brown, upright figure running along the edge of the trees in the distance.  It seemed to be hunched over as it ran.  It was too large to be a deer, and did not have a proper height, or gait, for a bear.  I only saw it for a moment before my view was obstructed by brush.  I wasn’t sure what I saw so I turned to my brother and said, “I think I just saw…”  At that moment, he abruptly stopped the vehicle and pointed out my window and yelled, “THERE!!!”  My sister and I both looked, but it was gone. I asked my brother what he saw and he said it was a big, hairy, reddish-brown figure with no neck, nor muzzle - thick, and too tall to be a deer.  He said it was standing upright on the edge of the woods.  He estimated it to be about six feet in height and he said he saw it look over its shoulder before it ran into the woods.  He also said the smaller trees moved aside like it was pushing its way into the woods. After he told me what he saw, I told him that what I saw was exactly the same color and I’d have described it exactly the same way: Big, hairy, reddish-brown, and hunched over.","From Route 8 in Tripoli to sighting location is 6.2 miles.

"I was on my way from my house in Stevens Point, Wisconsin to Hayward, WI for a fishing tournament on the Chippewa Flowage. My team partner and I left Stevens point at 3 AM in the morning on Friday, July 12 to practice for the tournament on the following Saturday. The route that I take goes through Phillips, WI. However, I have a shortcut that takes me around the town of Phillips. Specifically, I turn west onto Dama Rd. off of HWY 13. I then take Dama to Mink Ranch Rd. and turn right heading north. I then take another right onto E Wilson Flowage Rd. It is at this point when we saw what we believe may have been a Sasquatch. It was roughly 5:15 AM when I turned onto E Wilson Flowage Rd. When we turned about 70 yards in front of us in the middle of the road was a big black animal that had its rear end facing us. At that point it we startled it and it took a quick look at us and ran into the woods. That's when we both thought we had just seen a gorilla. It was easily six ft tall and when it ran into the woods we could tell that the creature had a 45 degree angled back from head to rear end. Not at all like a bear. Additionally, it ran into the woods using its front two arms like an ape. Using its knuckles like an ape. We continued on with our trip questioning what we saw. I just happened to google Sasquatch in Wisconsin and saw that Phillips is a hot bed for activity.

"On June 30th, 2018, at approximately 9:45pm, I was headed south on Highway 13, approximately two miles south of Park Falls in Price County, Wisconsin. It was dark, with my headlights the only light source. In summary, while driving at approximately 50mph, an animal on all fours ran in front of my vehicle (2015 Ford Taurus SHO) - left to right/east to west.  I nearly hit the animal as it came within five feet of the front of my vehicle. My observation was only a split second, but it left a very big impression, mainly because it didn’t make sense (as explained in the last paragraph). My wife was in the passenger seat, but was on her phone texting, and she only looked up because I swerved to avoid the animal. She never observed it. Hairy and brown, I did not see the head, mainly because it was slumped down on fours, and the fast speed it was moving. My dimensions are approximate from my viewpoint as the driver 46” high (legs), 46” (long) torso = 92” or 7’6” if standing. (I took a tape measure, and immediately took approximate measurements after arriving to my destination five or six miles away). I’ve been vacationing in this area since 1975 as a child. It was not a black beer (brown beer are not indigenous to this area), it wasn’t a deer, wolf or coyote. With this in mind, I’m left with a lot of unanswered questions, and quite possibly someone else saw this animal too.",See above,Price County,Wisconsin,Summer,45.90015,-90.43416,6/30/18,59659,Class B,89.27,77.77,66.27,0.58,Heavy rain starting in the evening.
I was traveling down Highway NN when I glanced over and saw something upright.  It was NOT a bear. I know what a black bear looks like and this was huge and on two feet. I slammed on the brakes and backed up to the location (to view down the road where I saw it). I stayed there for a few minutes to see if I could hear or see anything.

"The Wisconsin River runs right by my town.  I am an avid deer hunter, turkey hunter, fisherman and so on.  I have been in the woods my whole life (48 years old) in this area and I had never seen this before.  I was leaving to go deer hunting and I had just pulled onto the main highway along the river and started to accelerate when I looked down into the river bottoms where there are a lot of tops and trees and general river wash and sitting on a log was a what looked like a very large hairy man all dressed in a shaggy brown fur.  It was just coming daylight and I was doing about 20 miles an hour when I went by but its head was down in between its shoulder blades like and I remember that the legs just looked huge and the top of the head was cone shaped.  I got down to the intersection and turned around and went back but when I got back whatever was there was already gone.  There is a natural high bank bend in the river about 30 yards from where it was sitting so whatever it was could have moved under that and out of sight.  I have heard sounds that are on tape since I was a young boy coon hunting with my dad in these bottoms and my dad always said that something followed us while we were coon hunting the river bottoms but since it didn't bother us he never bothered it and that him and my uncle would often skin the coon right in the woods and leave the carcass for whatever was there.  They called the one valley north of us ""The Screaming Woman Valley"" because late at night in the late fall, early winter people used to hear screams from the bottoms that were often just put off as a bobcat or lynx. In 2012 I was not sure what I saw but as time goes on and I talk to people I am convinced that I saw a Sasquatch that morning.

"My experience happened in early fall of 2011. It was warm that year and this happened right before Halloween. I was out walking at Douglas County Park with my boyfriend, his friend and my youngest son who was 3 at the time. We walked back past the corn field and worked our way to the bridge that crossed a creek just before you hit the heavy wooded area. I was tossing leaves in the creek on one side of the bridge and Ethan would run to the other side to look for it floating down stream. I heard a series of loud knocks from the woods, I looked at my friends and they heard it too.  It was suggested that it was probably just other people out walking. So I shrugged it off. We started back towards our car because it was starting to get dark and I heard a loud scream. It was nothing I had heard before, too clear to be human.. and too loud for coyote. It did give me the creeps, my friends acted as if it was nothing and we kept walking. A few minutes later I heard a loud scream again only this time it was closer. At that point I picked up my son looked behind me and all I could see was tall grass. Nothing there, my friends made a joke about it being a bigfoot and we worked our way back to the car. I have never heard a yell like that before and could not point it to any animal that I know of.  For the record it sounded nothing like the screams on “Finding Bigfoot” It was loud, higher pitched almost like a female scream but there was no strain to it. I believe what I heard was a Sasquatch.","Donald county park has Deer Creek running through it and there is a large area of water shed land.

"On Tuesday November 26th, 2013 I was driving south on Hwy 151 from Madison, WI going back to Iowa after seeing a concert at the Red Zone which ended around 11:30 PM.  My wife was laying down and trying to get some sleep in the back seat of the car since she had to work the next morning.  I normally work night shift so I had no problem staying awake to drive home. The oncoming traffic on the highway was spaced about one car every 3/4 of a mile to a mile with some farther apart so I couldn't use my high beams.  I'm a former Iowa police officer so I have a habit of periodically looking at the mile markers along the road so that if I have to call for help I can give a better idea of where we're at. I would say about a half mile or so after coming around the large curve southwest of Mineral Point, which I believe would be about mile marker 36, I was in the outside lane and I passed a large black figure standing upright on two legs where the grass meets the gravel on the inside shoulder of the median on my left. The headlights never hit it directly as I approached but the outside area of the light field lit it up as I passed it.  I'm 6'02"" and I was able to see the body from the ground up to the shoulder.  I would estimate the shoulder height to be around 6'06"" to 6'08"".  With the angle of the light beam and how low the car sits to the ground it looked like the head was shadowed by the shoulder so I wasn't able to see its face. The distance between us was about fifteen feet when I passed by.  I was able to see it's hand hanging down along the thigh and it was a lighter color and not midnight black like the color of it's body.  The thickness of it's body looking from the side, it's back to it's chest, was about two feet thick.  The fur or hair was hard to see do to the distance, the light conditions, and the speed of the car (cruise was set at 65mph) but it was short. I thought to myself, ""What was that?"" even though I know what it was and ""I didn't just see that."" My immediate physical reaction was extreme anxiety.  My chest tightened and I made excuses to myself to not stop and look at it.  From what I saw I had no desire to stop. A couple miles passed while I tried to overcome the fear then I realized I need more facts on the conditions of the sighting.  I also felt that it was trying to cross the highway from the south that's why I didn't see it up ahead of me in the headlights.

I grabbed a stick and started to hit the tree to see if I can get the squirrel to move out of the tree. I sat there for a few minutes and walked off. I walked away from the tree and heard some knocks off in the distances. I thought it was some thing else so I kept on going. I walked for a few more minutes and I looked back.

"I had identified through the VA game finder website that Rockingham county (VA) was a good area for turkey hunting.  The spot I chose allowed us to park at a campsite (WV) and hike into the woods around 7-8 miles to the hunting spot (VA).  Let me start by saying that I was never into and never followed Bigfoot.  I know the story of course but never payed any real attention to it until I came home from the trip. We arrived at the campground late.  There was only 1 other camper there with a RV.  We started into the woods around 5pm.  The terrain is extremely rugged and steep.  As we were hiking we noticed that it was very quiet.  Not a single bird call, or anything.  It was an eerie feeling.  We set up camp about 3 miles on the path that led up to the observation tower (High Knob).  We had dinner and got into the tent around 9-10 pm.  Around 11-12 pm my brother and I heard a very odd howl, it lasted for around 10 seconds.  It was not a dog or bear or anything I had heard before.  I thought it was strange but assured my brother it was nothing.  Around 2 pm my friend woke me up and pointed at his ear, signaling me to listen.  I paused and listened.  To me I heard what sounded like someone  slowly walking up to our tent, choosing their steps very carefully.  I whispered to him its a deer to calm his nerves.  But all three of us listened as the steps got closer.  The steps were heavy but slow.  My brother said to me ""Get the shotgun.""  But not in a whisper.  The steps stopped and sounded like they went the other direction.  I got out of the tent and saw nothing, it was too dark.  The next morning we continued up the hill.  At the top of hill .5 mile from where we camped there was a large pile of feces with acorns in it.  Possibly bear, not sure.  My brother was in poor psychical condition and could not continue so we decided to leave. When I got home I decided to see if i could find an animal call matching the sound we had heard.  I looked up a lot of different animals, from cougars to foxes.  Nothing matched.  Until I found a bigfoot website with sound recordings.  The first one I clicked was it.  I called my brother on the phone and said recognize this?  Played the recording and he said ""Hell yeah, that's what we heard in the woods."" I've done a lot of research on Bigfoot since that trip and I'll be going back there this November, I'll try and do a few calls or knocks and see what happens.","Go west on 33 from VA to the WV side, first campground on the left before Brandywine.",Pendleton County,West Virginia,Winter,38.57502,-79.18524,11/1/10,30154,Class B,48.42,35.52,22.62,0.83,Clear throughout the day.
"On August 30 2012 between 9:07-9:45pm. I was traveling to my father's home in the Moyers area of Pendleton county, WV. I decided to stop along side of a small road, county rt 25 Moyers Gap rd. I stopped half way up Hoover mountian when I heard an unusual howl sounding like three woops (I'm pretty certain it was three). Being familiar with both wild animal sounds and those of farm animals I was startled because I immediately thought of sounds I've heard Bobo make on the show. I cupped my hands around my mouth and attempted to recreate the sound i just heard. I gave three loud woop sounds in medium tempo. After about 5-10 seconds I heard two woop sounds coming from the same direction as the first down over the mountain to my left. Again I cupped my hands and let out two loud woop sounds in about the same tempo as i had just heard. This time I heard a sharp crack of wood and a different type of howl, it sounded angry or frustrated maybe? to me. Unfortunately, a white gmc pick up truck began coming down the mountain. The loud crack and howl were the last sounds I heard that night. I waited for about 45 minutes in the truck I was driving, several times I attempted to get responses by making woop sounds none of my calls were returned again. I was so excited by this encounter.

"On November 19th 2012 the first day of hunting season in West Virginia, I experienced a few events that I am unable to explain. My step father and I were hunting in Pendleton County and had split up on either side of a ridge. At around 6 am before daylight, I heard a loud ""whooping"" that was so loud it almost sounded as if it came from an amplifier. This only happened once, but my step father and I both heard it and agreed it wasn't a normal animal sound. After lunch we went back into the woods. We split up again, this time I was going to try to hunt a thicker area than I did in the morning. The treestand I was going to had large boulders behind it with some very thick vegetation. I began climbing the treestand when all of a sudden in behind me in the boulders going up the ridge I heard what sounded like a very angry growl and what sounded like two rocks being smashed together violently. I jumped halfway out of the tree off the ladder, and as I turned around to see what had growled at me (which I thought was a bear) I saw a large black/dark brown head and shoulders quickly duck behind a boulder. This was the most frightened I have ever been in the woods. I backpedalled as quickly as I could in the other direction, never losing sight of the boulder. When I was about 100 yards away, the thing peeked out again and quickly shot back behind the boulder when it saw I was watching. Needless to say I got out of there.

"My father and I are both proud Mountain State natives, although we no longer reside in WV. But we do enjoy returning every spring for trout fishing and sometimes smallmouth bass fishing. My father and I have been fishing the West Fork of the Greenbrier for trout for years and also enjoy camping there. We set camp up about a 1/4 mile from a little tiny place called Wildell. Its way out in the middle of no where. Our plans were to fish and camp April 26th, 27th, 28th. The first night was quiet and we just got some sleep. The next night around the fire we just decided to try fishing on the West Fork again instead of going to another stream. We were really tired so we ate a quick dinner and went to bed. My father snores really loud so I sleep in a separate tent. I was sleeping but kept hearing noises in the background, which is normal in the woods. But I kept hearing this screaming sound waaaay off on the side of the mountain across the road (which was in front of the camp). I didnt bother me much and I just kept trying to sleep but it kept getting closer, louder, and was just constantly screaming. It got so loud and close that at one point I litterly woke up, sat up quickly in my tent and said out loud ""what the #*%# is that!?"" At that moment the sounds stopped. I dont know if it heard me say that, hear me shuffling around in the tent but for whatever reason it stopped instantly. I told my dad about it the next morning and he said he didnt hear anything. People say that bobcats and mountain lions make sounds by ""screaming"" and it could have been. I really dont know as it was pitch black outside. All I can say is that it sounded like a woman screaming as hard as she could at the top of her lungs for as long as she could and it was it was such a solid level of noise I could feel it......if that even makes sense. I've never heard anything like that. That night after a long hard day of hard fishing with little luck, we ate dinner late because we fished a different stream an we didnt get back to camp until late. We cooked hamburgers in an iron skillet over the fire. The burgers were cooked in the left over bacon grease from breakfast and it smelled and tasted delicious. We were eating our burgers about 11:00 pm when my day said ""did you hear that?"" and I replied ""I didnt hear anything."" As soon as I said that we both heard what sounded like someone yelling at the top of their lungs down by the river in a long ""hooooooOHHHHH"" yell. The river was about 500 yards away but you could hear it like they were just on the other side of the woods by our camp. It echoed a loooong ways thru the way.  I really dont know how to describe it. It was a really loud and level at first then the yell went up to an even higher pitch and it lasted about 5 or 6 seconds. At that point my dad turned to me and said ""What in the H@LL was that!?"" and I replied ""I dont know!"" We sat silently listening for another call but heard nothing. Then we thought it might have someone in trouble but we thought they would have been yelling for help or calling out someones name. Well. after a long restless night of little sleep nothing else happened. My dad and I talked about it the whole next morning. We have both never heard anything like that. It was a really loud, clear, powerful ""yell."" So after we got home my dad was telling my mom about it and she laughed and said maybe it was bigfoot. My dad and I looked at each other with surprise on our faces. So to spare you the details, I got on the internet and did some research and found this site. Not only did I find this site, but I found another report from hunters at Wildell who said they saw tracks and one hunter saw 2 ""creatures."" At this point my dad and I were a little freaked out. Then I came across the recording section on this website and listened to the recording from Snohomish County, WA and not only did my dad freak out but the hair on both my arms stood straight up and I was covered in goose bumps. That recording is EXACTLY what we heard. I have been a sportsman my whole life, even growing up fishing the mountains in WV, and I never miss a hunting season. I have heard and seen alot of things and I have NEVER heard anything like that in my life, nor has my dad. I havent told many people about this but the ones I have told it too have laughed and thought we were crazy. I dont care what they say or think, I know what I heard 2 nights in row and it really happened and I cant take it back.",26th across the road parrelling the West Fork of the Greenbrier River.

"In June I was backpacking the Allegheny Trail going south bound. I had hiked up the trail following the yellow blazes. As I got to the top and started the trek along the ridge line I noticed some of the blazes getting harder to find with what looked like attempts to scratch them off. I say this because I would find the paint chips and bark at the base of the trees. It was raining on and off with a strong wind blowing West/Northwest. The trail had quit a few blow-downs and up-roots but I also would come across smaller trees broken off or up-root laying across the trail opposite the wind direction. I was hiking toward a shelter along the trail using my map book and came upon it late in the afternoon. The following morning I was awoken by a loud noise nearby. At first I could not identity the sound but then I realized it was to Flat Creek, stones being ""clacked"" together. The sound would at first be close by and then a few seconds later would be repeated farther away until it was almost out of ear shot and then it would return getting louder and louder passing by and diminishing in the other direction. It was in a north to south direction back and forth several times and then it stopped. Soon after that I felt and heard movement on the outside of the shelter and something stepped heavily on an old plastic tarp that was left spread out along the side of the shelter at that point I yelled "" get out of here"" and I did not hear any thing more. It was very unnerving.","The ""Wildell Shelter"" along the Allegheny Trail on Shavers Mountain.

"My wife and I were taking an evening drive on Highland Scenic Highway 150, from US 219 near Slatyfork, WV, to the Cranberry Glades area on Tuesday evening 9/6/16.  We had been stopping at the scenic overlooks taking pictures, and had just left the Williams River overlook, and headed south on 150.  There was a stretch of highway that was very straight and a downslope of about 4-6% about 1-2 miles south of the Williams River overlook.  As we were driving down, we both noticed something in the weeds between the road edge and the bank leading up to the woods on the west side.  At first I thought it was a deer, with its head and neck stretched up above the weeds.  It was about 300-400 feet ahead, and while we continued towards it, it spun around, similar to an about face, but with the head dropping and a semi-crouch as it was turning.  It jumped up onto the bank, reaching for a branch to aid in pulling itself up.  By the time it jumped, we were within 80-100 feet of it.  By the time we got to where it had been standing, it was nowhere in sight, and we could hear no sounds of running or branches breaking in the piney woods along the road.  We both noticed that the weeds at this point and all along the area, were even with the hood on the 3/4 ton Chevy pickup we were in, making the estimate on the height of the creature at about 7-7 1/2 ft tall.  The creature was a mix of brown, and brown gold fur, longer than deer hair, but not as long as collie fur.  I have never discounted that Sasquatch could be real, but this firsthand experience has removed my doubt.  As we left the area, my arms and neck were covered in goose-flesh, and we were both speechless for about 10 minutes.","38°11'21.6""N 80°15'07.9""W",Pocahontas County,West Virginia,Fall,38.18933,-80.2522,9/6/16,55554,Class B,78.77,68.82,58.87,0.18,Partly cloudy throughout the day.

"Last summer either end of June or early July I was trout fishing the shavers fork of the cheat river in Randolph county, West Virginia. I was wading on one side of a fork in the river with an island type feature in the middle of the two streams and heard the snap of twigs. I looked to the island and briefly saw a figure that was roughly 60 yds away, very tall and dark brown or black in color. At first I thought it was a person but there was no facial features I could make out at that distance it was all dark I assumed covered in hair. My next thought is that it was a bear, but it walked away out of view moments after I had eyes on it, on two feet, and carried a staff with it. The staff was large, probably st least 5-6” in diameter, larger than I believe a human could or would wish to use as a walking stick. The figure moved to my right, downstream and quickly out of view. I was frozen with fear and unarmed at the time so there was no way I was going to pursue it. I’ve only told a handful of people about it and most think it wasn’t true expect my wife who knows when I am being sincere. Earlier this month I visited my father who I now know is a Bigfoot enthusiast and told him about the sighting. He had urged me to report on this website so now I’m getting around to actually doing it.","It is a road off harpertown road from Elkins, WV.

"About a week ago my dog was making a strange noise like he was playing around 12 at night. I called my friend who lives on the property to meet me outside. We went up the hill to my dog pen and he was acting as if he was playing, all happy running around and looking behind him. We shined our lights up the hill and saw a rather large figure about seven to eight feet tall and rather thick, step back into the darkness and disappear. It scared us and we ran. We have been hearing sounds every night. Last night we went out around 1:00 AM to do knocks and yells. Something growled back, not like a bear, and was very close and kept following us. My dog is still doing the same thing every night and my cats refuse to stay out at night. Before this started they wouldn't come in. We are on the side of a mountain with about two thousand hunting lease acres behind us. Neighbors about a third a mile away. We are on a dead end road with lots of animals and very secluded.

"My brother-in-law and I decided to go hunting on the last weekend of hunting season. We went to our camping spot that we have gone to for over 20 years and set up camp. This was on Friday night. The next day was uneventful and we were both tired so we went to sleep about 8 PM. Sometime later in the evening, I awoke to very loud screaming and some sort of yelling that I have never heard before in all my years of being in the wilderness. The screaming lasted about 20 to 30 seconds, stopped for about 20 seconds, then started again. This happened 3 times. I finally got my brother-in-law to wake up and he heard about 4 or 5 seconds of the third time. We were both very tired and he fell back asleep in seconds. It was really quiet. You could not hear anything. I could not go back to sleep after that. I laid in my sleeping bag inside the tent for about 30 to 40 minutes with dead silence in the forest. When I was just starting to doze off again, I heard footsteps entering our camp. I heard the footsteps, which were not of a 4 legged animal, walk past my side of the tent. It walked around the entire tent and I saw a shadow on the end of the tent about 5 feet high. With the moon being up in the sky, whatever cast the shadow had to have been taller than 5 feet. It circled the tent and walked by my side again. It stopped at the other end of the tent and scratched the material like it was trying to figure out what the material was. It walked away from the tent after that and went across the gravel road. I could hear the gravel under its feet. After it crossed the road, it went into the woods. After a minute or so, I heard the sound of 2 sticks hitting together about 15 to 20 times. Nothing else happened for the rest of the night. The next morning, we got up and I told my brother-in-law what else had happened during the night. We looked for tracks around the tent, but the ground was covered with a thick layer of leaves and pine needles. We looked on the road , but the road bed is red clay based and very hard. We packed our gear and headed for home.

"Since October I have had many howls, wood knocks, eyeshine instances. I believe they have always frequented the hardwoods across the street, but since the recent logging of thousands of acres of pine in the area they have taken up full time residency across the street. There is a large swamp that butts up to the hardwoods. The night of January 21st, 2017 was the most incidental of all so far. After making some calls on my front porch I got a wood knock from the woods across the street. My dog ran toward the activity and barked for a long time. When I heard his collar stop jingling and the barking stopped I got worried and went into the woods with a large limb. I beat against a large oak and yelled ""I want my Dog!"". I heard a woodknock close by then a chest beat and a bluff charge through the brush. Then a tree push down. I yell roared ""I want my Dog!"" and beat hard against the tree.

"I am 45 years old, have spent my whole life in the woods. I have been hunting and fishing since I was very young. On June 28th my wife and I decieded to take a walk in the woods. We were heading to a secluded resivior located aprox. 2 miles in the woods. We came upon a spot in the woods that seemed liked someone was watching us. We heard a noise come from some bushes. I thought it was a grunt from a buck. We both expected to a deer come outof the brush. I said, maybe it was a Bigfoot. She told me to shut up and keep walking. We walked for another 15 minutes and realized we were on the wrong path to the lake. We stopped, ate lunch and headed back into the woods. We had stopped at some power lines and sat in some shade. It was over 94 gegrees that day, and this was about noon time. As we walked back, we both noticed some very DEEP foot prints that did not look right. They were clearly 5 toed ""Human"" prints. In between the prints, was some deer tracks. The tracks clearly looked like the Human prints were chasing the deer prints. We both looked at each other and said, why would someone be running Barefoot, in 100 degree weather in the middle of the woods on a Tuesady afternoon? There were no other people in the woods at that time. The tracks were not there the first time we passed this spot, the noise was, the tracks were not. At this point I became very concerned that what ever made the prints was still in the area. I grabbed a big rock and told my wife to take some pictures with her cell phone. The tracks were about 6 to 7 feet apart. I could tell the first print was a right foot, that jumped out of the woods. The sixth and final step was a left foot that looked like it pushed off into the woods. No other tracks were before or after these six prints. We both became very nervous and started talking loudly and whistling. I did not want to run into this ""person"". We became a little confused and ended up on the worng path home. We walked for a couple hours, no way were we going back the way we came. Did not notice any smells or sounds. Just very quiet.

"Approx. summer of 2000, I was on Negus Mountain in Rowe, MA (Franklin County) with my wife, sitting on the tailgate...we heard something in the woods, about 100 yards away, walking towards us.  As it got closer, it started to walk faster.  As a life long hunter, I at first told her not to worry, it's a squirrel or something.  As this creature got closer, my ears and experience told me that this was a biped, only 2 feet crunching through the leaves.  My wife was so freaked out that we had to leave immediately before I could investigate more. Fast Forward to 2006, I was driving to work one night for the 2300 job in East Deerfield, MA.

In West Charlemont, at the end of so-called Tea Street Extension, there is a bridge that carries the road over the railroad tracks. This is about 2-3 miles (the way the bird flies) from the encounter above.  What I saw was something standing perfectly still behind the guardrail.

I drive this route almost daily (or nightly, in my case) for over 12 years, I know what belongs and what doesn't.  This did not belong.  I turned around and went back, and it was gone.  Being late for work, I turned around again and went to work.  I have never had any doubt that I saw a Sasquatch.  I haven't reported it because I don't want people to think I am a crackpot.

I was only half awake when I heard a real loud noise but not awake enough to really tell what it was except that it was a good ways off, I knew I was recording audio so I noted the time so I could find it on my recorder and went back to sleep, or at least I tried too. When I got home I found the sound on my MP3 recorder and it sounds a lot like a wood knock but judging by the amount of echo and how loud it was from so far away It had to be something real big that made that noise.

The ""clapping"" was non-rhythmic, sometimes there was one or two, other times there were many ""claps"".  In between the ""claps"" there was sounds of something walking, breaking fallen branches as it moved.  The sounds were about a distance of 100 feet from our position on the trail, within a thicker patch of woods.  We listened for almost a full minute and then decided to continue on the trail, moving closer to the source of the sound.  When we reached the area where we believed the clapping sound to be coming from we listened again and heard nothing and had seen no movement.

I knew that it came from a long distance away. I remember listening to Bigfoot calls years back and on a hunch ran inside found the EXACT same howls on the net sounded like the Snohomish, WA 1978-79 calls. I woke up my friend who has been hunting western mass for 30 years and he said he never heard anything like it. He heard it and he said it gave him the chills. The howls trailed off as if he creature was moving. Incident lasted for about 10 minutes. I google mapped the area the sound came from and its a huge swath of wilderness that stretches into Vermont and south into Connecticut.",Calls came from south west of Westwood Dr.,Hampden County,Massachusetts,Winter,42.08179,-72.82665,8/14/11,28667,Class B,68.66,66.785,64.91,0.53,Rain starting in the afternoon.
"Hiking the Seven Sisters Trail from Mt Holyoke to the Notch in the Hadley / Amherst area of Massachusetts. My hiking partner and I got to Taylor's Notch and could hear the wind ripping through making eerie noises. We both heard a lot of whistling  and breaking branches which I initially attributed to the wind going through the rocky ledges of Taylor's Notch. We hiked over one large hill and the wind was lessening but we realized the whistling was closer and then there were whooping noises and calls along with the whistles. The calls were going back and forth and I realized we were surrounded. We kept talking loudly hoping to scare off any animals and kept my bear spray in hand for the next mile or so. Not sure what it was but highly unusual and did not sound like a grown or baby bear,canine, coyote, mountain lion, or fox. I frequently hike and spend time outdoors. I am at a loss as to what was with us that day.

"I was driving near the town dump about 1:00 in the afternoon around the end of June last year, it was raining very hard, a large figure came out of nowhere, I hit my brakes but was far enough back that I would not have hit it, there was a car coming at me the other way, it almost ran into the back end of that car, it turned a little sideways to avoid the car, that's when I knew it was not a person or a bear, when it turned it flung its arm up and back a little to miss the car, it was a little hunched over, its shoulders were extremely wide, I couldn't make out any facial features, it was covered in dark brown hair and appeared to have hardly any neck, it was about 6"" taller than the mini van it almost ran into, if it was standing straight up I would guess it was about 6 to 6 and a half feet tall. The whole thing only took about 2 or 3 seconds but it really shook me up. I have always hiked in the woods around here and done a lot of tracking animals of all kinds, I have never seen anything that would resemble a bigfoot track, I have always had doubts about people seeing these, but now I will never doubt it again.

On April 2015 I was clicking on some YouTube videos when I came across one from my own town. It was a small town radio interview with a mother and daughter that were coon hunting at night in an area that I know well and they had a class A encounter. I told my son about it and he took a walk in the area a couple of days later. He called me and told me that he came across a structure that must have been built by boy scouts or something. I went in to check it a couple of days later and took some very good photos of it and some of the surrounding area.

"My 15 year old son, my friend and I were out frog gigging in a creek off of rd 179 near Sedona and I-17 in Az. This took place on 06-29-2014 at 1240 am. We entered the creek which is knownas beaver creek. We all had our gigs and 100 lumen lights. And were walking up stream after we entered the canyon in which the creek was located. As we entered the canyon I noticed a wrong musky, stinky smell, but I did not say anything because this could have been skunk or javelin which is common in the area. After walking for about 200 yards, my son who was in front stopped and said he heard something walking away from him up the creek. I asked if it was a deer or elk. He told me he could not see because of the under brush, but said it sound like a heavy person. We continued for a few more feet and we all then observed three large rocks thrown from the thick brush above are heads, about 20 yards in front of us over the creek to the opposite side. We all stopped and then heard branches crashing as something crossed the creek in front of us. We looked in all direction with our lights but the brush and trees were too thick to see. I stopped and hit my gig against a tree three times. We then heard branches breaking up stream. We then crossed the creek and stopped. A rock was then thrown toward us and landed in the creek 5 yards in front of us. I advised my son and my friend we need to go, but as we turned to go back out, something very large ran toward us from up the creek bottom in the thick bushes, breaking large branches. We searched with our lites but could not see anything. We then walked out and made it back to the truck.","Take I-17 south toward Flagstaff. Turn onto exit 179, travel 3 miles to Beaver creek.

"Our family was driving home from vacation last August when I saw something unusual in a cornfield. We were roughly 40-45 minutes north of Bethany Beach, Delaware traveling on Route 1 passing through farm country at the time.  We had rented a minivan and my husband was seated upfront driving with his Father next to him in the passenger's seat. They were busy talking.  My daughter and mother-in-law were seated in the row of seats behind them.  My mother-in-law was reading a book to my daughter at the time.  I was seated in the very last row of seats in the minivan and sat on the passenger's side of the car. As we were driving along and everyone else was busy either talking or reading, I was looking out the window at the passing countryside.  We were going through farm country at the time and as we drove past one corn field, something caught my eye.  The thing that initially got my attention was the fact that the corn stalks were now dried and yellow and it appeared that something dark brown was standing there in the middle of the corn stalks.  The roadway was slightly elevated above this particular field so I was essentially looking down onto the tops of cornstalks rather than them being level with the van. Having an interest in the subject of Bigfoot, I immediately went into observation mode and noted the following:  What I saw was medium to dark brown in color, it was taller than the cornstalks, it appeared to be about 3 feet wide and I may have been looking at a head and shoulders and it definitely wasn't a piece of farm equipment, a scarecrow or a human.  In fact, I noted that there were no humans around on the farm at the time.  I was able to observe this for roughly 5-10 seconds as our minivan drove past this large field.  The brown ""thing"" was roughly 300 feet in off the road in the cornfield by itself. I quickly tried to note the general location of where we were at the time.  I do not live in Delaware and was not familiar with the precise location.  However, not long after that, I spotted a sign for the Milton, Delaware exit off of Route 1.",,Sussex County,Delaware,Summer,38.88665,-75.3793,8/16/10,28720,Class B,90.98,83.6,76.22,0.24,Mostly cloudy in the morning and humid throughout the day.
"On 11-13-12 my wife and I just returned from the store and I stayed out by the car as she walked in the house after a couple minutes of me messing with her phone and some slight music playing on speaker, I heard the most blairing scream I have ever heard in my life and to follow. 4 blasting knocks. I screamed for my wife and told her I believe I just heard a squatch, she rolled her eyes and said if you would stop trying to call them after you watch the show they wouldn't come and then 4 more loud knocks. She went back into the house and while I stood there I could here the trees moving around, I have been watching the show and joking with the kids and wife with calling them in the rear of our wooded lot but after hearing this I can honestly say they are out there. This couldn't have been 100ft away from me and was so loud that it felt like it was next to me, I don't know if it was the light music playing that had it let me hear it or the practice calling in the rear yard but there are definitly BIG FOOTS IN DELAWARE",When you come from Milton on route 30 heading east towards Millsboro you come to xxxxxxx Rd and take a right the home is in the wooded area down about 1/2 mile.

"I didn't actually see anything. My wife woke me up around 1:30 am. She was giving me a hard time for the smell in the cabin (she thought I was passing gas). I told her it wasn't me. I had the window open and the fan was on blowing the cold air on me. There was this stench coming from outside. It was the most horrible smell I have ever smelled in my  life. It was a mix of nasty fecal matter (diarrhea) and body sweat/odor. I immediately shut the fan off and the smell started to go away. I didn't even think about going outside until later on in the morning about 10:00 am when we were eating breakfast. We hadn't mentioned anything to our kids but my son said he didn't sleep well the night before. He said he heard something outside of the cabin and thought it was probably a deer but he kept waking up feeling like something was staring at him through the window in the living room. Every time he would wake up, he'd look at the window. He said he thought for sure something was outside of the window staring at him. If indeed there was something or someone outside of the window staring at him then they would have to be at least 7 - 8 feet tall because the window is about that high off of the ground outside of the cabin. I didn't know if this incident was worth mentioning but I thought I would share it anyway. I did go outside and carefully searched the area around the cabin for any tracks but couldn't see any but our own and our dogs. Our dog was inside of the cabin sleeping in her crate in, the kitchen.

"On or about 00:30 Hours (12:30 AM), February 10, 2015, give or take 30 minutes, I was on my way home from work.  I work in Overland Park, Kansas and live in Lansing, Kansas.  I have been working a special project and my hours are from 3 PM to Midnight.  I was driving North on K-7 Highway just past Leavenworth Road near Falcon Estates Subdivision when a very large animal darted across the road in front of me running on two feet.  I did not slow down and was only able to see the back end of the animal.  The only thing in my mind right now is the fur pattern that I saw.  The fur looked a little longer than my hair which would make the hair about 2 to 3 inches and a little darker than color tan but a lighter color than the color brown, more of a dirty blond, it had waves in the hair, almost curly in areas.  It was larger and faster than any deer that I have ever seen in the area.  The size could be a large horse or elk.  I am glad that I did not hit it because of its size it would have totaled my car.  I cannot be 100% sure but it could have been a Big Foot.  The tail bone was about even to the middle of my driver’s side window.  I drive a Ford Focus.  I was just amazed by the fur color and texture.","K-7 / US 73 Highway runs north and south along the Leavenworth/Wyandotte county line.

I had lived in this area for about 5 years and had just recently moved. In the years of living in this area and being an avid bow hunter, I have observed lots of deer crossing the road just around this bend. I slowed down because the sun had set not long before and the deer move at that time.  As I came around the bend, I realized there was  something in the road in the oncoming lane. I slowed down futher, it was crossing the road into my lane. I rapidly slowed and swirved left to go behind it. I almost hit it, missed it less than a foot.

"My son's father and I came over from Oklahoma to the Buffalo National River area. I picked a waterfall out of my waterfall guide book that we were going to go find. We chose Hideout Hollow. When we pulled up to the parking area at the trailhead he turned off the car. Our windows were down because we were both smoking a cigarette. At that time I heard what sounded like if you were in the bathroom and heard your dog sniffing under the door.  I asked him in a whisper “Did you hear that?”  He said “That sounded like heavy machinery off in the distance.”  I let it go because I was just grateful he acknowledged the sound. We started to head down the trail when I realized we left our hiking sticks in the car, so I ran to get them myself. I had a slightly creeped out feeling but didn’t worry about it too much because I could still see him the whole time. Once I got back to him we started down the trail. We were just starting to round the corner that goes to the left when we heard a rustling in the trees to our left. We both stopped started and looked. We saw a huge figure running through the trees. I thought it was a man at first until I realized it was totally covered in hair, medium chocolate brown in color. I remember seeing it’s arms in front of it as if it was moving branches away to protect its face and its hands were black. I whispered “what was that?” He whispered back “I have no idea” I whispered “do you wanna go back?” And he nodded his head yes quickly. The direction it was going, it would’ve crossed the trail just around the curve. We turned around and started walking quickly back towards the car, both of us constantly looking over our shoulder behind us. I started asking questions to make sure we saw the same thing and neither of us forgot. We agreed it was on its hind legs, it was brown, it was a lot bigger than us and it was fast. Suddenly something flew fast over our heads (a rock?) hitting leaves and branches. I turned at looked at my son's dad with a “what the heck?” look on my face and his eyes were huge. We ran the rest of the way to the car. I had never been so scared and I wasn’t sure we would make it back to the car. We did and immediately he began second guessing what we had just seen, suggesting maybe it was a bear, a deer, an elk, etc. I asked him if he’s ever seen a bear run like that on it’s hind legs, or a deer or elk that dark running that smooth, he said no. We went to the Tea Kettle falls area but I was too scared and anxious to get out of the car again, convinced whatever it was could have easily covered ground by then. A Google search once we had service said only black bears live in Arkansas and I’m positive what we saw was brown. I didn’t notice any smells but since we were talking I also didn’t notice if it was quiet or if any birds or bugs were chirping.

"In October 2010 I was bow hunting on Camp Robinson military compound in North Little Rock, AR on Approximately 23,000 acres. I was hunting between two mountain ridges in the bottom of the valley approximately 100 yards from a thick creek bottom. I started the afternoon hunt at 2:30 pm finding my way to a new stand set up. I hunted all afternoon seeing alot of good deer sign in the area. After what started to be a promising day in the deer woods. I did not see a deer all day and the sun starting going down behind the mountain ridge to my west. It was getting so dark out that I could no longer see thru my peep sight. So, I decided to start packing up my backpack and start my decent down the tree. By now, it was well after dark and without my headlamp I could not see 3 foot in front of me. As I started to make my way down the tree. I heard the most disturbing sound in the woods that I have ever heard in my life. It was a very, very, loud, deep toned, gravely, blood curdling Growl/yell which seemed to be approximately 150/200 yards away from me to my southeast. It sounded as if someone was trying to yell for help. I immediately froze to the side of the tree and tried to gather my thoughts on what it could be. I originally thought that it was a person in the woods trying to play a prank on me. Mainly, because I had seen a pickup truck drive down the distant ridge several hours earlier. Then I realized that it was too loud to be a human screaming in the woods. I remained frozen to the side of the tree for several more minutes and tried to gather my thoughts of what could have made that sound. I am 43 years old and have been an avid hunter every year in some capacity since I was 6 years old and I have never heard anything like this in my life. After several minutes I finally made my way to the base of the tree, packed my stand, grabbed my bow and started to walk out on the trail that I walked in on into the direction of the ""sound"". I had about a 50 yard SE walk towards the ""sound"" then 100 yards west to an old logging road then 300 yards north back to where my truck was parked beside a small pond. So, as i left the tree walking SE and arrived at the west trail. I got a very uneasy feeling like something was watching me. So, I stopped to listen. Its was then I heard the ""sound"" again. It appeared to be moving closer to my location and approximately 50 yards away. Needless to say, I did not stick around to see what it was, for all I had was a headlight, bow in hand and a gut knife on my hip. So, I immediately start sprinting toward my truck. I have NEVER been so scared in my entire life. I started my truck and got the hell out of there. On my drive out of Camp Robinson. I called several of my closest friends and my dad and told them of the encounter. I stayed up all night on the internet to research this sound that I heard in the woods that night. I listened to mountain lions, african lions, tigers, bears, bobcats, foxes, coyotes, wild boars, etc... and I could not find anything that would come close to what I heard. The very next day. I drove back to the same area at Camp Robinson where I heard the ""sound"". Again right at dark from the comfort of my pickup truck with a pistol in my hand. I heard the sound again further down the valley approximately 1/4 to 1/2 mile away. I was a very distinct sound, very loud.... Since, these three occurrences. I have hunted at Camp Robinson on many more occasions and I have not heard this ""sound"" again. Still baffles me to this day of what I heard those two nights and I have still never heard anything like it.",East of West Boundry Road between Clifton Mountain Rd and Demolition Road on Camp Robinson Military base.,Pulaski County,Arkansas,Fall,34.92684,-92.30753,10/30/10,39922,Class B,71.77,56.58,41.39,0.76,Clear throughout the day.
"I saw an unidentified animal around 7:55 P.M. on 12/7/12 on the side of the road with gray fur I was driving at night on I-40 W from Little Rock to Conway around the 144 marker. It was on the right hand side of the road and was in a slumped/ sitting position. The animal was very large and had long gray/silver/black hair but mostly a dirty light gray. The best view of the animal I got was the broad side of its back.  The widest part of the body was at the elbows and it appeared to be about 4.5ft wide. From what appeared to be the head to the ground was about 5.5 ft tall. As I passed by I tried slowing down and was able to see  a profile shot of the animal. It appeared to be sitting looking at something on the ground. I would guess that it could be a deer that was hit by a car. I see deer at night on the sides of the road here almost every night coming through this area. The size of the animal was scaled to a road sign I saw just before the sighting. It was a large 4x4 sign that was turned backwards so all I could only see is the gray back. Minuets later after I saw the sign, the same distance from the road and slightly down the embankment was the anima (about 1.5-2 ft away from the white line).  The hair was similar to that of those long haired cows all over the body but still was able to see muscles under the hair very similar to a gorilla. After it happened I was not sure what I saw. I tried to classify the animal. To this day I have no ideas for sure what I saw. I have seen hundreds of animals at night driving and this was the first thing I could not ID. The animal had an eerie resemblance to a Bigfoot. At the time I had never heard of a Bigfoot with light colored hair and until I saw an episode of Finding Bigfoot where an eye whitness saw a white colored Bigfoot. I am open to any possibilities of the ID of this animal. Please let me know the BFRO's thoughts.

There is a small creek bed in the curve with a large culvert running under the road connecting both sides of the street in that area.  Just past the curve I saw a tall, upright, black figure.  It was about 10 yards past the beginning of the treeline.  This creature was walking at an angle through the woods towards the creek.  I saw his right profile and the back of him. It appeared to have arms which were hanging at his side. There are lots of trees in this area so parts of his profile were blocked at times.  All of the leaves are off the trees at this so I had a pretty clear view.  He appeared to be 6-7 feet tall with black hair.  I'm not exactly sure what I saw but I know that it wasn't a deer.  This road has a pretty high amount of traffic in the morning and is highly guarded by Camp Robinson.",Bateville-Pike begins just past the North Little Rock airport (Remount Rd).  The sighting occurred just before the 1st major curve if you are traveling south on Bateville-Pike.  I saw the creature on the Camp Robinson side of the road.

"Sitting in tree during deer season. Saw a dark figure in deep brush, as i watch it moved into an open spot. I didn't Know what it was so i looked through the scope of my gun, not having binoculars on me, and saw it standing next to a cedar tree, with its hand on the tree. It turned profile to me and noticed that it wasn't any person in a custom as i thought it was at first. it was about 7'5"" tall deep brown color, had hair from nose down, the face was deep wrinkled and the eyes had no whites, they were colored kind of. Scared i clicked the safety of my gun off, and the creature let out a deep grunt, way too deep to be any bear. It ran into the thick brush. A little while later i walked down to where it was to see if i could figure out what it was. I saw an imprint in the bark like a thumb and two long scratches that were as far apart as my pointer and pinkie streched.",Winona wildlife area,Saline County,Arkansas,Fall,34.73147,-92.75093,11/18/10,29417,Class A,51.18,45.225,39.27,0.4,Foggy in the morning.
"I live in rural part of Sevier County, Arkansas.  On 2/6/11 I went out to feed my dogs. They are tied out about 150 yards from my house. As I was feeding the dogs I noticed a large barefoot track measuring about 13.25 inches long and 5.5 inches at the widest part  and 4 inches at the instep.  I saw only one right footprint as the snow was melting quickly. I found another track west of the house about 300 yards from the first one. It was more melted so the toes were not as clear. Track was also right foot.

Hi BFRO my sighting happen nine months ago near Searcy Arkansas I was hunting on Thanksgiving day. It was getting dark when I had a rock thrown over my head which freaked me out so I quickly turned around and lifted my shotgun and light and look up and down the tree line until I came up on a big oak and I saw what looked like a Sasquatch looking at me from behind the oak and it yelled at me with a low grunt and high pitch scream so I jumped and actually took a shot and hit the tree and it took off running back down the line towards a valley.,A public hunting grounds.,White County,Arkansas,Fall,35.255,-91.50301,11/26/15,55410,Class A,70.41,65.455,60.5,0.54,Overcast throughout the day.
"Around 5pm I was driving down hwy 258 to go to the store. We have had some recent flooding so I was driving slower than normal and watching for deer. Along the way I seen 2 different area of deer, one had 3 I could see the other there was at least 6. So on the way back from the store I knew to slow down in those areas just in case. In one area it is a rather sharp curve and I had seen the most deer there. As I came up on the curve I slowed down and suddenly something jumped out in front of the car!!! I'll call it a ""he from here out.""  He seem to have been running from the pine tree line and took a, what I would call a leap, out onto the road then he was gone. It was only 1 maybe two steps on the road it's self to clear it! I had slammed on the brakes and just sit there in awe wondering if I really seen what I had.  He was standing on two legs, lots of fur and what I would assume Is at least 8 foot tall. When he jumped in front of the car he was about a car length in front of me. He looked to have had a large fish in his hand. I know how that sounds but I swear it was a long fish. My husband said it may have been a stick but I'm a country girl and I know my fish! His ""fur"" was longer than what bear fur would be and although he was dark brown it had a reddish hue to it, the headlights gave s good look at the color as it leaped across.  There is a lake back behind where he was running from but he also jumped across to the right where those 6 plus deer were standing. We are going back at first light to see if he left foot prints. It's so muddy I'm hoping to see some.  We hear sounds out here almost nightly of what we describe as big foot sounds but I've honestly never thought they was out here. It is just sounds you can't describe, so we call it bigfoot sounds. I've had several friends and family hear them and one of them will not stay outside long out here because she's heard it so much. When I got home my husband came to the door to help bring stuff in and ask what was wrong, I said the deer are out bad and he asked if I hit one, I said no and he asked why was I shaking. I didn't realize my whole body was still shaking! LoL  I started telling him and I had tears rolling down, heart pounding and still shaking so bad. It really shook me up so much.  Not sure what else to say. It was one of the most amazing yet scariest things I've ever seen. I know I will not sleep tonight due to thinking about it and what exactly happened.","Going north on 67/167 take the second Bald Knob exit, turn left and go under over pass, then turn left onto Hwy 258, about two miles down in the curve.",White County,Arkansas,Winter,35.34737,-91.60007,12/28/15,50541,Class A,50.92,43.935,36.95,0.61,Heavy rain in the morning and breezy in the afternoon.

"I'm still wondering if I should be telling this since it's still hard for me to believe what happened while hiking an old logging road in Cedarville, Arkansas located in Crawford County. My parent's had just bought a home. We had been in the home for about a year now at this point and I had now a very good knowledge of all the forest area around us. And as a 15 year old boy I loved going out into the wood's finding deer antler's and going on hikes up to the old forestry observance tower. This particular Friday I had planned to take my pup tent and a little food with me and go camping like I had done several time's before. I started my hike with my best friend, Chris H. who was staying over for the weekend to go camping with me. We left the house right after he arrived, around 5pm and we got to where we were going to camp out at around 7pm high up on the mountain which is a long, hard and treacherous hike by any means. We set up out tent and made a nice fire and started to cook hot dogs when I needed to go to the bathroom so I went off into the wood's to do natures business. Shortly after digging a hole I heard something being thrown through the branches. This happened about 4 or 5 time's and I thought it was Chris clowning around and I yelled at him to stop throwing stuff at me, I then heard him yell back that he didn't throw anything to quit playing games that if I throw something again he was going to throw something at me. It didn't make sence, I wasn't throwing anything at him, I was pulling my pants back up when I was hit with a stick about an inch in diameter and about a foot long that was freshly ""twisted"" off of a tree. I got back and had the stick that hit me in my hand because I was going to hit Chris with it since he hit me but he was in his tent and I asked him to come out and he said he wasnt that he was mad at me for throwing stuff at him that he got into the tent so he wouldnt get hit. About that time we heard low, long grunting burping sounds that started out quiet and got louder towards the end of each grunt, I didn't know what it was but it was getting louder each time, it would make the noise 3 or 4 times and stop and then the sound of something being beaten on with what reminded me of hitting a baseball bat aginst a tree but really hard and then hard thud sounds like it was being hit on the ground and then the grunting would start again. By this time me and Chris were scared, I had a 22 rifle with me that my dad made me always take camping if it were just us kid's in case of coyotes. I got the 22 out of the tent and Chris got the light and shined it into the wood's and about 25 yard's from us we saw a very tall man standing there beside a tree as soon as the light hit his area, he ducked behind the tree but we noticed with the light he was huge, around 7 foot tall at least and was wearing what reminded me of a gillie suite that hunters wear, all covered with a redish brown fur. And the smell that was coming from it was awful. It reminds me of road kill and a wet dog combined together. I didnt even dare using the rifle because I knew that if you shot anything large with a .22 you're just going to do much to it because even a deer wont drop with a .22 and this person or thing was a lot bigger than a deer or a bear which are in the area. Me and Chris backed up slowly,poured water on the fire, we were  still hearing the grunts but not the same sounding grunt's, these were now more of a growling ooohhhh sound. We finally turned and using the light to keep from breaking out necks ran as fast as we could. I havent been hiking or camping since, don't ever plan to go again and will not live near any forest areas much less in. We moved from Cedarville 2 years later and I haven't been back since and won't be for as long as I live. Me and Chris dont even talk about that night. We both had nightmares for a long time about that night. I know what I heard, smelled and seen and never want to see it again. Now I live in Las Vegas, Nevada and I'm fine without the forest and trees. You will never get me in them again because I know what's in them.",Location was 4 miles from home near a old forest watch-tower,Crawford County,Arkansas,Fall,35.36335,-94.229,3/23/10,27482,Class A,73.62,61.03,48.44,0.26,Clear throughout the day.
"My children and I were driving back from my mothers home in Cushman, AR on Thanksgiving day around 10 PM. We were approaching Newark on hwy 65 south. Just outside of Newark, Macedonia Road turns off the hwy to the left. We had to stop for traffic as we came up on that road. There were 2 cars in front of us...the 1 in front was waiting to turn left onto Macedonia Rd. There were 3 cars in oncoming traffic and 1 car on Macedonia Rd waiting to turn left onto hwy 65 toward Newark. As our truck slowed due to the stopped traffic ahead of us, I saw something very dark in a crouched position behind the car directly in front of us. As the vehicles started to move the figure stood and stepped all in one motion off the side of the hwy. It was on 2 legs and taller that the cab of our full size pick up. In the crouched position it was taller than the hood of my truck. You could see the profile of a head, shoulders, back, buttocks, legs and arms swinging wide. I was speechless. My daughter, 11 at the time, also saw  the figure and said ""Did you see that??"" As she locked her door. I was a MAJOR skeptic until this. It really left me scratching my head.

"Heading west on I-40 today at 0930 my wife and I saw a Bigfoot 100-150 yards from the hwy heading north. It was not running, but walking. It never looked at the hwy. It must have been 7-8 ft tall.

"My Wife and I went up to the Mogollon Rim north of Woods Canyon Lake to camp for two days. We took our two small dogs with us. I thought if we went during the week there wouldn't be many people there and I was right. We set up camp in the rain at about 2pm. It rained till about 6pm we saw no one just these big trucks going back in forth on the road till about 5pm. It was very dark and we were trying to start a fire but everything was wet and all we had was a dull ax to chop wood. I believe we were being very noise hacking at the dead wood we were trying to cut to size for our fire. After we got the fire going we cook our dinner and ate. It was very quiet no sound at all then we saw a large full moon rising from the east it lit up the sky. We decided to go to bed around 10pm I put some more wood on the camp fire hoping it would burn all night. As we were in our tent the moon was like a big night light then we fell asleep. At about 3:10am I woke up to a sound that was unlike anything I have ever heard both our dogs sat up and were very still. It was like as if someone was screaming thru a loud PA system it was very clear. I woke my wife so she could hear the sound but it had stop then again it started we were both laying there trying to figure out what could be large in size that would make a sound so loud and long it was echoing in the canyon to the north of us. Then it stop it must of lasted about 5 to 10 min at the most. We stayed in our tent for about a 1/2hr but we both needed to GO if you know what I mean. So we put our shoes on I grab my wife's 9mm and we stepped out of our tent we could see all around us because of the full moon light. After taking care of business we went back into our tent and went to bed. I wont lie it was hard to me to fall asleep. The next morning after breakfast I took one of our dogs out for a walk in the direction the screams came from and saw nothing but about 200yard in the same direction I found what looked to be a possible shelter made from dead trees about 12 to 15 feet long and 4 to 5"" in diameter. they were set up standing like a teepee there was one tree laying on the ground next to the structure I tried to lift it and found it was so heavy that I don't think two large men could pick it up much less stand it up like the rest. One other thing I saw was the trees were saw cut but there were no tree stumps around so the trees had to be carried there from else where. If someone did this for fun they had to work hard to do this and I cant see why. The first night we were there no one was camping any where near us but the second day we were there some campers set up about 1/2 mile to the north on the other side of the canyon. That night our dogs were on edge looking out away from camp and growling my wife said she could hear something large moving around in the woods to the west of us but when shining a spot light in that direction she didn't see anything. I put some more wood on our fire then we went to bed.

"While in flagstaff, AZ, my husband, mother-in-law, and I decided to take a chairlift ride. As we drove up snow bowl rd to reach the Arizona Snowbowl, we saw a large tall figure walking in long strides through the trees. I would say about 40 yards from the desolate road. As an avid ""Finding Bigfoot"" watcher, our sighting was everything we heard/saw on the show. The squatch had to have been at least 8 or 9 feet tall. It was too far away to make out any features, but the way it walked, the posture, and dark brown/black color it was unmistakeable. Definitely not a bear or deer.

"It was a Sunday afternoon in late June 2016. I was camped in a developed USFS campground (CG) on the Coconino National Forest in central Arizona in the Mogollon Rim area. The CG is situated in an canyon within a mixed forest of spruce, fir, oak, aspen, and mainly Ponderosa pine. The cliff edge of the Rim is about 3/4 mile South of the CG. I was sitting in the shade and had just finished reading a work of fiction by James Patterson which had a strange ending. I was musing about the ending and just looking West across the CG when a very fast moving dark figure crossed the CG heading from North to South. My first thought was of a large kid on a bicycle as it was moving so fast on the in camp gravel road. But its' travel path was counter to the road. Then I realized what it was that I had seen. It was a very large Bigfoot. The sighting only lasted about three seconds and I was very lucky to have seen it at all. It crossed the CG in a shaded area and blended well into its' background but the meadow beyond it to the West was bathed in afternoon Sunlight and backlit the dark figure. It was about 125 yards from my viewpoint so facial detail was not clear. It ran with a slight forward cant to its' body. I noted that the head did not bob up and down like a human runners head at speed. The coat was almost black looking but with the back lighting I noticed a slight reddish tint to the figures profile as it passed by. I had not noticed its legs or arm movement. Later, I went over to where the figure had crossed. On the North side of the drainage area, there was an area of crushed grass near the beginning of the travel path. Then the figure had moved South across the in camp road and had gone into a depression in the high grass. There were other areas of crushed grass along its' suspected travel path. Also a crushed fern near the split rail fence that bordered the CG where I suspect it had stepped over, crossed the forest road, and went into thick timber. I believe the Earth depression and a row of large logs obscurred my view of its'legs as it passed by. I had only seen its' torso from the hips up but did note that the figure did not appear to have much of a neck, if any. The torso was very thick and I guessed it was a least twice the thickness of a human. It was a once in a lifetime event and as I said, I was very lucky to have seen the Sasquatch at all. Truly, an awesome event which I will carry in my minds eye forever.",The sighting was in the Kehl Springs CG at Mile Post #7 (GPS info was taken and is available upon request),Coconino County,Arizona,Summer,34.43542,-111.3164,6/26/16,55195,Class B,84.33,72.13,59.93,0.72,Clear throughout the day.
"Memorial Day weekend 2013.  Arrived with my husband and two kids to Cunningham site Mt Graham on May 25 2013.  Two relatives campers were already at the site set up.  We only had a 5 person tent and a car.  May 25 was uneventful we camped, ate walked two dogs had birthday party at night with son.  May 26, got up early spent time in camp having coffee, did normal camping activities, except around 1030 am went for hike with my husband, daughter(12), son(11).  Our campsite was in front of the restrooms at Cunningham site and we hiked the trail behind the restroom on the right. Walked to trail for less than a block and stopped in front of wild raspberry bushes.  My husband commented on how he used to go eat these when he was a kid camping in the Graham's.  Started walking again, went up a hill, my daughter hit her walking stick on a tree. Seconds later, a large tree is heard falling up in the forest nearby at top of hill above us.  We walked a short way and then decided that it was too steep and turned around.  Went back to raspberry bush and took pictures for a few moments.  Went back to site as we were walking back I was in the back of the group and heard a twig snap behind me as if someone was there.  I turned around to watch but nothing was seen.  This occurred twice.  Went to camp had uneventful day.  Went to bed in our tent around 9 pm.  One camper that was behind our tent (we had our tent on the corner of the road by the bathrooms.) went home in the early afternoon.  With one camper left to our left, we were close to the forest by the bathroom.  We went to bed, opening of tent was to the forest.   Slept on the left side on a cot.  Dogs and kids went to bed quickly.  I finally nodded off to sleep.  Around 1 or 2 am my husband woke up and needed air.  He stepped outside the tent with his flashlight and was there for about 2 minutes.  As he came into the tent his flashlight was shining around the tent. Seconds later a person's figure was seen walking quickly in front where my husband was just standing.  My daughter and I were both awake and said ""someone is outside"". She heard slipper feet nearby the tent on the road. We went back to sleep.  I awoke later do not know what time to hear someone behind the tent eating. There is no vegetation just trees.  It was chewing and lip smacking loudly, like someone with no manners.  our tent has side panels which are open but with a tarp on top of our tent because the night before was very cold.  I could tell that it was tall because it was above me, and tried to listen to identify it. No bear, no deer not footstep sound.  About 15 minutes later, a sound was heard down the road.  The chewing stopped.  Resumed chewing a minute later. This went on for awhile, no other animal sounds, no birds even though a mexican whippoorwill was singing all night the night before.  I turned toward the sound and smelled out the netting and it smelled like an animal.  Later, a sound was heard in the distance like someone was out of there camper door.  The chewing stopped, the thing was gone without a sound, no footsteps.  I went back to sleep. My family talked about it the next day, but went on with our activities and left that day. I had no knowledge of bigfoot in southern Arizona prior to looking it up a few days after getting home.  My friend joked when I got home that if was Bigfoot.

"I was camping at Mt. Graham about 1:00 am when I awoke and heard some rhythmic tapping of some type.  About 30 yards away in a very wooded area. Seconds later I heard steps walking around my tent. No breathing occurred just the sound of something walking. And it never went into the reflection of my tent and my lantern light. My sister, husband, son and their hound dog were in a tent 10 feet away and I could hear their dog whimpering.  I awaken my dad and told him I think its a bear. So we got our shoes, gun and flashlight. My 3 nieces were sleeping in the tent adjacent to my sister's tent. Then from inside this tent my niece screamed. (Later they told us they all heard steps and heavy breathing, and heard sounds from two individuals she said sounded like they where communicating and could hear them run away.) When we heard my niece yell in fear we got out of the tent fast with our flashlight aiming in their direction. But it was gone. It had to move extremely fast or just be hiding and did not make a sound because we were out of the tent in 2 seconds of the scream. We were already getting up to check some noise and do the late night restroom when at 4:00 am we could hear rocks and chattering within 1 second about 50 yards in the dense wooded area.",Mt.

"I was driving towards Show Low on US 60 about 2:00 in the afternoon on March 24th, 2010. I always look out into the trees in hopes of seeing deer and turkeys, but this time I saw something a bit more out of the ordinary. I saw a very large and tall animal which was about the same redish brown color as a Herford cow, standing about halfway behind a large pine tree. Its arm was very long and it was probably 7ft or more in height. I hit the brakes and slowed way down to get a better look and when doing so, it rotated to make itself more hidden from view. It was too large for the tree it was behind, and now it was visible on both sides of the tree. It definately saw me. I couldn't see its eyes, but it kept its head visible to look at me.

"On approximately April 22,14 I was at Fools Hollow Lake near Showlow, AZ I was out on the lake around the bend fishing where a storm was starting to roll in from the east as the storm was getting closer I was becoming more uncomfortable so I decided to start heading in. I was heading west when I spotted what I thought was a bear down on all four drinking water from the edge of the lake my approximate coordinates were 34.277763, -110.071018 and when I first spotted the creature its coordinates were 34.277126, -110.072090 off the point at the bend of the lake (the lake is a sideways ""L"" shape. As I got closer to the creature still thinking it was a large black bear I saw it stand up on its two hind legs and look towards me. The creature then turned and walked into the wooded area behind it where I lost sight of it. The small time frame in which I did see the creature walking depicted very similarly to the Patterson video this creature about 7-8' tall longer arm length reaching towards its mid thigh and walking with a very long stride and a hunch. The creature appeared to have a reddish brown color to it a few shades darker than an orangutan. After losing sight of the creature I was unable to catch it in my sight again. With the storm right behind me and lightning all around I did not want to be on the lake in a 12' aluminum boat so I headed back to shore.","34.277126, -110.072090",Navajo County,Arizona,Spring,34.285,-110.11,4/22/14,47536,Class A,73.68,60.38,47.08,0.77,Clear throughout the day.

"My wife and I were camping in the Cleveland National Forest, Mount Laguna area. [East of San Diego] The campground is called Burnt Rancheria. It was exactly 3:14am. My wife woke me up because she needed to use the restroom really bad.  The restroom was about 50 yards away and she was afraid to go alone.  As I was putting on my shoes, I started hearing sounds that reminded me of an ax hitting wood (or a tree), but louder.  It wasn’t like someone was cutting wood, because the sounds were not in rapid succession, they were 2 or 3 seconds apart. In total I think I heard 4 or 5 of them.  I put on my shoes, stepped out of my tent, and kept hearing them, finally realizing that they sounded like the “knocking sounds” described by people who have reported bigfoot encounters. After about 5 seconds they stopped, and (I don’t know if this was just my imagination or not) I started to hear echoes of “voices”.  I say voices because it sounded like someone talking but at the same time it was gibberish with grunts. The next day my sister in law, who was camping with us, started to give us a hard time about all the noise we were making getting out of the tent and going to the rest room.  So I asked her if she heard the “knocking sounds” she said she did. She described them as someone dropping a heavy rock on a ply wood.  I asked my wife if she heard them but she said she was still half asleep and trying not to wet herself.  I’ve seen the show “Finding Bigfoot” and know what sounds sasquatches reportedly make, but I never thought I would actually hear them.",We were in the Burnt Rancherias Campground in the Cleveland National Forest.,San Diego County,California,Summer,32.81075,-116.4208,7/22/12,36070,Class B,79.02,68.325,57.63,0.12,Clear throughout the day.
"We went camping for a couple nights near Julian, CA. in a location just a couple miles south of town adjacent to Hwy 79. We arrived on a Friday night and stayed thru Sunday afternoon. We were sharing a tent trailer with friends. Both mornings before dawn I walked my wife over to the nearby porta-potty/restroom. Both nights were clear and quite dark with partial moonlight but the area has a lot of trees so there are shadows even though you can see well enough to walk over to the restrooms without a flashlight. The first morning we walked over to the bathroom without incident and it's very quiet there, especially in the evenings. The second morning probably about 0540 as I waited for my wife I very clearly heard a tree knock. It came from north of our location. When my wife came out of the restroom I told her what I heard and asked her if she heard it. She did not. We walked back to the tent trailer and got back in bed as the sun was not rising until closer to 0700. We were both awake about 15 minutes later and both heard a single whoop sound this time from a bit to the east. Right after the whoop sound was heard there were blue jays in the trees around us that went nuts making all kinds of noise for about 20 seconds then all was quiet again. A bit later, still before dark, I got up and kindled the fire a bit outside and decided to take my vehicle up the road to drop some trash off near the campground office. Another friend from a second tent trailer also camping with us was up at this time. I told her about the tree knock and whoop that was heard. When I returned from the quick errand to the trash bin. She told me she had also heard a tree knock, but this time it was to our west. A few minutes later I heard 2 more whoops one from the south east then a couple minutes after that to the south. These were not coyotes yipping. Not sure what else to say about it but it was interesting!",The tree knocks and whoops were heard while camping at Pinezanita Campground.

"Three friends enjoying an all day ride up to the snow in Whiskeytown National Park. We were all on horseback. We spotted what appeared to be Bigfoot tracks in the snow. We got off our horses for close examination and could clearly see the toes in the snow. Two of the witnesses are RN's. I am an Appraiser. What made this sighting of tracks credible to me were the existence of so many other tracks, including bear, that gave good comparison to other critters and size.  The tracks came up out from the gulch, followed the road a bit, then back down into the gulch. Also my friend noticed smaller Bigfoot tracks coming down from a very steep draw on the left of the road. There were no tracks going up, just coming down, as if to ""join"" the others. It was still very cold when we first saw these tracks, but they were melting when we rode back through this area many hours later.","South side of Whiskeytown Lake, Whiskeytown National Recreation Area.

This happened back around 2014 although I didn't realize it until I read something about it. I was on Shasta Lake riding my Sea Doo one last time before I sold it. I had headed up the Pit river sometime in July. It was approximately sometime after 2 PM.  I had gone up quite a ways up toward the pot river and had decided to head back toward Jones Valley resort.  I always love to scan the ridges looking for shapes like you do when you hunt.  I came around a big  turn in the main channel and it was the most bizarre thing I had ever seen. About 20 feet from shore I see what I initially believed to be a big hairy head with eyes staring directly at me. I would say within a couple seconds it simply disappeared under the surface of the water. I was wearing sunglasses and I remember thinking  did I just see what I think I did?  I gave it a wide girth and slowed down and circled the area for about 2-3 minutes. I remember feeling freaked out a bit having this vision of it lunging out of the water at me.  Shortly after I continued back to Jones Valley resort and tried to put it out of my head. I wish now more than ever I would have taken the time to search for it but I just figured my initial thought had to be incorrect. I reasoned naturally it had to be something else. A beaver? Muskrat? I can't say for sure what it was but I know it was big. I do know my original feeling was it was a big hairy head and face with eyes. It had appeared to be wet already like it had already submerged previously. It was dark brown and tan in color. I know it was not a human. There were no boats anywhere near where I was and it was pretty secluded.,,Shasta County,California,Summer,40.7729,-122.1024,7/15/14,59668,Class B,94.37,82.21,70.05,0.62,Clear throughout the day.
"This happened on my way to work last summer a few days after the Delta Fire broke out and the Carr Fire was about to connect with Delta Fire. I was driving up to work from Redding. I worked at a school in Whitmore, California, in Shasta County, that was only accessible from a logging road. As I was going up the mountain, I rounded a corner and about 300 feet from me and maybe 400 feet front tintagel lane, a tall hairy creature, dark brown with some gray along the back shoulders, walking on two legs, crossed the road (which is wide enough for 2 cars to pass each other) in about 2 steps and then was in the woods. The hair on the back of my neck instantly stood up, and I was terrified. I had my 11 month old son in the back seat, and I drove to campus as quickly as I could.

"I have been backpacking in the Trinity Alps for 12 years and have ran into many bears and even mountain lions but this experience was much different. My wife, brother, and another friend of ours went packing to Bear Lake in the trinity alps. It was our last night and we were the only ones at the lake. Since it was in August fire wood was scarce and we had none for our last night. We sat in our dark camp until about midnight then everyone wanted to sleep. My brother and our friend shared a tent and my wife and I shared one. I lay in my tent and couldn't sleep. I looked at the time and it was 1:30 am. My wife was asleep and I heard what I thought was my brother walking around in camp. It walked around for at least a minute so I whispered my brothers name to see if it was him but it kept walking around and not responding which made me very nervous. I heard the steps getting closer to my tent and I started to smell a horrible animal stench. I had left my backpack leaning against a log about 15 feet from our tent. Whatever it was walked over and picked up my pack off the ground and was holding it above my tent. I could see the shadow of something very large  standing outside the tent trying to rip open my pack as it held it above our tent which had no food in it., Our food pack was up in a tree on the other side of camp with only freeze dried food.

"Hello. My family and I took a trip to the Sequoia National Forest and were walking a trail near the Bear Hill Trail. I was taking pictures and videos of my children when I noticed a couple of footprints up the side of the hill.  The toes and heel indentations were very noticeable, very large and very deep into the dirt. The stride between the prints were approximately 6 feet apart. I also took photos and videos of the prints and with my foot next to them. What was very intimidating was that I am 6'6"" and weigh 380 lbs., so I'm no small guy at all. I wear shoe size 13 extra wide. These prints made my foot look childish. I tried my hardest to dig my foot into the dirt as deep as the prints were, but to no avail. Whatever made these prints had to be a considerably large animal. I then went back to the entrance of the Bear Hill Trail and walked up that trail and matched the area where I found the original prints, but higher up. It was there I found a third print and took a couple of pictures of that print as well, with one being my foot next to it to get the size.

"You would be interested in what happened to me a year ago, and twice more in 24 hours, just 2 weeks ago, near the Humboldt Mendo County headwaters of the Matole River. I am absolutely convinced that some unknown animal exists here so I began on the internet a search for similar accounts.  While immersed in the Internet searching it became clear to me that your organization should have this most recent information in a timely manner. Last July 2018, I was staying in a very isolated region, which had very limited access, behind 3 locked gates and 20 miles south of Whitethorn, CA, on a primitive 4x4 road.  This place is at the end of the world, on the northern border of a vast green belt spreading from Shelter Cove on the coast, east to Highway 101,  and south to Fort Bragg, and east to Piercy, as can be seen on Google Earth. About 3 a.m. I was awake, it was a hot and dark night in these mountains.  Something above my tent location, approximately 200-300 meters, began knocking on wood, best described as loud whacks on a tree trunk by a big club or branch.  It started with one knock, which got my attention, with a brief hesitation, then several more knocks, but randomly timed, some in succession, others after hesitations.  The knocking was loud, so loud that it echoed down the canyon. The event lasted only a minute or two. My first thoughts were that there was no one on the mountain who could be out here in the middle of a primitive and protected area.  These knocks were obviously from something large, and no North American animal could have made them.  I listened intently while my mind tried to wrap around how the noise was made.  The woods were silent, not even a cricket.  I told a few locals afterward and learned that there were other hotspots for squatch sightings between Piercy and up to Willow Creek. Flash forward to two weeks ago, when waiting at the first locked gate to this same conservation area, I heard two distinct vocalizations which cannot be explained. As I waited in the dusk for about 45 minutes, waiting to meet a party at the gate who were running late, I heard a very loud wail/ scream/ call that I've never heard before in nature.  The call of this thing I located at about my 2 o'clock, facing east, and up the heavily wooded area above me, about 200-300 meters.  I instantly knew where I had heard such an unfamiliar call....about 3 years ago when watching a Bigfoot reality show, where these squatch hunters were making this strange/unique call while searching for Bigfoot. There was a few second delay from the first call, then a few more, then silence for about a minute, leaving me to wonder if this whole experience was real, pondering what I know about the wilderness, either that was an unknown animal or some kind of implausible prank.  It was loud, echoing down the mountain, as though some huge creature could belt like the lungs of Pavarotti, only much louder!  The chance of it being a prankster waiting in silence with me for 45 minutes in that remote location, just to hang out in these impenetrable woods and prank me, went away very quickly when, when another call out at about 3-400 meters to the north of the first, approx my 8 o'clock.  It was also just as loud, just as unique as the first, but came only 3 calls in succession, u-ah-o, u-ah-o, u-ah-o, with a distinct higher pitch on the ""ah"".  This absolutely blew my mind, because the first call might be an elk on steroids, but the response from what was clearly not an owl, brought chills down my spine.  This was some kind of communication between two individuals, neither which can be explained by any rationale. I must tell you that I have trekked and lived in remote areas in Africa, Australia, central and south America, many places of potential danger, and never had an inkling of fear.  I was born and raised near Yellowstone Park, with 100 times the average distance trekked by most individuals in their lifetime, and never had bad experiences with grizzly, mountain lions and wolves.  Travelling all these years with a firm understanding of ecosystems, I never could have believed in such mysteries, that anything new would ever be discovered. I had a fourth experience, which I must say something about, but it happened just the night before the dual vocalizations. On Friday evening, Nov 1st, 2019, I had just moved into a cabin that my brother and I rented, located along an extremely rugged canyon area of the Matole River.  It was dusk, quite dark already in the forest.  I was outside looking at the stars, taking in the newness of these rugged surroundings.  Up above, again about 300 meters up and to the east of the river, there was a screaming that was so loud and so foreboding that I could only listen in amazement.  It was the loudest screaming I've ever heard, so loud I thought it was produced by some kind of banshees from a horror film. The screams continued, full throttle, for over 5 minutes.  I know mountain lions can scream, but nothing like this. It sounded much louder, more guttural, literally as if someone had set up a loud speaker and played the bloodiest scream that Hollywood could produce.  At the time, the night after Halloween, I wondered if someone was up on the mountainside pranking me as a newcomer to the neighborhood. I listened for a bit, then went inside and told my brother about it because it was so unnerving.  Bigfoot did not even enter my mind.  But then at dusk the next evening I witnessed these 2 calls waiting at the gate. I have since been over and over in my mind, why have I been so lucky as to hear or experience such mystery?  Much less 3 distinct vocalizations which cannot be explained.  I began pouring over USGS maps and satellite imagery to ascertain what the link may be, 20 miles apart, are there any people or neighbors or access for individuals in the areas I experienced which may explain these?  Could one individual in such obvious stress on one night, have triggered the coincidental travel of at least 2 more unknown creatures the very next night?? I have talked to many locals about hearing strange noises, but no one claims anything, or they don't want to be ridiculed. Look, I am a man, 60 yo, with extensive wilderness experience in forests and jungles all over the world.  The closest thing to new species discovery for me was the Costa Rican jungles, but my mind has always been as a skeptic observer, dealing in evidence based biology as a science.  What has happened to me recently has completely changed me!  There is a mystery in these woods, and I have a few ideas how to answer them. Please feel free to contact me, if you would like access to these remote locations.  And I am very curious if other people in my area are having similar experiences.  Something unexplained to science lives out here, and I am beside myself with these recent events. Troy Hunter,  troy.hntr@gmail.com.

"I was driving home from Brookings Oregon on 1-23-21. I was south bound on highway 101 south of Garberville, Ca and south of the Benbow Inn.  The road makes a few turns and the speed limit drops in the area. As I rounded a sweeping right hand turn I saw a figure on the south bound shoulder of the highway. I was the only vehicle in the area about 8:15 PM.   My speed was about 45-50 MPH as I passed the figure. The figure was laying on the shoulder of the road on its right side. I estimated the height to be about 7’. I was looking at the creatures back and noticed it had broad shoulders and was thick torso shape. While the shape similar to a human it was not human. It was not a bear either. I could see muscular features in its glutes and a head on the shoulders that was somewhat tapered toward the top and being held off the ground. It’s hair was a chocolate brown and very course. The hair was not fur like of a  bear at all. I turned around a distance past the spot and returned to where I had seen it.  No other vehicles had gone north or south from the time I saw the creature to the time I returned to its location (2 minutes estimate).

I started tapping on the window to let whoever was outside know they were being noisy and disrupting my effort to try to sleep.   After my third tap on the window, I woke up from my dream and realized I had to go to the bathroom.  I got up and made my way to the toilet.  My bedroom window was open and my bathroom window was open.  Just before I flushed, I heard a faint noise, and I started to think it was a motorcycle coming around the bend on the highway, and in that second I thought to myself “Who would be riding a motorcycle this early in the morning?”. Then, the noise got louder and drawn out, and had a deep vibrating howl, and then it stopped.  I realized then that it was something I have never heard before and it was not human.  It sounded like it was on one of the mountains behind my house. Afterwards, I noticed there were no dogs barking, not even my dogs, and there weren’t even any crickets.  It was dead silence outside.  I was telling myself, oh my god, did I just hear what I think I heard?  I headed back to bed and noticed the clock said 3:33am. I asked my husband if he was awake. He had been snoring when I was in the bathroom.  I told him I had just heard something.  I explained the sound to him and I said I think it was a Bigfoot.  I could not believe what I had heard.  I could not sleep for over an hour, and we laid in bed waiting for more howling but there was none. The next day when I told everyone in the house, nobody had heard it.  Later Sunday morning, I used my cell phone to google different animal sounds to try to find the same howl I heard.  I tried Mountain lion, Wolf, Fisher, Fox, and none of them are in the least bit similar.  Then, I googled Bigfoot howls.  Oh my god! The 1994 Ohio Moaning Howl is almost exactly what I heard.  I got chills when I listened to it.  I played the recording to my household, and my oldest adult son recognized the sound also.  He as well as a few of his friends have had a few experiences too, including a rock being thrown at him. He has the rock in his bedroom.  I phoned my other family members and told them what I experienced and my mom told me that there was a post on facebook about a week earlier from someone that lives a few blocks away from me.  She was returning home late at night near the local dump (between Hoopa and Willow Creek, California).  Apparently, she thought she saw something near the highway and so did the car behind her as the other car turned around and drove back.   This location is only a couple of mountains away from where my home is located.  I figure the Bigfoot traveled to Hoopa from the dump site. I have lived in this area (Weitchpec and Hoopa, CA) almost my entire life and I have never, ever heard such a howl.  I think about the experience daily, but I actually feel fortunate to have witnessed this rare creature howling.

"My name is J. M., and my friend's name is R.S., and we were hiking about a mile above Sand Canyon, near Tehachapi, California, he lost his prescription sunglasses, and we split up to search for them. As I was hiking, I saw a very strange track. It looked human, but it was larger than any human foot print. Also, unless a human was walking a mile from the road barefoot through rough terrain, so it couldn't have been human. I met up with R.S., and on the way back I showed him the print. He is an Army veteran from Iraq and an avid hunter, and he was simply shocked by that footprint. He said to me, ""J. look, you can even see the toe prints! This creature has to be at least 7 feet tall!"" We looked at each other. I asked him, ""How old do you think that print is?""  He answered, ""It looks to be about 3 days old."" We both decided, after finding his sun glasses, we should head back to the car, while keeping a VERY sharp look out for anything strange. After we had reached home, it started to snow. We both realized it was very fortunate that we got to see that, because the snow would have wiped it out.","You take 58 East from Tehachapi and exit on Sand Canyon Road.

"I left my parents house on my way back to NAS Lemoore, Ca. As my buddy and I were heading towards Gorman on 138 (Lancaster Road)between 200th street west and 280th street west, we both saw something to our right running through the desert. It had to have been 7 plus feet tall, thin and long stringy hair hanging off its body. Arms seemed long with a long stride. I didn't believe what I saw, about a minute later my buddy asked if I had seen something, I said yes. He then described exactly what I saw. It was dark and it really spooked us. We took off quick, to this day I know I saw something and it puts a chill down both our spines when we talk about it. Friends and family think I'm crazy, I know what I saw.

"On a day after the snow had fallen, we went hunting up in the Lake Hughes area in California. There were 4 of us hunting that day; my dad, and myself and 2 good buddies. Well, the deer hunting was not that good that day so one of my buddies said to us, my wife's uncle is gone from his cabin and won't be back any time soon, so why don't we visit his land and all and just hang out and all and have some lunch. Well, he lives by Lake Hughes's road and close to where we were. We went over there and unlocked the gate as he had a key. We went in there and we had brought some apples for our lunch and all. We seen he had hogs and started feeding them these apples. After about 1/2 hour of doing this, we heard the horses behind the house or cabin, running around and making all kinds of noise. We could not see what was going on as; the house was in the way. But, man were they going nuts!!!  So, we all said to each other, let's get over there and see what's up. We did and could not see anything but the horses still going nuts and running in circles. We then looked over this fence and threw a gate and seen these huge foot print's and smelled something like a dog that's been wet and rotten egg's mixed. Well, the gate was locked and he went inside the cabin or house and got a key for the gate. We went over to the prints, and I'm 6-5 at that time, and weighed 275 lbs. I have a shoe size of 15 4-E. These tracks were much bigger than my shoe and they were made, with some of them in the snow.  I stepped next to them and could not press down and going that deep! I could go maybe 3/4 - 1 inch down. These prints were 4 inches deep!! They were also, 2 to3 inches longer than my foot and much wider. Then I tried to step that far with my step, and no way could I. Then we followed the tracks until they came to this really steep hill. There this thing went up this hill on 2 legs and stepped high enough that, even my good buddy who was a body builder and in great shape, could not climb. I could not even lift my leg that far, and I was 16 years old and pretty limber. No man could lift there leg that high or step that far! No man!!!  Nowhere did we see bear tracks and even if we did, they don't walk that far on 2 legs. Whatever this was, it walked along this fence and turned and went back into the woods, and then up this very steep hill. It must have looked at the horses and maybe seen us feeding the hogs. I never seen it, but we got scared and left that ranch. I have told this story to a few people, and they look at me like, it could be, but you can tell, they don't think this is real.  But, when you see things like this, you just know something is out there. Nobody could change my mind on this one as, I know what I seen and it was not set up as, nobody knew we were going to his ranch, and the next ranch over, nobody was home there either. So, the only thing that could be is, this was real and not faked. Nowhere did we see any human foot prints by any of these tracks or up that steep hill. I know something is going on up there. N.

"A week ago my family and I went on a vacation to the Double Eagle Resort and Spa in June Lake, California. We stayed at one of the furthest cabins at the resort, which backed up to a forest at the bottom of granite rock formations. These rock formations separated the Inyo National Forest from the town of June Lake. The first night we stayed at the resort, June 30, 2010, my brother, my father and I were watching TV in the front of the cabin and at around 11:30pm we went out on our deck to look out at the amazing view we had. Within five minutes the silence was broken when we heard a howl in the distance, which sounded like it was coming from the granite formations, which over looked the resort. All of us froze. The sound scared us because we had never heard a sound like that before. The vocalization lasted under a minute. We waited for another 10-15 minutes out on the deck to see if whatever made the howl would howl again. But it did not howl again so we went back inside and I took a shower. While I was showering my brother and father continued to watch TV, but this time they opened up all the windows in the cabin to see if they could hear the howling again. When I got out of the shower ten minutes later, my brother and father told me they heard the same sound again when I was in the shower and this time my mother who was in bed with her window open heard the howling too. This time there were three howls, which were all shorter than the first howl we heard on the deck and there was only about 20 seconds in between each howl. My family and I stayed there another night but did not hear any more howls.","The location of the howl was near the Double Eagle Resort and Spa located South of Lee Vining and Mono Lake off HWY 158, which is a two-lane road, which makes a C connecting back to HWY 395.",Mono County,California,Summer,37.79337,-119.118,7/31/10,27966,Class B,74.32,62.37,50.42,0.68,Clear throughout the day.
"9--30-15 we were camping at Virginia Lakes. We had killed a deer and had the carcass out back of camp. during the night about 2 a.m. my son, daughter-in-law and my grandson first heard sounds of rocks or big stones being thrown or dropped. Then they started hearing knocking noises like someone hitting trees with a bat followed by a low growl ending in a high pitched scream. This went on for about 15 min. At this time I was awakened by a a noise. I wasn't sure what it was and I thought a bear was after the deer. I jumped up and my son said something was screaming outside. I ran out with a flash light and could see nothing.  I was looking for a bear or eye shine  I got one single eyeshine about 7 or 8 ft off the ground when I panned back it was gone. I thought maybe a raccoon. But when the family told me what they heard I knew it was not a coon and tried to make them think it was a bear. The next morning when I went to check nothing had been touched but a very large pine tree next to the deer had been pushed nearly completely over. I have been an hunter and outdoors man all my life but have no answer for this. Just thought you would like to know because it happened so recently",Virginia Lakes Rd.,Mono County,California,Fall,38.04679,-119.2654,10/2/15,49896,Class B,51.16,39.94,28.72,0.67,Mostly cloudy in the morning.
"I went to Mono Lake with my father early in the morning to capture some long exposure photos of the sunrise. We arrived at the lake around 6 AM right at golden hour. When we got to the parking lol there was one other car parked in the lot. After grabbing my photography gear (camera bag/tripod) we began walking down the path towards the lake. I was looking off to my right hand side and clearly saw something that was all black and bipedal walking parallel with me about 15 yards away. It ducked behind a small tufa as I was watching it walk. I told my dad that I saw something walking on 2 feet and he said that he saw something moving over in that direction as well. I knew that there was a person in the same area as us since there was a car parked in the lot when we arrived so there was still a possibility that what I saw was a person dressed in all black, although it would be strange for a person to be walking off the path in the area where I saw this thing since we were still away from the lake where all of the points of interest are. My dad and I continued to walk towards the lake to shoot the sunrise. As we approached the lake there was another photographer who had their camera mounted on their tripod and was taking photos. At this point I realized that what I saw walking was not a person since the owner of the car who was parked when we arrived had just been accounted for. I did not think I would ever experience something like this in my lifetime. I wish I would have gone to the area where I saw it and looked for some evidence or footprints but I was too scared to stray off the path since it was able to disappear in the brush / tufas so easily.",Mono Lake,Mono County,California,Summer,37.97761,-119.1291,7/28/20,65849,Class B,83.75,69.885,56.02,0.31,Clear throughout the day.
"It happened a couple nights ago. I was watching a movie in my room when I heard a noise outside. This was about 1 in the morning PST. It sounded like a long blowing horn, so I turned my TV on mute thinking it was a siren. I knew it was not a siren when I heard it again, and I knew it was coming from something alive. I went outside and the noise was so disturbing that I actually felt scared of it. It was more like this cry but in a howl, like it was hurt and moaned in pain by an injury. I have a few dogs, and each of them were very disturbed by it too. They refused to come near the front or back doors. It was like they didn't want to come outside. I assumed it must be a bear or a mountain lion, but the one thing that confused me was I don't think animals like them sound like that. The day after this happened, my friend came to pick me up around 8 at night. We enjoy going to casinos, and there is one about 35 miles from where I live. The sun had just set, and we drove maybe no more than 4 miles down the road when I heard the noise again. I rolled the window down more, and my friend heard it too. It was close to where we were, so we slowed down to get a better hear. The noise stopped, so we started driving again. About no more than ten seconds later we saw what looked like a 10 foot man, covered in hair. This is not a joke, and when the headlights shined on his eyes they glowed. Human eyes don't do that! He was pretty far from our vehicle, and no I didn't see his face. His hair was black maybe dark brown, and yes his eyes glowed by light! The first thing we both thought was bigfoot, but neither of us agreed. I did a little look-up on my computer and found information on bigfoot. The howling, and the sight of that animal could not have been a human, and if it were then he had some massive eyes with big contacts to make them glow like that. I am pretty sure the car behind us saw it too, because they slowed down and stayed behind for about a minute after we drove away. We went about our business to the casino that night after our encounter, and now I am a true believer and have decided to notify you about this.",It's pretty simple to get to.

"About five years ago, in late Spring, I took my kids camping in the Lost Creek Wilderness area. They were 8 and 10 years old at the time. We go there quite a bit because it's far enough away to avoid the Denver crowds that flood local trails and parks but close enough it's not a days drive to get there. I have a spot near Tarryall Reservoir I have camped at several times before. It's a few miles off the main dirt road up a jeep trail and during the week there are usually not many people there. I like it because it's on a ridgeline overlooking a small valley. It’s at the end of the Jeep trail, so on the way up and once I’m there I can easily tell if anyone is in the area or coming up on our camp. We got there on a Thursday morning and I didn’t see anyone on the way nor hear anyone down in the valley below us. I had heard bigfoot stories like everyone else but never thought about it or gave them much credit. I figured it was like alien abductions or something. Weird stories that happened in people's imaginations but not real. I do know it wasn’t on my mind when we arrived. We set up and hung out the entire day around camp. The plan was to stay 3-4 nights. We didn't have a fire because there was a fire ban at the time. That night the kids went to bed as soon as it got dark. I went to bed around 11:30 pm or so. I was lying in my sleeping bag for about 20 minutes messing with my phone to see if I could get coverage and play some games. I could hear coyotes start to howl and bark down in the valley below us, where I believe they had a few dens. In the middle of this coyote chatter and barking I hear, about half a quarter mile in the valley below,  this startlingly sound I have never heard before. I have spent years in the mountains. I have heard just about every animal sound there is. With the exception of coyotes, an occasional owl, ranchers cattle, and very rarely a screaming mountain lion most animals stay quiet at night. I heard two deep “WHOOOOP” WHOOOP” sounds coming from about a quarter mile in the small Valley below. The howling from the coyotes instantly stopped and remained silent. At first I thought maybe it was some drunk campers messing around. I had driven through the valley the day before and had seen no one there. Again I hear another series of loud whooping calls. I am running through my head what animal it could be. A bear? A mountain lion? Some sort of crane or bird? I hear it again. Did some ape escape the zoo or and get loose in the mountains? I start hearing what sounds likes someone beating two large pieces of firewood together. These sounds go on for another good 10-15 minutes. After it was over I stayed awake for several hours waiting for the noises to return. At the time I am thinking some idiots came in late to camp and were screwing around in the woods. The next day I walk down to the area I heard the noises come from, to check to see if anyone was there. Not a soul. I thought maybe whoever was there had packed up early and left. We spent the rest of the day at camp and hiking around. Later that afternoon, before dinner I shot some of the rifles I had brought. Amazingly my kids had slept through the previous nights noises and I didn’t tell them about it. I didn’t want to scare them for no reason. The kids went to bed around 9:30 and I stayed up. I figured I would stay up a bit later to see if the sounds would return. About midnight I decided to turn in and get some sleep. I lay awake in my sleeping bag for quite awhile. I still couldn't sleep. Eventually I started to nod off thinking nothing was going to happen that night and whoever had been messing around the night before was gone. I am guessing it was maybe 30 minutes into a very light sleep later that I was startled awake to the sound of two very deep, and loud “WHOOOOP” “WHOOOOP” sounds. This time the sounds were much louder because the sounds were coming from about 70 yards from our camp near the jeep road below us. I am both half scared and half very pissed. I quickly jump out of the tent. I'm now thinking the jerks from the night before have decided to make this personal and have been stalking our camp and think its funny to wake us up in the middle of the night. I never go out in the woods without a rifle and a good light. (I have run into idiots out in the woods before). I heard the whooping noise a couple more times while I started to walk down the slope of the ridge about 25 yards. I was thinking if these people were armed I didn’t want to engage in gun fight in the middle of my camp. I scanned the tree line with my rifle mounted light looking for movement. Each time changing positions after each scan. As I moved a bit further something off to my right and about 30-40 yards away went crashing through the woods. I know what somebody running through the woods sounds like. Whatever this was, it was very big and very heavy. I am thinking “what the heck, is Shaquille O'neal with them? It was running very fast and covering more ground than an average person could. It was also snapping branches and small trees like they were just grass. I could hear the heavy pounding of its large foot steps. At this point, my heart is pounding in my chest as I high tail it back to the camp. I don’t know if this person is running away or trying to flank me.  I was now debating in my head on what to do. Wake the kids (I have no idea to this day how they slept through this) and break camp and leave knowing they will be scared to death when I do. The down side to that is there will be no one to watch our backs as we pack up and I get them up, we’ll make a lot of noise loading the truck, and the trip out puts us down the jeep trail where I was hearing the noises to begin with. I elect my second option. I find a spot in the trees and shadows where I can observe camp and silhouette anyone approaching against the skyline without silhouetting myself. If anyone comes up the hill I will hit them with the light and confront and engage them if I have to. I figure anyone sneaking around my camp at night doing these things can’t have good intentions. I didn’t sleep the rest of the night. I sat waiting with my back against the tree the entire time. I never told the kids. I made up some excuse why we had to leave early that morning and never explained why I was so exhausted. Though the idea of bigfoot was in the back of my mind that second night, for whatever reason my logical side wanted to explain it off as some assholes playing games in the woods. Over the next week, after we got back home, I couldn't shake both the question of what those noises were and was there a possibility that it was a bigfoot. I didn’t really know what a bigfoot would sound like so I started searching google for “bigfoot sounds” That's when I came across this video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuDRpYLsP5c At point :22 of the video I found the exact noises I heard that night. I have listened to it over a dozen times since. I also did some more research on the area. To my surprise I discovered that not only does the area have many reports of bigfoot sightings and encounters but that it is listed as one of the top 10 places to encounter bigfoot in the United States. I also found out there had been a documentary filmed in the area a few years before and featured in the film was Observatory peak; which I could see from my camp a few miles away. There have been so many sightings in the area that the nearby town of Bailey has since placed bigfoot crossing signs along their small town roads. Now when I go up to that area my mindset is a bit different. I look over my shoulder a bit more and I search the tree lines for anything that might be watching me. We went backpacking on the other side of the mountain last year. It was hard to sleep because I was waiting to hear those whoops again. I don't know what it was for sure that night but I don't think it was human. I will be back up there this June. We will see what happens.

"I was elk hunting alone and was having a hard time going to sleep so I was just laying in my bag at about 10:30 pm. Initially I heard what sounded like something clearing its throat but it was a very deep sound that was like nothing I've ever heard. 20 minutes later I heard what sounded like a rock land close to my tent and a few seconds later I heard another one land with a thud, neither sounded as if they rolled as the ground was damp from snow melt. Just after 11 pm I heard something come from the tree line behind me ""wooooo"" ""wooooo"" from two separate locations as if there were several and they were talking to each other.

Oh my God is all that we can say. It is Thursday 08/23/18 and we are just getting to our vehicle from a harrowing hike. We were hiking the road at Kenosha Pass on the east side that takes you to the twin cones above tree line. We began our hike at noon and hiked up the road. We reached the twin cone tree line area at 3:30pm. It was a beautiful and uneventful hike until we were headed back down the road. My daughter had said she thought that she had heard a tree knock and I was being silly and took a rock and knocked on a large rock off of the road and then tossed the rock about 5 ft off of the road. Literally 2 minutes later we both heard multiple loud tree knocking and rocks were whizzing past our heads. The stench was unbearable-like nothing I have ever smelled before. My 21yr.old daughter began to scream and cry as we were under attack by someone or something. I was so startled that I just stood there frozen as this dark figure was staring back at me. I couldn’t move. My daughter grabbed my arm and we took off. I had an air horn that I depressed 3 times as we were running away and that seemed to deter the rock throwing. The rock throwing continued for 5 more minutes as we ran down the hill. We were almost to our vehicle which was parked off the dirt road when we heard a loud guttural whoop off the road abit and we just kept running to the car so very very afraid! We made it back to our vehicle at 6:15pm. I will never return and we are not okay with this.

"My husband and I were camping in the Eagle Nest Wilderness CO early June 2013.  While hiking on the trail we had encountered a larger then normal amount of snow due to the late snow storms.  We were a few miles up the trail from Surprise Lake when we heard a low growl.  We thought this must be a mountain lion and due to the snow and inability to travel quickly we double backed to surprise lake and set up camp for the night.  While sitting at the lakeside I saw a large, brownish red animal across the lake.  The animal was large and appeared to be walking upright.  My rational mind said its just a deer or another large animal that lives in the wilderness and disregarded what I thought I saw.  Later that evening around dusk my husband and I were sitting in the tent when we heard what sounded like a knock against a tree.  We looked out the tent door and didn't see anything.  Again I assumed this must have been a woodpecker, another animal, or a hiker.  We continued talking and heard the knock again, it was a three knock pattern, along with something that sounded like a rock against a tree.  We got out of the tent and looked around.  I told my husband it sounded like a rock thrown against a tree and said let me show you what it sounds like.  I picked up a hard sound rock and threw it against the tree.  Immediately a similar sound came back.  I assumed it was an echo and I did it again.  Again a similar sound came back.  My husband then asked if I saw something moving up the hillside and explained where he saw movement.  A large, brownish red animal was peeking out from behind the tree.  The animal was swaying back and forth from behind the tree.  The animal appeared to be squatted down swaying/peeking out from behind the tree.  It had a large head with a large brow line, large shoulder, and nose.  The nose and upper lip appeared to be a lighter color than rest of the animal seen.  We took our sport camera and tried to take pictures of the animal but it was about 40 feet up a hillside.  (We have a blurry picture but it appears to have a large animal head in the picture.)    As we watched the animal sway back and forth we heard a large knock behind us to the left, towards the lake, then heard a knock up towards the animal we saw then back behind us.  The feeling was very odd and made us feel very uncomfortable.  My husband wanted to hike out but due to the late evening I suggested we stay and hike out first thing in the morning.  We carry a large knife, bear spray, and a gun with us so I felt somewhat safe.  It was a very restless night and first daylight we packed our bags and left.  After hiking out and getting in the car to drive off we discussed what we witnessed and both could not explain what we saw.  This has taught me not to throw rocks against trees! I would be willing to send the pictures we took.  Two are extremely blurry due to my hand shaking, my husband took two other pictures, one you can see the head if you zoom up and the other it appears it moved.",Campsite at Surprise Lake in the Eagle Nest Wilderness.

"On Thursday July 25 my girlfriend and I we hiking in Mayflower Basin south of Co 91. We were up in the basin and Helen had gone ahead to the foot of the basin. I was about 100 yds off the three miner log cabin remnants sitting on a rock enjoying peanuts and water when, looking west, I saw a very large brown biped approach the snow wall / cornice and seek to climb it. The biped was unable to climb up over 20 feet, moved back down laterally to its right, and then down to the ground off the snow. It then walked on two legs very briskly to the right, subsequently out of my view. About 4-5 minutes later a hiker with his dog came walking down the trail. And I later saw this brown biped from time to time walking above the snow cornice southbound. Did not see it again. Helen returned to me, we discussed, then walked down to the locked gated prohibiting cars into the basin to talk with the hiker. His name was Robbie, his dog, Dallas. We agreed to scale up the trail to where I had seen the brown biped. Helen took longer, but Robbie and I reached the area, found hand prints in the snow in an arch, one print lower with three big fingers and one thumb. Foot prints were not descriptive of toes, arch heel.  We took Iphone photos and will share if interested. We then traversed to right, north, on difficult terrain. That is quite slanted where the biped moved quickly and easily. No further sighting. This was now about 2:30 pm when Inhad seen the biped about 1:45 pm.

"My wife and I took a drive to Skaguay reservoir near Victor Colorado. Nice day and there were people fishing along the lake. Crazy thing is it was 11am and this thing walked across a valley in full sight of lots of people. It was across the lake maybe half a mile, walking slow but was moving at a fast pace, its arm movements and stride looked normal to be going that fast. I asked my wife her thought and she said it looked big and moved real differently. There were people on the lake and on the far bank half way to the animal fishing, it appeared larger at a greater distance. When it left the valley it left a way or on a trail that no one would choose.

"Three of us went on a deer hunt that morning. We had a hunter at the top of the hill and he went up there in the dark before sunrise. At dawn my uncle and I went up the hill together parting ways half way up. There were two other hunters not in our party camped by us about 200 yards away at the base of the mountain. We did not know them or their plans. Anyway halfway up the mountain my uncle went to the right (SE) and I went left (NW). The southside of the mountain (which I was on) was open with sage brush and scattered cypress trees. In the gulches of the face, were thick timber groves of mainly large pine trees, clustered, only to be seperated by the openess I just described.My plan was to stay in the tree groves working my way to the peak driving the deer to the top of the hill where the other hunter was positioned. I worked the grove until it ended forcing me to cross a clearing to the left to enter the grove located under the peak. When I got to the right vertical edge of the treeline to the grove, I found the first blind. It was made of a broken branch that was placed up side down and leaning against a tree. The branch was interwoven into the branches of the larger tree. At this time I had a feeling I was being watched and assumed it was the other two hunters that weren't in our party that were camped a couple hundred yards from us at the base of the mountain. I continued left into the grove and found a 25 foot tree placed upside down next to another tree well over 50 feet high. The base was about 18"" and had been snapped not sawed. Some branches had interwoven into this tree just like the little blind I first discovered on the groves edge. I'd guess the elevation was 8,500 feet, as the top of the hill was 10,000 and our camp was at the base of about 7,000. I now had an increasingly strong feeling of being watched again at this point. As I left the second blind/upsidown tree working my way up and to the left I saw the silhouette of a bipedal primate about 8 feet tall standing still looking at me. It was perpendicular to me, faced up hill in almost a runners stance, and looking over its right shoulder, at me, slightly with its wide muscular torso turned to me. It's brow was extremly pronounced, its forehead was small with the back of it's head slightly pointed. His head (assuming a male as it did not have breasts,) was proportionatly small in relation to it's body. It's arms were extremly long, hairy, lean yet muscular, It's hands had very long palms and long fingers that curled back with a thumb that curled forward forming a backward capital ""C"" type shape. It then sprinted up the hill and vanished behind the trees faster than a deer bolts into a dead run from a standstill. It was on the left edge of the grove with a clearing behind it. This all happened in a second or two. I went to the place I saw it (60 yards) and found no footprints as the ground had at least a foot of pine needles that cushioned footprints and would spring back up when you walked. I used a tree that was close by gauge it's height. It was of dark color but not sure if dark brown or black as it was shady in the grove with sunlight behind it in the clearing. I was in a state of kind of shock and almost not believing what I saw but knowing I did and simply just amazed. Because of this when I got home, later that week I decided to consult a hypnotist. I had never seen one but figured since they help witnesses recall a crime and descriptions of accounts that happen quickly or under stress it would probably help me confirm what I saw. The hypnosis confirmed my sighting.

"New to the area in July 2005, I had been traveling from Crescent City, CA over the Pass (Hwy 199) weekly to Grants Pass and back and now in the Winter of 2006, it was 2X weekly.  My wife had not joined me and we were separated and I was attending counseling classes in Medford, OR. We had 5 children and I had my son living with me and he was back at home.  He was about 13. This particular night I was delayed on my return from Medford in the evening (usually arriving back in Crescent City around 1215 AM).  It is roughly an hour from the Tunnel to arrive in either Crescent City or Brookings, OR where I live now. I had stopped @ the Bug Station and rested (because I was delayed in my return) sitting with the heater on and engine idling and doors locked.  The little phone booth shack for Inspections there now, was not there yet.  After closing my eyes about 40 minutes, I'm guessing like 1225 AM, I was rested and awake to get going again back to Crescent City. I use my High Beams because it is so dark through there and everyone does because it is like signaling any opposing traffic of your whereabouts (everyone is usually polite to lower them upon the distance closing). I left the Tunnel and traveled down the hill and began the series of 'S' turns through the Pass (it's like a Canyon and runs adjacent to various sections of the Smith River). I was slowing through the 2nd 'S' turn and was watching my headlights and the shadows of the Roadside barriers as they were casting the shadows in the trees along the river. My truck was an older Chevy Dually with a small diesel and it was not a Powerhouse like the newer ones.  I was just cruising with the turns and taking my time.  It had a shell with an 8 foot bed and it was used by a retired couple to tow their trailer so it is kind of slow. The lights are low to the ground and when the high beams are on the go out further and up higher.  You can be seen by anyone else and they can see you from a ways off. As I rounded the turn and was approaching the end of the turn while watching my high beam shadows of the barricade up in the trees, I noticed this BIG Dark Shadow cast in the trees from my lights as I rolled along and my lights lit up a Giant Creature walking along the opposite side, going against traffic- facing away from me.  I said to myself, ""Oh shit!"" and was very excited.  The next part of the turn was coming up right away and I immediately thought to turn around to see it's face.  I knew it was Bigfoot (Sasquatch) and wanted to see his face but, I was too close still to maneuver around and go the other way and the turn was too shallow.  A thousand things went through my mind, ""what does he look like, don't turn around yet, what if he's hostile, he'll beat up my truck, don't turn around here...."" The logging trucks fly through there and my slow diesel would have to do a 3 point turn around or more and possibly get T-boned.  I was excited but, also a bit scared.  This was amazing. I kept telling myself ""Not yet.  Don't turn around here."" I kept looking for spots along the rode to turn around , even a little room, because I really wanted to see it's face.  The mix of it being late, a tight turning canyon, being afraid and also excited - I was bewildered a little..., ""What do I do?"" Almost immediately it was now the small FAST 'S' turns (very narrow) that lead to the Narrow passage (it is extremely tight through there and you can see the Tree hanging off the cliff above the roadway in the daytime..., and, this leads to the Resort @ Patricks Creek Lodge). As I passed I was still shaken up and thought what do you do, no one will believe me. As I passed Little Jones Creek I decided to forget about turning around because 1. I had really seen it 2. It was late and no one would believe me anyhow (I did not have a  regular cell phone- it was a cheap Android and off due to no reception- a real long Start-up time when turned on). So, heres what I saw and why I am documenting it. It was over 8' Tall..., I am 6'2"" and played Basketball since 4th grade even against 7' players in high school (I was a Leaper and could jump really high- I was 6' when I was 12- stopping my growth @ 15 years old @ 6'2"").  I could not accurately guess the weight but well over 4-500 pounds- possibly 600, 700 or even 800. He had no neck with a Pointed-type head buried between his MASSIVE shoulders..., Huge Shoulders.  I was going slow enough through the turn to see his fingers, toes and palms and foot bottoms as he walked but his hair was like a Llama- matted looking but long and, longer and shorter on different parts of his body.  He was Light Grey to Smokey Charcoal Grey with some Black deeper in beneath his hair closer to his body. The hair was long on his calves, forearms, hands and feet so I just saw tips of long fingers.  His feet bottoms were flipping TOUGH (I'll spell it TUFF) because they were Wide and what I would describe as Padded.  He walked swinging his harms down near his knees but above them and up right, not hunched over like an ape..., he was walking but just massive- those Shoulders.  I saw him a good 3 - 4 seconds. His Torso was Longer in proportion to his legs, his leg length of Thigh to Calves was not as long as his upper body- he was Huge. I went to work the next day and told a co-worker who had lived up here for over 20 years and an avid hunter and fisherman and he is also part Cherokee so , I know I could trust him.  He has spent countless hours Elk hunting, and bear hunting. He looked at me kind of silly and sluffed it off so I just shut up..., ""You've only been up here about 8 months and you've already seen Bigfoot?"" I know what I saw. After learning more and now hearing the term Gigantopithecus I looked it up and the Tropical is the one I saw.  Turn the animal around and that is exactly what was 'walking' down the roadway. Here's a link to the picture that convinced me to tell my experience: http://knobbythebigfoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/gigantopithecus_human.jpg I'm going to start looking for him soon.

"I live in the ""Bay Area"" of California. My visual sighting is at the bottom of this report. I have photos of that I want to send. I enjoy hiking and camping on a regular basis year round. I have been considering submitting a report for my encounter over the last few months and finally I am doing it. My encounter happened about 4 months ago in July. My girlfriend and I were ""dispersed camping"" (which is where campers can legally set up a tent in the national forest for free for up to 14 days) in El Dorado National Forest off of Hwy 50, about 6 miles east of Bridal Veil Falls. We have a secluded spot we always return to on the bank of a 10-15 foot wide, 4-5 feet deep (at the deepest) river. Some time in the night, probably 1-4 AM, my girlfriend woke me up saying she heard someone jumping into the river about 50 feet away, and it sounded like the person's legs were sloshing against the water the way it would sound if you were walking fast through thigh-deep water. Sure enough, a few seconds after she whispered this to me, I heard the noise too. She was accurate in her description of the sound. I guess my protective instincts kicked in because without hesitation I unzipped the tent with my large mag-light in hand, (the type police officers use) and stood outside my tent, spotlighting the river bank and the forest around us. I saw nothing, so I called out that there were people and please go the other way, still heard nothing. After that we didn't hear any more unusual sounds. What struck me as odd was, why would anyone be walking in FREEZING cold (likely glacier run-off) water in the dark morning hours, not anywhere near any trails, and not anywhere near any roads...? (We had to hike to this spot and it's a mile from our car, down a very steep heavily forested hillside full of underbrush, which is why this spot was so hard to find and it was an accidental find, and why it stays secluded.) It had me pondering for the last few months and even brought me to considering maybe it was a bigfoot because it sounded like two legs, not the way a bear would sound trudging through the water. Plus, there was nothing in the river I could see so whoever or whatever would've had to be farther than we thought and therefor very large to make sound seem so close... The next morning we went for a long hike as it was our last day camping. We had just gotten back to the car when I looked back at the treeline we had just came out of a, sort of, for a last glance, I will miss you, type of look, and I saw what I first thought was a black bear in the very top (the literal tip) of a 60-70 foot pine tree, it was staying still but I could see it was wiggling a little, almost like it was positioning itself comfortably, and it looked like it was hugging the tree like a bear. But then I saw the second ""bear"" in the SAME spot as this one in a tree right next to it. At this point I'm about 500 feet from these things and the trees they were in. I was able to take many photos of these ""bears"" and I have them on my phone and will send them to anyone who wants to see. On closer inspection, these were not bears. I showed a few friends and family and they all see what I see, it appears there is a UNIFORM Jet Black sillouette of a large, lean human man. When you see these pictures you will get an off/odd feeling. I know they weren't bears and I know they weren't humans. I'm not sure what they were, but I know what they were not. After viewing them for about a minute my girlfriend began to get a bit worried they might come down, so we left. And we didn't talk about it much as she isn't interested in the subject.

"I want to share an experience my family and I had near Lake City, CO on June 12, 2021. We have visited Lake City for several years in a row, spending a week there each summer. One of our favorite places is Deer Lakes, about 15 miles southeast of Lake City off Hwy 149. We always spend several evenings out there fishing, cooking out, watching wildlife. Also found in that area are two ponds known as the Upper Mill Pond, nearest Hwy 149, and the Lower Mill Pond another mile or two down the road. On our way to Deer Lakes this visit, we stopped at the Upper Mill Pond to fish, but we saw a cow moose and two calves just below the pond eating in the runoff creek. (We almost always see moose near Deer Lakes) While we were watching the moose from the cab of our truck, we heard the undisputable sound of a wood knock. At first, none of us thought much about it, until we heard another one. I was in the driver seat, furthest away from the pond and moose. My daughter was in the backseat on the driver's side while my wife was in the front passenger seat nearest the pond and moose. The girls thought the sound came from the direction of the pond but I thought it came from the other direction. The pond, and road to Deer Lakes, sits in a valley between two ridges. The tree line on the east, or pond side, is only about a hundred yards away from the road while the tree line to the west, or opposite the pond, varies, in some places a few hundred yards from the road and other places not far off at all. My daughter and I got out of the cab of the truck to listen after we all heard the second knock. Then she and I both believed the sounds were coming from the west tree line. We waited, listening, and heard another knock, this time seemingly from a different position from the first two knocks. In a bit, another vehicle stopped to watch the moose. When they arrived, we heard another knock. A third vehicle drove past and we heard still another knock as it went by. In all,  we heard what I would guess to be 8-10 knocks, from at least three different positions, but all on the west side of the road. My family and I talked about it. It was possible that there were a few guys in the woods making the sounds. Maybe one guy knocked on a tree, then another heard it and knocked back. That's possible. However, what sealed it as a bigfoot for me happened later that night. After we heard the knocks by the Upper Mill Pond while watching the moose, we went on to Deer Lakes where we planned to fish, but our lines were too tangled. We did get to cook out though. As the sun went down, we left Deer Lakes but drove further away from the highway, waiting until it got very dark before we went back to town so we could se the stars really well. Just off Hwy 149 on the road to Deer Lakes is a staging area for people to park trailers to unload their ATVs. There is also a forest department bathroom there. That is where we parked to stargaze. As soon as we got out of the truck and shut the doors, we heard a knock from the east ridge of mountains. This tree line is several hundred yards from the road. It was not yet pitch dark. We could still make out the silhouette of the mountain against the backdrop of the sky, but it was too dark to make out any individual trees. I can't imagine any reason any person would be up on that ridge, at that time of night, in the dark, in the cold, just waiting for the possible chance that someone would stop at that staging area and get out of their vehicle so they could hoax them with a wood knock. I believed, for sure, at that time that bigfoot were in the area. In full disclosure, I am a bigfoot enthusiast. I watch all the tv shows, I watch videos on youtube, I have been a member of forums. But I live near Amarillo, TX where it is flat, dry farmland. There is no bigfoot hunting around here. I do always keep my eyes open when we visit the mountains or wooded areas, but this is my first experience of anything that I would contribute in any way to bigfoot. On a related note, a few years ago on an earlier trip to Lake City and Deer Lakes, my family and I were getting ready to leave Deer Lakes. I had to visit the men's room before we drove back to town, so my wife and daughter were walking up the path from the lakes to the parking lot. They heard what they described as an incredible crash, very loud and sudden. An adult male moose was in the upper lake eating when the crash occurred. This moose was frightened so much that he raced out of the water and into the woods, scaring my family terribly. When I came out of the restroom they were at the truck and asked me if I heard the crash. I had not heard anything somehow. They told me what happened and I instantly thought of bigfoot pushing over a tree in the woods up from the lake. There was no way for us to know for sure. The girls certainly didn't want to go into the woods to investigate. So we could possibly have had two bigfoot encounters at or near Deer Lakes. I am almost positive we heard them knocking on June 12, 2021. Thanks for your time. Sorry for rambling on so long about something probably insignificant to most people. But it was my first encounter and I was pretty excited about it. Let me know if you have any follow up questions.

"A friend and I had just started heading home from a day trip in the conifer area of Colorado. As we drove down a stretch of road with approx 1/2 miles visibility, we ""both"" saw a creature run from one side of the highway to the other. This creature was tall considering we had been about 4-500 hundred feet away in the car. It effortlessly took a few long strides and cleared the entire width of the road. It was clearly upright on two feet, which at that point both of us looked at each other wide eyed, like we couldn't really register what we've just saw. Once we pulled off to the spot that it had crossed, we both took notice that there was about 5-6 mule deer that seemed to be completely undisturbed or spooked. We both realized that if this was a human, these deer would not have been anywhere close to the commotion. This was my very first and only sighting and I'm absolutely positive what we saw was authentic. The mix of weather and the time of day reduced the hiker and tourist traffic that day, so the thought of someone playing games isn't a viable conclusion to me. My friend is also convinced, since he was raised in New Hampshire and has had similar experiences. Since that day, I've been hooked! My friend and I are extreme outdoorsmen with many years of survival training, so we will be spending a lot more time in the area of our sighting soon.

"My girlfriend and I were on a short hike 2 weeks ago in Staunton State Park, in between Bailey and Conifer, CO.  We chose a route which would have less people, as I'd hiked the other routes in the park previously.  After hiking uphill along a stream for about an hour, we saw a rocky outcropping and hiked off-trail briefly to check out the view. It was very quiet out with little wind movement.  There were no clouds in the sky and the temperature was in the mid-50s. Time of day was approximately noon MST. We sat in the sun on the outcropping for about 10 minutes very quietly, enjoying the view and the weather.  We looked down below the cliff and noticed a gentleman riding a mountain bike quickly up the path with headphones in.  As we watched, we heard a very low growl which sounded like a startled exhalation - ""Grrrrrrphhhh,"" followed immediately by a very different, higher-pitched ""Whoooooooop.""  The mountain biker seemed to hear nothing, as the headphones must have been too loud.  The two noises came from the same direction, approximately 30-40 yards below us on the outcropping through thick forest.  We were unable to see any animals, but the sounds were very clear and definitely came from the same animal.  The animal definitely sounded startled by the fast-moving biker. My girlfriend's eyes got very wide, and she whispered to me that she had no idea what kind of animal made that noise.  I responded that she'd say I'm crazy, but that only primates make the ""whoop"" noise.  We climbed down from the outcropping a few minutes later and searched for whatever made the noise, but were unable to find anything, nor heard any more sounds.  We definitely did not feel threatened in any way.",Staunton State Park,Jefferson County,Colorado,Fall,39.52701,-105.4147,10/11/14,46805,Class A,57.62,47.89,38.16,0.62,Foggy in the morning.
"Visual Incident: I was spending the evening at a 2 bedroom cabin at the YMCA in Estes Park. It had been a cold, snowy day, and I had gone to bed rather early (around 8 pm.). I awakened at 2:30 and got up to look out the bedroom window, through the curtains, just to check on the weather, see if stars were out, etc. I noticed that the basement lights were still on in the rather large, two-story 3-bedroom family cabin. This cabin was about 75 yards directly SE of my cabin (in back of me). I assumed the lights were still on since children may have been playing games that night, and simply forgot to turn out the lights. I looked out the window of about a half minute with this thought on my mind. I didn't see any movement inside the cabin basement, so I assumed the family had retired for the evening. Just as I was about to close the curtain, I saw a very tall, rather large, dark figure stride past the entirely of the basement, across the snow. The stride of this figure was very deliberate and determined. It did not waiver. It did not rush. The figure had long legs, and was mostly all legs. Its torso was solid and straight. It did not look human, I did not discern any clothing on it. I was puzzled at first, thinking, ""Who in their right mind would be outside in this weather, walking in the deep snow (about 1/2 foot or so deep) outside past the lighted basement of this cabin? The figure emerged from the right side of the cabin and was heading to the left side, which would have been toward the direction of the road and the next set of cabins (about 50 or more yards away). There were no other lights on at the time, but the snow held its own illumination in the dark. The basement back-lighting created the perfect silhouette for the striding figure. I only saw it swing its arms, it was not carrying anything. After I watched it pass, I closed the curtain (this episode lasted about 20-30 seconds) and then it occurred to me it had resembled images of what I have been informed about regarding sightings of Bigfoot. i did not have Bigfoot on my mind AT ALL prior to this incident. The image remained in my mind for a good while, so I got up and checked all the locks on the doors, just to feel more safe, since I was staying alone in the cabin. Auditory (Vocalization episode) The next day was especially snowy, almost like a white out. The snow was VERY thick and it was easy to get stuck, as the YMCA plows were working as hard and fast as they could to clear the narrow roads throughout the campus. It was very difficult to pass safely down some of the roads. I had just come out of the Mootz Crafts Center, and had gotten my car stuck. I was fortunate that some kind male guests spotted me getting stuck and helped to push my car out of a snow bank. They left quickly and went back inside the lodge nearby. The snow was falling quickly and heavily, and I was beginning to worry I might get stuck again. I was standing outside my car, trying to determine the best driving route to take, when all of a sudden from the back of the woods, nearby what I would determine was the Livery Stables, came a very loudly projected guttural (like from the deep part of the back of a throat) type of cry-moan. It lasted several seconds (about 4 seconds or so). I looked around to see if I could see anyone, but no one was out at all. The weather was far too severe. I stood by my car, opened the car-door, which made a squeak, and the sound uttered once again, almost exactly as it had the first time. Same loudly projected quality, carrying from somewhere back deep in the nearby woods. This time, I felt intimated and frightened. This sound did not match the sound of an elk, or a mountain lion or a person, or a kid being silly. ""The bears are all asleep,"" I thought. The message that I perceived from it was ""I am here. I can see you. This is my territory."" I quickly got into my car, closed the door and managed to pull away out of the deep snow, leaving the YMCA campus. it was a very eerie experience,and I can still feel the chill going up my spine as I think of the impact of those howls on that very snowy day.",Both incidents occurred on the YMCA Campus located in Estes Park.,Larimer County,Colorado,Winter,40.33838,-105.5728,2/9/14,44401,Class B,25.4,20.355,15.31,0.34,Foggy until afternoon.

"My husband and I went to check on a friend's cabin on Storm Mountain north of Drake, CO. While behind the cabin we thought we heard voices like a small kid hollering I so went to see.  We were in the national forest behind the cabin. I went on ahead of  my husband. He has a bad back and doesn't walk far. We had walkie talkies. I went on ahead where the sound was coming from. I was talking to my husband on the walkie talkie. When I went up the hill in the wooded area  I could hear limbs cracking like someone walking nearby. I saw a rock outcropping area. I felt like I got zapped by infra-sound. I took a picture in that direction of the noise and child like sounds. My phone went dead but my w.t. I had my was still working.

"On Saturday afternoon on August 4, 2018 at approximately 2pm my boyfriend and I were driving from Berlin to Woodbridge about halfway there I was staring out the passenger side window as my boyfriend was driving. In a clearing of the woods I saw what looked to be an extremely tall man with shoulder length dirty blonde hair. As I focused in I realized this 8 ft tall creature’s arms, chest and legs were also covered in the same long dirty blonde hair. He was walking north with the back of his hands facing forward, swaying like a gorilla as he walked on two legs. As we passed him I jumped out of my seat and turned around and kept my eyes locked on him as long as I could. My boyfriend asked me why I did that and I told him, “I think just saw a Sasquatch.

"I was driving south down from the mountain on my regular route I had my high beams on because its dark in that area. Its very rural when all of sudden a large up right dark figure stepped out into the road I stopped and watch it cross the road in three steps.

"Hey guys and Lady, My name is xxx and I have never seen a Bigfoot or Sasquatch. I do however believe that something could be out there. May 23rd (2013) at around 11:30 pm I was on my way to the Orlando Airport to pick up my son-in-law. I was on the Beach Line or 528 toll road. I had slowed down due to his flight being delayed and it had been raining when I saw something moving from the side of the road toward the fence and pasture land.  It is not unusual to see deer, wild turkeys and from time to time hogs even on this busy road, however this was none of the above. What I saw was very large, hunched over, and moving quickly toward  the wire fence and was a greyish color and the hair was longer, so it was not a loose cow or large hog. I was close enough to see the size and it was big, I cannot tell you how tall it was only a guess.

"Aug. 26 2011 This day was a Friday in August, Central Florida. In the pre-dawn hours of the morning my husband was not even half way on his commute from Space Coast to Disney World to report for his early morning shift, like he does 5 days a week.  He takes the 192 which involves a loooong stretch of road with seemingly no sign of life anywhere for about an hour until you reach the St. Cloud area.  My husband slammed on the brakes to try to avoid what was in the road without hitting it dead on, all the while trying to avoid flipping his Volkswagon Passat. Unfortunately, he could not avoid contact, and he struck the massive 9 Ft. Gator. He pulled the car over after attempting to resume driving, realizing the car was now undriveble. He made phone calls to the insurance company, his job, and me. I head out on the same stretch of 192 to retrieve him.  His vehicle is being loaded onto a flatbed and he is waiting with the tow truck driver who is nice enough not to leave him standing at the side of the road in the middle of nowhere at (now) 6 o'clock in the morning. I am driving, wide awake, looking the whole time for this piece of road kill.  I want a photo of it. No I am not morbid, but he said it was HUGE, and I take pictures of all wild animals I come across. Bunnies, snakes, gators, whatever.  I drive a long time, the sun is breaking over the line at the moment I finally come to the Gator.   It is daylight enough that I can drive without headlights and I can see outside very well. I see it up ahead in the distance, I see the Turkey Vultures. The BIG BLACK birds that come to eat the road kill.  My eyes are darting down to the road, up ahead the highway looking for the tow truck, back to the monstrous mess in the road.  I am slowing down so I can photograph the Gator, and I am reaching for my camera.  As my eyes follow a 3-pack of the large birds up off the road and cross over the the right, I see a man walk into the woods up ahead. He is up ahead a distance I would call a block. A block away.  He is wearing ALL BLACK.  His elbows are bent as he is walking,  and he disappears into the woods. So I am pulling over now, snapping photos of the disgusting mound that is so large in the road that if it's not cleaned up, and if someone hits that, there is going to be another accident. And I am fully awake and present in the moment.  I am running a checklist in my head.  Gator. Birds. Man. Man ?!?!  What Man? Why would a ""man"" be out here at (now) 7am exactly, walking around in the woods. There are cows here.  Lots of land you pass on this road has cattle being  raised for beef. Oh, and a DEER sign. A sign, just a moment back I passed , warning of Deer Crossing. (Thanks for the heads up on the 9 Ft. Gators).  So he's tending to his cows?  A ranch hand? Where's his truck? Where's his Cowboy hat? . So I recall this again.  A man - in ALL black- no change of color for face or hands- Wearing a black hoodie? On a beautiful, warm, dry, summer morning- in August- in Central Florida? He's not  looking  when  a car pulls up? He  walks into the woods that are headed nowhere?  I don't think so.  Makes no sense.  I think I saw a Bigfoot. So it took me about 2 minutes to put this all together and I didn't want to leave!  I wanted to go in after him.  I couldn't. My husband was waiting and was all revved up from his climactic morning.  He would be angry if I delayed, goofing off. The tow truck driver had waited long enough. I snapped like 2 pictures of the mess in the road and quickly moved on. Putting this all together in the months since the event, it makes more and more sense that what I saw was a Florida Skunk Ape.  Of course he would be pulled out of the woods at the knowing of the HUGE road kill.  It was dark for more than an hour while that Gator sat there in the dark. There was time for a Bigfoot to hoof it on out there and check out the scene, hey, he even had enough time to pack a bag lunch. Nearly escaping unnoticed before the sun came up over the horizon. It has been almost a year, and I am planning to go back to said location and search for prints and evidence one day. I have driven by the exact location approximately 6 times since then. Each time going over and over it in my head.  I am so angry with myself that I had camera in hand, and came up empty.  But even driving in the passenger side with the camera hanging out of the window I can miss a pic of a deer!  Nothing could have prepared me to photograph a ""hey--maybe that's a ""somethin'  "" at a moment's notice.  Meanwhile, since my incident I have heard of two other sightings in locations that are within 2 hours driving distance (east or south) of my incident.  I continue to search for new reports of local sightings and hope to make future trips to search for tracks.

"Around 2 or 3 am I was woken by a sound that I can only describe as a mixture of a whooping, screaming, howl. I have heard coyotes and bobcats and this was not anything like that.

"Well where do I start. Oddly enough, here, at my last resort. Let me please start off with the whole I'm not crazy speech. I live here in Central Florida and work as a Deputy Sheriff for the past 16 years. Add to that my time in the military and being some what of a hunter and one could say I have spent a good bit of time in the woods and around the world. However about 1.5 years ago myself and a friend (with a similar background) heard something while hog hunting at night that to this day rattled my very being. The location was near Lake Hatchineha in the Poinciana area of Polk County. The time was close to 2am. We were still hunting in an open area with a heavy woodline between us and the lake. What we both heard is difficult to describe since I had only ever heard a similar sound in a movie. Yep a movie, and excluding that in my four decades of life and travel I have never heard anything remotely close. It was not a whoop or a howl or a cry but what I can only describe as a chuffing noise. Now if you want to listen to the only thing that I have been able to find that comes close, watch Jurassic Park and when the raptors call to each other, that's it. But here is where that similarity ends. The sound was much deeper and had a slight rumble at the end. From our position it sounded at least 1/4 -1/2 mile away. The noise was made four times like (chuff-chuff-chuff-chuff)  then complete silence and by that I mean not even the birds were chirping.  Both my buddy and I had that whole hair on the back of the neck thing going on big time. What set our nerves on overdrive was after about  an hour later we heard it again. This time it was to our north and only about 50 yards away. Needless to say it was much louder as in I honestly felt it in my chest. What ever it was it was big and moving our way in the tree line. We could hear it moving slowly to the west and it did not sound like a deer, bear, or any of the many other animals I have heard or tracked ever. I will say this. I do not scare easily. I have been alone in deep woods in the green swamp and never had a second thought. But that night I have not and will not ever forget. We hunted the rest of the night back to back literally. Now I assume your wondering why am I writing this here. Well in truth I have searched every site on strange noises with no luck. I have spoken to countless others about it with no luck and got in touch with my buddies at FWC with no luck. Am I a believer? Well my thought is simple - why cant they exist? Did we hear one that night? I have no clue. I am making contact with you because as I stated earlier this seems like my last resort. Maybe you or someone has heard the same thing and can identify the animal. If you actually have or just need to Q&A me I can be contacted by email or phone Thank you for your time.","Location was and undeveloped area north of Rock Drive.

"While bicycling on the Van Fleet trail on the North End, I saw 2 ""humans"" cross the trail about 200 yards ahead of me. They were both dark brown color from head to toe. The 1st was tall and quite big, well over 6 feet. The second was smaller and much lighter. Long arms and large head. They walked onto the tar trail, paused briefly to look at me coming, then ran off the trail. When I got to the spot they crossed, there was no trail to hike or run on and a very steep bank on the side they left on. It didn't take long to get to the spot, but they had completely gone out of sight. This trail goes through the Green Swamp, so there is not much around the area except swamp.

"May 16, 2013: I live on the border of Highland City and Bartow. Our neighborhood borders a series of orange, grapefruit and tangerine groves that are all adjacent to landfill and mining property.  Around 7:30 pm my daughter asked, as she does typically, ""dad, lets go look at the pigs"". About three to four times a week we ride these groves on our four wheeler and survey for wild animals. We've seen bobcat, coyote and pigs. In the past two and a half months we have been following a family of pigs which when we first sighted them had around 15 piglets about a month old. So we have been spotting them to see the growth of the piglets who are about 40 lbs now. After making our normal rounds around a few sections of groves we had not spotted the family. After riding slot down one of the main grove roads she spotted a big boar and we kept moving. The four wheeler was giving us some problems so I ran up through the gears to maybe clean the carb a little which put us about a quarter of a mile down this main road further back into the groves. We then turned around and returned to the spot where she had seen the big boar, well a few rows of trees short, where we slowed our pace to view this pig. Sure enough he was there. Three rows of trees past this location was the intersection of another heavily traveled grove road where we slowed down and turned the four wheeler off to listen for any more pigs. Just after shutting the four wheeler off a smaller boar crossed the adjacent main road....and then another, another and another. Three boars crossed. Immediately after seeing the boars, in the opposite direction we both heard four simultaneous noises. Now I consider myself an avid outdoorsman, hunting small and large game and also fishing for the last 25 years. I've seen and heard just about every animal in the local ecosystem and still hunt alligators yearly. After hearing these noises my immediate thought was...""what are people doing out here"", when my daughter asked what was that dad? If you've ever heard a panther cry in the wild, than that was the closest animal sound I could explain to my daughter that we might have heard. Immediately after telling her that I heard her take a quick deep breath and quickly looked in the direction she was when I saw what I cannot describe as any animal I have seen in 25 years. I saw something dark brown, upright and moving very quickly across the row between the trees. My daughter asks "" dad, what was that"" when I replied ""I don't know"". I kill 10 to 13ft alligators for sport and am not easily frightened. This animal made the hair on my arms stand on end and chills run down my body. After studdering in my nervousness, we finally got the four wheeler started and sped off to our house. On the ride home, after i had in my own mind dismissed all other possible animals, told my daughter that I believe what we saw was a Sasquatch. The next day after work my dad, daughter and I went back to the location to look for hair, footprints or any other signs of the animal with no results. The sand was too soft to even make out the pig tracks. I did however stand with my daughter and have my dad walk to where we saw this animal and do a size comparison. We estimated it to be between 7 to 7 1/2 feet tall and 2 feet wide. Pigs and other 4 legged animals are low and long so I know for sure that's not what this was. So after hearing these sounds and seeing what we saw, the only animal that I can compare to it was a Sasquatch.",,Polk County,Florida,Spring,27.93531,-81.87347,5/16/13,41265,Class B,86.57,74.575,62.58,0.21,Partly cloudy in the afternoon.
"Today me, my mother and my son were coming back from a doctors appointment for my son. We were driving along a road that we have been many times. It's a nice little stretch of road with a great view. The land is beautiful with lots of natural Florida woods with swamp areas. There are also many orange groves in this area. It's not uncommon to see turkeys, hogs and occasional deer. The pasture land has cows on it from time to time. When this sighting happened there were no cows around. It was about 12:15 pm. The weather was over cast and it was going to rain at any minute. No other cars around. We passed one after the sighting down the road when we turned around to go back. We have had a ton of rain in this area lately. As we were traveling down the road we came up on this swampy area in a very large oak hammock. My 17 yr old son was the first to ask if me and my mother saw that? My 72 year old mother said yes but what was it? I said I saw it too...we keep driving for about 2 minutes we said nothing then my mother said turn around and go back. We all saw something and we need to go back and look. So I turned around and went back. But it was not there as far as we could see. We pulled up to the area and just sat there. All of us trying to figure out what we saw. We all saw a human like figure standing out in the middle of the marshy swampy area up to it's waist in water. The figured appeared to be a dull brown color. It was wide across the shoulders with hair and looked like moss hanging from it. It was standing up with it's long limbs away from it's body. The head was kinda down. The shape of the head was different. My oldest son described the head as different from a human. We are not sure what exactly it was doing. In the past we have seen cows out in this marshy swampy area. My Mother was trying to justify what she saw hating to admit that it was beyond strange. But she did admit at how very strange it was. I turned the truck around and we headed home. We talked about it a little more and then just let it die. We had a very stressful morning after coming from an appointment to see if my son had cancer. He did not and we were all so dazed seeing that was over kill.

"While driving through the Ocala National Forest in Fl on Highway 19 a couple of years ago, I look from my car window to the right and saw what I believe was a big foot looking back at me.  It was in a cleared area that had probably been controlled burned at some point, so I clearly could see a figure covered with dark brown fur from head to toe.  It stood about seven feet tall and had the shape of a man, not a monkey.  It was broad in the shoulders and narrower at the waist.  It gazed at me half behind a tree, not shy or fearful, but as if it was in its own element and it was noticing me driving by on the highway.  It moved behind the tree out of my sight as I drove by.  There is never much traffic on this road thru the forest. I never saw it again on any trips.",,Putnam County,Florida,Spring,29.49577,-81.74579,6/7/10,35529,Class A,93.61,81.825,70.04,0.83,Humid throughout the day.
"My husband and I were driving home on I-75, the day after Christmas. Our car just started to accelerate after being in traffic for over an hour due to an accident. My husband was watching the cars closely and I was observing the environment on my left side, as I normally do on a road trip. I looked over to my right and saw something large and black about a football field distance away. At first it looked like it wasn't moving, but I kept watching and after a few seconds I saw an arm extend and it move forward towards the woods. My first instinct was to think it was a bear, but then as I continued to fixate on the animal, I realized it had very long black hair and was extremely broad in the shoulder/lat area. I continued to watch it move forward  very slowly and realized it was in a crouched position but looked as flat and large as the top of a car, from my view. The whole experience was very surreal to me and I think I'm still in shock.

"My son and I were out fishing one night in July of 2011 at about 1am on friday night at the Matanza bridge back waters, this is on A1A in Florida. at about 2:00 am, we heard this really weird sound of howling and grunts so we sat there for about 25 minutes or so and the sound kept getting louder and closer to where we were parked. My son said to me dad did you see that, I said what and he said something really big was approaching where we were parked sitting in the car. So he winded up the window and said we better leave, so i said no just wait a little bit longer and lets see if it will come back. after about another 10 minutes or so the howling began again but this time it seemed to be more than one howl, as if there was a reply to the deeper howl. So I told him to start the car and lets get out of the area. Well he did so and we were leaving the area and after we traveled about 100 yards or so there it was one of the biggest Bigfoots right in front of us. It was about 9 feet tall really hairy and walking with a slight crouched posture, It was headed East to the ocean.

"Just last Saturday, February, 23rd, I was in Twelve Mile Swamp Conservation Area which is just north of the St. Augustine, FL Airport, bordered on the north by International Golf Parkway and running from Rte 1 on the east border to Rte 95 on the west. I had driven about 3 miles from Rte 1 west bound on International Golf Parkway to a trail entrance. I drove southward about 1.5 miles into the area then east about 1 mile when the road I was on ended at a cross road where several large pieces of logging machinery were parked. I had been knocking, hooting, whistling, talking for about 45 minutes out in the open, right in this intersection when I heard sticks breaking from something walking towards me in the woods. As it got nearer I heard several heavy, bipedal footsteps, almost stomping, coming very close to the wood line bordering the road. Then loud thrashing and intentionally loud moving about from just within the treeline, in the trees and behind 6 foot reeds/brush just on the other side of the drainage ditch between the road and woods. The noise was only 20 yards from me but I couldn't see anything as I stood on the edge of the road and peered in. Whatever it was, was very big and it sounded as if it was about to break into the open. I could not smell anything, nor had I felt I had been being watched. It approached quickly and with determination. I became nervous and walked back to my car about 50 ft. behind me. I was so sure something would break through the brush that I got in my car and turned it around for a possible quick getaway, back the way I had come. When I got out quickly and walked back to near the noise it was gone. I remained probably an hour trying to draw whatever it was back, but nothing. The reeds/brush were fairly thick but not super thick like a line of Palmetto. I was confused as to why I couldn't see anything or even brush moving. But the noise was loud and obvious and very close.

"I live in The Villages, Florida which is a community encompassing three counties (Sumter, Lake, and Marion).  Behind my house there is one of those high tower power line paths.  On the other side, there are more homes.  The area is urban, but close to wooded areas.  One night in early to mid-December my partner and I were sitting on our lanai (as we do nightly).  It was about 10:00 p.m. or so.  Suddenly the quiet was broken by a loud cry which sounded like it was coming from close to the street.  We looked at each other and asked each other jokingly, “Is that Bigfoot?”  It did not sound like any human we had ever heard. We listened and no more sounds.  The next night, I was sitting on the lanai, my partner had not yet come out, about 9:00 p.m.  I stopped the sound on my computer and just then I heard, distinctly, two rocks clack together at the end of my short backyard, close to where my neighbor to the left and I share a property line close.  There are tall, 6-7 foot, plants at the end of my property. I sat there for maybe 15 minutes listening and heard nothing more.  A few days later, for two days, my partner and I came out and smelled a strange, unknown, odor.  My dog didn’t make any noise but sniffed the air.   It wasn’t a bad odor, just unusual.  A few days later, I was again sitting on the lanai, about 11:00 p.m. and to my left I heard a stone hit the side of my home which made it vibrate.  I sat quietly for a few minutes and went back to my business.  An hour later, when I got ready to go inside, I heard what sounded like 4-5 pebbles hitting the side of the lanai where I was standing.  About 3 nights ago, my partner and I were sitting on the lanai again, this time it was lightly raining.  It was about 11:30 p.m.  Suddenly we heard a barrage of pebbles hit the side of the lanai.   My partner said, those were stones.  I was unsure if it could have been the rain.  A few moments later, another barrage of pebbles hit our lanai.  My dog got up and looked.  It was not the gentle rain we were hearing.  After the second time, we didn’t hear anything else.  I don’t know if this is even possible to be bothered by a Bigfoot in The Villages.  We are the only ones who sit on our lanai after dark in this area.  What do you think?

"I was out behind my house smoking, walking my dogs around 6:30 pm, just before dark. My back yard is grass for about 100 yards then it is medium to heavy woods (about 4 acres total). My dogs just froze in place looking towards the woods. I was asking them whats wrong, what do you see? They stayed still, gazing into the woods for about a minute. I also looked towards the woods but saw nothing but trees and I could make out a large tree stump, then they both ran from me back into the house through a the doggy door on the North side of my house. When looking towards the woods they are to the East of me. I kept staring at the woods looking side to side while still seeing nothing. My cigarette was done, I tossed it onto the ground and went to step on it when I noticed some movement about 20 yards in the woods. It was towards the tree stump...I watched as this stump, which was about 3 to 4 foot tall stand up and double its size... I was in shock, it seemed like it was not real. I stayed motionless while watching this thing, which clearly was NO tree stump start to walk deeper into the woods, heavy steps each time it walked, it was between 7' or 8 feet tall, had hair/fur covering it. The way I could tell this is because it was walking in a zig zag motion, purposely I guess to try and hide from me behind trees. The sun would only shine in spots through the top of the trees and I could see the hair/fur shine maybe every 5 seconds or so/ This thing made noise/sound only twice from itself, once when it first rose up, I interpreted it as a ""Damn now I have to move"" moan/grunt... second when he/she looked at me right before it got to the gas line road (which is a dirt, right of way road for the gas company) almost to tell me, you stay where you are, don't follow me and I had no plans on that.... I went back out the next day, dogs refused to go with me, to see if there was something it was doing in the woods and found nothing. Also went to the dirt road looking for prints but found only a part of one because of deer and other animals walking over them. I believe this thing, and others follow the deer here for food, the [Suwannee River] State Park has a no Hunting buffer I think that is 5 or 10 miles out from the park. The deer know this and I am sure if these things have been here for a while also know that people don't hunt around here..

This thing had medium to dark reddish/brown hair/fur, when it snarled/growled at me. I saw fingers, no hair on the palms because I could see skin, no facial hair.

"A friend and I decided to go boating one Saturday morning and went to Scotts landing in Nassau County, Florida on the St Marys River. We rented a boat and headed west up the St Marys River into Georgia.  We traveled west about 15 miles where we went around a bend and our motor must have hit something in the water and shut off.  We drifted to the bank on the Georgia side of the river where we tried to start the boat with no success. This was about 3:30 pm with about 3 hours of light left as it is getting dark about 6pm. There was a fishing camp on the Florida side of the river with no one there so we paddled over to that side where we settled in and built a campfire to spend the night as our phones had no service. We settled by the fire and talked and had a good time. Around 12:30AM we began to hear something moving thru the woods from far off. We could tell it was moving towards us because the breaking branches and snapping twigs and crunching leaves were getting louder. When it got down to the rivers edge across from us we heard grunting and growling as well as stomping on the ground that was extremely loud and a deep base thud. I got up and walked down to the rivers edge and started shining the opposite bank. As I was shining I could hear something moving thru the brush towards me. As it got directly across from me I saw it thru the brush and could see a shoulder and head moving left straight across from me. I could see it moving for about 5 to 6 feet before it came to a tree where it stepped out from behind the tree and looked directly at me. I shined the light in its face and saw two red eyes and a head and right shoulder. When the light hit it in the face it turned its head back to the direction it came from and took off back that way. It seemed mad cuz it started stomping and growling and breaking limbs again. It continued to raise hell for another hour to hour and a half before it went quiet. Of course we did not sleep that night and at the first light we got in the boat and started rowing towards home and made it about 5 miles where we were picked up by the Nassau County police boat and towed another 10 1/2 miles back to Scotts Landing.  It was a truly amazing experience for me, my buddy however didn't agree with me. He said he was frozen with fear and will never return there. I myself would love to return and search for the creature.","I have found the location on google earth, we were at 30degrees 42'18.54"" N 82 degrees 02'16.20""W elevation 11ft",Nassau County,Florida,Winter,30.71004,-82.0443,12/8/12,39080,Class A,70.81,65.37,59.93,0.83,Foggy starting in the evening.

"Late at night as my family and I were setting off fireworks, we heard something growl loud enough for all of us to hear. My daughters boyfriend, a policeman said he thought it was a ""bear"" just in the treeline off to our left which was very close. Since we do have black bears, I picked up my grandbaby and we all stepped back as my husband and daughter's boyfriend had a look around. Something crashed away into the woods and was gone. The crazy thing is that the sound was nothing like we had ever heard before and we've been here a long time. I might add that we recently completely fenced the area which makes it even more odd. Accessing the yard would be hard for a bear now. Our dogs did not bark but, we had been setting off fireworks, so, I kind of let them off the hook! This occurred again about a month later in August. I had stepped out on the back porch to get a soda from the refrigerator. I felt the hair on my neck stand up and about that time, I heard the same low growling noise straight in front of me that we had heard in July. Then, I heard rustling and what sounded like someone running into or hitting the side of our wooden shed out back very loudly. I yelled to my husband and ran out behind the shed with a spotlight. I saw nothing, and there was no noise of something running away. The woods are thick there so, someone or something would only have to stand a few feet away to disappear. The dogs finally decided to bark when I yelled at my husband, but then, they are kind of lazy and could have been sleeping. Amazingly enough, they are always manage to be awake long enough to eat.","From Deland, FL go W on SR 44 across the St. Johns River. Take first right on CR 42.

"I want to start out by saying that I have never discussed this with anyone except for one other person. I have not discussed it with my wife, my best friend, or any other person close to me in my life. I was fortunate to have a coworker who had, many years ago, shared a similar personal experience that he had in Utah. He is the only person with whom I have shared my experience. I also want to say that what I am about to describe to you has tormented me for the last several months. I cannot emphasize enough how this encounter has affected me emotionally. Thanks to the encouragement of a fantastic confidant, I am now coming forward to report the incident as a step toward putting it behind me and getting on with my life. I did not ask for this, and had the event been within my control, I would have absolutely chosen not to have the experience. My life was perfectly fine with my previous view of reality, as incomplete and skewed as it may have been. I grew up in a very rural setting, and have always loved the outdoors and being in nature. I love to spend time in the beautiful wetlands and forests of Florida’s vast uninhabited wilderness areas. Monday through Friday, I work as an executive in a very large multinational corporation based in Orlando, FL, and being shut up in an office building throughout the week makes me stir-crazy. My life is a very high-stress environment, with responsibilities that include a multi-million dollar P&L, and oversight of approximately 1,000 employees. My weekends are often spent decompressing in nature through hiking or canoeing, especially in the winter months when the temperature is more comfortable. On the morning of Sunday, January 15th, I was visiting friends in Lake Mack, FL, which is a very small community located in a rural area of Central Florida about 10 miles west of Deland, FL, and about 30 miles from my home. To get to this area, go west on HW 44 out of Deland. Highway 44 will curve south just before the drawbridge that crosses the St. Johns River. The Pier 44 Marina will be on the left and is visible from the drawbridge. Immediately after crossing the drawbridge from Volusia into Lake County, turn right onto County Road 42 and continue west for about four miles. If approaching on the westbound side of the road, the Lake Mack community will be located on the south (left) side of CR 42, and the Ocala National Forest on the north (right). CR 42 traverses the southern edge of the 600 square mile Ocala National Forest. Having never been to Lake Mack prior to the 15th, I had earlier looked at the Google Maps application installed on my Blackberry to get directions. I noticed that the Ocala National Forest was just across the road, and saw that there were several forest service roads that crisscrossed the southern portion of the forest. I decided that after my visit, I would go drive through the forest and possibly do some exploring and hiking. I finished up in Lake Mack about noon and drove west on CR 42 for about 1 mile, and turned right onto Deerhaven Road and proceeded north into the forest. Deerhaven Road is paved for about the first 2 or 3 miles until it turns into National Forest Service Road 420, which to my surprise was a one-lane, very bumpy, unpaved road. Initially, I was very nervous about continuing, but the dirt-road was compacted and my car appeared to handle it with no problems. Feeling a bit more comfortable, I continued deeper into the woods. I drove for what I would estimate to be another 3 miles or so. The road passed through an area that appeared to have been burned in the past by a forest fire, as most of the pines were dead and only a very thick 3 to 5 ft layer of saw palmetto and other scrubby bushes covered the ground. In this area, the visibility was better due to the lack of a forest canopy and I could see the forest line about a mile in the distance. At this point, the road was still good, and so I continued driving until I the road left the burned zone and entered the tree line into a heavily forested area. I would estimate that after about ½ to 1 mile into the forested area, I started to notice an increasing amount of soft sand in the road rather than the hardened more compacted dirt that I had been driving on previously. I got nervous and decided to turn around and go back out of the forest on NFS 420 the same way that I had entered. At that moment I felt the car sink into sand. I quickly steered left up on the side of the road so that I could get turned around. I was able to get the car turned around in the opposite direction, but when I moved forward about a foot, the car sank deep in the sand. I tried for some period of time to get unstuck, but ended up only digging the tires deeper into the sand. It dawned on me what a stupid idea it was to bring a car into the backcountry—lesson learned. So here I was, in one of the wildest and most remote areas in the State of Florida completely stranded and all alone. I decided to try to dig out the wheels. I was down on my knees next to the front driver’s side tire digging the sand with my hands. After a few minutes of this, I stood upright to stretch my back out of the hunched position I had been in. When I stood up, a rock pelted me and a shooting pain went through the inside of my left thigh near the groin area, which caused me to jump back and yelp in pain. Because I was leaning forward against the fender of the car, the rock bounced off my leg and onto the hood of the car, and then slid slowly down the hood and into the sand, which, to my relief, told me that it was not a bullet or snakebite. I immediately looked toward the forest on the other side of the road from where the rock came, and perceived movement in the bushes. At this point, I did not see the creature, but did see movement in the branches and leaves of the shrubs, grasses and saw palmetto. The movement was enough to convince me that someone or something was there, and that it—whatever it was—was the source of the rock. Unsure of what to do, I stood there for about 30 seconds and checked my surroundings, including the road to the east and west, and the forest that was immediately behind me. After I turned back from looking into the trees behind me, I heard movement in the forest behind me. The sound that I heard was the sound of leaves and sticks being crushed on the ground, as if someone took one step and then stopped. The sound appeared to come from about 15 feet in the woods behind me. So now at this point, I had perceived movement in the woods on both sides of the road immediately in front of and behind me. I looked back again into the trees behind me where the noise originated, but saw nothing. At this point, the fear struck me pretty hard. Several things crossed my mind, such as wild hogs, bears and coyotes. But none of those animals obviously, to my knowledge, were capable of throwing rocks. Then the thought crossed my mind that perhaps there were a couple of people who had decided to have a little fun at my expense.  So, I called out into the forest, “Who’s there? This isn’t funny. I need help getting my car out of the sand. Please help me,” and so on. I heard nothing in reply and saw no movement. With the fear mounting and my thoughts turning more toward protection rather than getting my car unstuck, I remembered that I had a can of UDAP in my backpack in the trunk. The previous summer, I had hiked part of the Appalachian Trail in Tennessee and North Carolina and had purchased a couple of cans of UDAP for that trip. I walked around the back of the car, opened the trunk and pulled out my backpack. When I slammed the trunk shut, I again heard movement in the trees on the south side of the road and the location from which the rock had been thrown. I looked to my right and began unzipping the backpack when the creature started to make a hissing sound, though up to this point I still had not visually identified the animal. It was a very loud hissing sound, similar to what you might hear from a feral cat that is being cornered, only much, much louder and deeper. It then started to alternate between a hiss and a vocalization that sounded like “haaaaawwwww”. So the sound it was making was a protracted “hhhiiiiiissssssssssssssss, haaaaawwwwwww, hhhiiiiissssssssssssssss, haaaaawwwwwwww,” with an intermittent deeper gurgling sound interspersed throughout. Hearing this put me into flight mode, and I immediately got in the car and locked the doors. When I slammed the door, I looked across the passenger seat out through the passenger side window and saw the creature about 15 feet into the woods as it got up and stood up on two legs. It was out of view previously, as I was able to later conclude, because it had been in a completely prostate position in or behind about 3 or 4 feet of saw palmetto. I saw its head rise up first, then its back, then it appeared to go to all fours, and finally pushed itself up with its long arms onto two legs. I briefly saw its side profile as it did not turn and face me directly, but rather stood up facing east in parallel to the road. Once it rose up completely on two legs, its head was obscured by the tree branches above, while at the same time, its feet and legs were obscured by the saw palmetto and other bushes below. So, at this point, I was looking at its torso through about a 3 to 4 foot clearing between the scrub below and the branches above. To say the least, I was completely petrified. I was locked in my car, but absolutely did not feel safe at all. I would estimate that the creature was about 8 feet tall. It was extremely bulky across the bust, with very muscular arms, and I have no doubt that it could have easily busted out the windows and ripped me to shreds if it so desired. It stood there for what I would estimate to be about 3 seconds. I also observed what would commonly be described as a “love-handle”, around the side of the belly area and back. The creature’s hair was black and gray in color and was slicked down against the lighter skin, which could be seen in some places through what appeared to be wet hair. The hair was very thick on the arms and shoulders but less so around the side belly and back areas. It appeared to be wet because the hair was slicked down against the skin. After standing there for approximately three seconds, it hunched forward and walked east in parallel to the road and was immediately out of sight in the trees. Just before the first step, when the creature hunched forward, it put its hands forward to grab onto some branches, which allowed me to get a glimpse of its right hand. From what I could see, the top of the hand and arm was very hairy. It had about 3 inches of hair hanging down from the wrist area that was longer than the rest of the hair on its arm. One thing that stood out to me: when the arm swung up, I noticed the palm area was much lighter than the rest of the arm, almost a light grey or even off-white color, which was in stark contrast to the much darker hair that covered the other areas of the arm, torso and back. As it swam through the bushes, I could see the trees move and shake as it moved forward through the woods along the side of the road. It walked through the scrub for what I would estimate to be about 15 or 20 feet, and then stopped, again completely obscured from my view. Also, the hissing and other vocalization had stopped at this point and everything was completely quiet. After about a minute had passed of no further movement, I saw a tiny dark portion of the creature peek out from behind a pine tree that was growing near the side of the road about 15 or 20 feet in front of me. I could not perceive any detail at this point whatsoever, just that it was hiding and peaking from behind the tree. It appeared to be crouching down because the peek appeared about 3 or maybe 4 feet up the side of the pine tree from the base of the tree on the ground. It was obvious to me that the creature had previously responded to the slamming of the car door and trunk. Not knowing what else to do, I laid down on the horn and started opening and slamming shut the driver’s side door hoping that such nuisance noises would drive it out of the area. It did in fact evoke a response, but not the one I was hoping for. After about 15 seconds of door-slamming and horn-honking, the creature lumbered slowly on all fours in sort of a crouched position from behind the tree onto the side of the road right along the tree line. I quickly slammed the door shut. As soon as the door slammed, the creature reared back and flung a soft-ball sized amount of slimy brown, lumpy material that was about the consistency and color of “wet” peanut butter all over the hood of the car. It slid down the hood and onto the sand in front of the car, leaving a wet residue on the hood. It then put its arms forward, moving out of the crouched position, and then quickly crossed the road in front of me using both its arms and legs to walk on all fours, just like a four-legged animal. It looked back at me briefly and then disappeared into the tree line on the opposite side of the road. One thing I noticed at this point is that the creature was completely soaking wet from head to toe. When it flung the material at the car, I saw water drops shake off of the arm. It was very wet with the hair laying slicked to the skin, much like what you might see with a wet, long-haired dog. The face of the creature was a dark grey color, with very large dark eyes. It had a very large mouth with extremely large, fat lips. The nose was human-like, with one exception, which was large, slightly flared nostrils. The nose did not protrude off its face in proportion to a human’s, but was flatter and more sunken. The creature looked like an ape, but with facial features—especially the nasal area—that were very similar to those of humans. I resumed honking the horn, but did not open the door because I did not have eye contact with it and further knew that it was now in the forest on the same side of the road where I was sitting in the driver’s seat. I did not want to give it the advantage of an open door should it decide to jump out of the woods to my immediate left and attack the car. About 1 minute after disappearing into the tree line, the creature reemerged, this time walking completely upright on two legs, just like a human. It paused at the tree line for a second, and then took one huge step back across the road. The creature, to my shock and horror, was carrying along a “child” of the same creature. It had both arms of the smaller creature grasped in its right hand, and was dangling the juvenile along by its side, with the legs of the smaller creature almost touching the ground. The smaller creature appeared to be completely limp from the neck down, but its eyes were open and it was moving its head and looking toward the trees to which it was being carried. After crossing the road, the creature paused at the tree line on the opposite side of the road, lifted the juvenile up onto its hip, and continued into the scrub. Just before disappearing, the small creature wrapped its legs around the back and stomach and clung to the creature’s chest with its arms. Basically, it was carrying the smaller creature in the same way that a human would carry a child on the hip. It did not reemerge from that point forward, nor did I see any sign or hint of it again. I would estimate that the smaller creature was about three feet tall. It was also a different color than the adult, with the child being more of a light brown, with possibly some hints of a red and blonde, versus the black and grey color of the adult. One thing that stood out about the child is that it appeared to be very, very thin, almost to the point of appearing emaciated. I could actually see the outline of the ribs through the skin and hair that covered it. I sat petrified in my car for about an hour until I looked up and saw two hunters driving Jeeps down the road toward me. They were kind enough to pull my car out of the sand, and quickly got me going on my way out of the forest. Once I got on HWY 44, I left the area at about 85 mph and never looked back. I was in a state of complete shock over what I had experienced. Prior to this experience, I was not a Bigfoot believer.

I waited ten minutes for my luggage, then left the station to take CR42 West to Lady Lake. It was between 4 and 4:30 pm while I was driving that I noticed something running on someone's farm land. There were cows gathered in a pasture near the house. The creature was running in their direction but at a long even stride. I was probably about 150 yds away on the highway. It was brown/black in color and was the same all over. The stride was long, maybe about 3 1/2 to 4 ft. between steps. The creature looked at least 6' ft tall. It was the first thing I thought of as it was on two legs and all the other animals were on four. It looked out of place. No one else was around as far as I could see. The creature was running along the fence line. Which should be mentioned is that CR42 runs the southern edge of the Ocala National Forest where sightings have been seen.

"I was in my car going south on ___ towards ________ to run errands on a bright sunny Saturday morning. I came around the last curve of the road where it straightens out towards ________. I looked down at the temperature on my car and it said 86 and I saw a blue SUV coming towards me in the other lane. I thought nothing of the SUV until this tall creature stepped onto the road and in two steps had crossed the lane I was driving in and was into the left lane and my view of it was then obstructed. It was completely covered in thick hair, all the way to the pavement. I couldn't see any feet and it was about 1/8 mile away so I didn't see any facial features.

"I never got a visual. I was hog hunting/scouting an area with fresh activity. The first thing I noticed were some unusual scrapings on some tree's, higher up than any animal found here. Really paid little to no attention to that until after the fact. I went further into a game trail and I heard a noise as if someone, or something was flanking me. It moved when I moved. As it grew darker I changed my direction and then began hearing a screech/growl that I was unfamilar with. Raised the hairs on my neck and I got out of there. I went home and told my wife and we laughed it off. I studied the satellite imagery for the area and chose a close by location for the following day. The following day I enetered thick brush on a game trail working my way back to a dried up lake with a clearing. The brush on either side of me was so thick you couldn't enter if you wanted. I heard, again, something walking with me, and another audible screech/growl, followed by what sounded like a large stick hitting a tree several times. I exited the area fastly. I went to another area 1/2 mile away and walked a horse trail. I experienced the same audible noise and then the tree hitting again. As I approached I felt the ground as it seemed as tho something were stomping or pounding it just off the trails edge. Then a rock was thrown in my direction followed by that screech/growl and then I could hear all hell break loose into the woods.

"We were driving up 73rd Ave E, in Myakka City, Florida. The road has been used infrequently due to the recent storms. As we were passing East at Long Creek I looked to the left and saw what looked like a pile of dark Spanish moss looking grass. I thought to myself that it was odd to see a large pile of soggy grass and moss that was oddly shaped so symmetrically. Then I saw that it was a creature standing  trying not to be seen and as still as can be. I couldn’t speak, I couldn’t process what I was seeing and then the words left my mouth... “Honey” I said to my husband, “I just saw a Sasquatch by the side of the road crouching down”. He could tell by the look on my face that I had, in fact, seen something. I still can’t believe it, I’m chuckling nervously talking about it... unbelievable. It was a dark mound of crouched flesh and soggy hair. I could not see it’s face just the pointed head and massive shoulders. The fence is 4.5’ tall and it was another 3’ higher and just as wide. No one is ever going to believe me, but I just had to report it.","73rd Avenue E at Long Creek, which are the wetlands near the Myakka River.",Manatee County,Florida,Summer,27.40743,-82.12901,6/1/18,59537,Class B,86.53,79.665,72.8,0.6,Partly cloudy in the morning and humid throughout the day.
"It was last bow season around the middle of sept in Ocala Na.forest, I was in the tree 1/2 hour before daylight, i had an encounter with a black bear 2 or 3 days before in the same area, it came out on the trail on the way to my stand 20 yards away from me, i have a game cam on my bow that takes good video, & i took a video of it crossing in front of me to show my wife that all the bears that i tell her about were real, Now she believes there are bears, But knowing how & what bears look like in the wild & sound like when they are running away or walking to you, this was no bear, around 45 mins after daylight i felt like something was watching me then i heard a loud sound like a big tree had fallen, but it wasn't one, it was something big that been thrown at my direction, maybe 250 feet away then a scream like i have never heard before let out like a pissed off kid that had not gotten his way & it left in front of me crossing back & forth as if it was trying to let some others know to run or get out of the area , scared  the S#&*^%$ out of me as bad as it made out a scream, the scream went till i could not hear it anymore ,at least a 1000 yards away, i was in the Lake Delancy west back area i think it was off 66 not to far from the Ocklawaha river, to this day i will never go back to this area with out a gun even during bow season , till i see what that was i will not trust the Ocala area.Thank god for my Fla gun permit, i am not a little girl, just not stupid, Hope this helps you find something to prove that they are here , but  you don't have to convince me i am 99% sure thats what i heard , I live in Middleburg where a lot of your sightings take place in Florida, i hunt Camp Blanding & Jennings Forest where i lived off live oak lane till i was 17, i have walked all of that area & when i was 12 i was chased by something for a 1/4 mile 1/2 hour before dark, it smelled like nothing i had ever smelled i my life & it had a grunt i will never forget , it gave me the same felling that something was watching me just like in Ocala, but i didn't see what it was that time either, i was in too much of a hurry to get away & home to a safe place, my Grandmother if she was still alive would tell you that i never opened the front screen door, i busted right threw it & grabbed my 22 rifle & sat on the floor waiting for it, lucky for me it had stopped the chase 100's of yards before my home, but i wasn't taking that chance, to this day i still will not go anywhere with out a gun close, I am 6ft 1inch &275 lbs, but i am not a fool.

"On February 21, 2012 at aprox 2:55pm while traveling on a back county heavily wooded road in Ocala Florida, I observed an animal coming out of the woods on the South side of the road heading North. From this distance I first thought this was a bear coming across the road, however I did notice that the way this animal carried himself did not appear to be a bear. The animal was walking on all fours but appeared to be larger in the front of his body but lower in the hind end, much unlike a bear. He seemed to be bobbing up and down and seemed to me that it was injured. As I approached closer I could see that he was walking on the knuckles of his front arms, appearance was dark brown shaggy coat, not like smooth sheen coat or  fur that would be on a Florida black bear. As the animal approached the edge of pavement, he then stood up on it's hind legs with a slight curvature and legs bent, he then crossed the road on its hind legs arms swaying or swinging (longer appearance of arms as that of a primate)as I approach closer to the animal and start to slow my vehicle down, this animal turned its head and glanced partially, (matter of factly). At this point I could tell there were no ears such that a bear would have and knew it definitely was not a Florida black. The upper body was massive and as it went down to the hind quarters got increasing smaller. I would estimate that this animal would be 7ft aprox. weight would be around 400 lbs (my best guess).I could not tell what the hind feet looked like due to the amount of hair but I did note that they were longer than that of a bear. As he neared the edge of opposite side of the road he then returned to walk on all fours and as he entered the edge of the wooded area he stood upright again placing right arm on a pine tree, looked over at me and at this i was at a stand still in my vehicle, I could see a full face. Distance from the animal was 50-60ft away.I could tell that he had more of a round shaped eyes, from this distance they appeared to be dark in color with a lighter color of hair around eyes (short and greyish brown, older in  appearance) same hair color would be around the side of face and what would be the area where the ears would be. The nose appeared to be shorter than that of a bear but different than an ape, didn't have a larger lower lip or chin. the area where the mouth and nose is was short hair and skin appearance.I could also see that the long hair on the arms did not go all the way to the hand area. Hands seemed from that distance to have five fingers much like that of a primate would have. At this point he entered the wooded area and was out of sight.",,Marion County,Florida,Winter,29.16722,-82.01917,2/21/12,33764,Class A,73.71,63.175,52.64,0.99,Mostly cloudy in the afternoon.
I was out trail riding in a remote part of the Ocala National Forest when I became stuck in a mud hole. I was out there for several hours waiting for someone to come pull me out. What got my attention first was the sound of someone hitting something against a tree which striked me as odd considering where I was at and I didn't hear any other vehicles prior to the knock so I proceeded to approach the sounds after walking about 300 yards away from my vehicle I saw what I thought was a huge man in a ghillie suit striking a pine tree with a large stick as I got closer I realized it was not a man but a huge creature that I will never forget as long as I live. It had a huge chest probably 60in. across and though it was in a slumped standing position it had to be 8 feet tall with long muscular arms and long chest and mid section like its legs were shorter than chest area. As I was trying slowly to back away to get back to my truck I stepped on a stick and it immediately turned to look at me using its whole body to do so and then it ran off caring stick in a graceful stride through the woods.,Off of woods road 572A by squirels nest meadow.,Marion County,Florida,Fall,28.99496,-81.59869,11/11/12,37275,Class A,79.21,69.355,59.5,0.92,Mostly cloudy starting in the evening.
"I was walking my dog on October 18th, at around 9:00 to 9:10....We had just got back from dinner. We live in a subdivision that backs to the Ocala National Forest. As I was walking towards the end of the subdivision, where there is nothing but open land and empty lots, with some sporadic trees. While turning around, I saw a figure crouching down.  It immediately caught me off guard and quite frankly scared the sh*t out of me.  The minute I spotted the figure, I pulled back on my dog and grabbed my gun.... (I have a permit to carry and we have had a lot of neighbors reporting bears and wildlife in this area) I backed away from the figure and yelled, ""I got a gun, I will shoot you....**and other things.. I had the leash in my left hand along with my flashlight.  As I shinned the flashlight at this figure again, I yelled at it again.. ""I will shoot you, I'm not kidding!""  Thinking this was a hoax of some kind.  My light caught this figure's face and I got a reflective shine back at me.... The figure stood up and walked behind this small patch of trees.  This figure was huge.  Looked just like a large ape man, covered in hair. I pulled my dog back with me, and got the heck out of the area.  I didn't see where it went to after this.","Ocala Fl - Subdivision, specific street omitted.

"We were driving two jeeps through the forest, driving along the inner perimeter road of Hopkins Prairie. We saw a structure in the distance and wanted to know what it was. Found what appeared to be a concrete boat ramp in the middle of the Prairie. We didn't know the name of where we were until till we started to leave. Looking across the prairie towards the campground (which we also didn't know was there) when appeared this large creature at about 100 to 150 yards away. We just stood there not saying a word at first. I remember saying to myself ""look at those shoulders"". It was moving around the edge of the campground right where the grass for the prairie starts. I wear glasses and I had them on so I could see but not as well as the others. I do remember it was just kind of walking in a small area like it was trying to decide what it was going to do and I remember its arms were long just down by its side and swaying. I don't think it saw us. It turned and walked up into the campground and disappeared. We drove over to the camp ground still not knowing it was a campground to look around. The campground was closed so we went around the fence. We went to where we saw it and noticed a footprint in the wet ground. We also noticed spots where it walked through the tall grass. My nephew tried to step out the places it appeared to step but the stride was to wide for him. We didn't see anyone at the campground, and it appeared that no one had been to the campground. On the way in to the prairie and before the sighting we saw an abundance of wildlife which I thought was odd. We saw turkey, deer, panther tracks (which we have a picture of) and on the way out after the sighting we saw a black bear that we took video of. All of these animals except for the bear we saw within a matter of minutes of each other. When we saw the creature we just stood there, didn't reach for cameras. I never even thought to take of picture but we did take pictures of the other animals.

"May of 2013 I am a wildlife photographer and at this point had photographed just about every animal in Florida with the exception of the endangered Florida Panther. My goal was to go primitive camping in the Big Cypress region of the Florida Everglades while hoping to photograph a Panther. My very first day was a success.  I had ridden my mountain bike several miles at approximately 9:30-10:30 am.  A quick early rain shower let up and I road off to look around to see what this area would yield in the way of tracks, etc.  I road past a female panther and didn’t have a clue she was just off the road in the Palmetto’s that lined the edge of the road.  I stopped a thousand foot away or so and there she was as I looked back, standing in the middle of the road of which I just passed peering in the opposite direction. I went back and followed her quietly until she exited the road to my left and back into the thick swamp like area.  I eventually was blessed enough to take over 100 photos of her as I had waited for her to possibly exit just a few hundred feet further down the road. She came to me as I was hiding behind a power pole.  She eventually crossed over towards me and I left.  I photographed 2 panther (an approx. 160lb male & 100lb female), 3 black bear, a bobcat and a 13 foot aggressive alligator in the middle of the road and numerous snakes and other alligators.  I camped in my location for 9 nights and left the 10th day early.  I felt it was sure enough the right time to leave.  I was 23 miles out and the only camper at this location. On the 8th night, a bear or something entered my site and ransacked the empty water bottles in the designated fire pit.  I exited my tent and shined my light towards the pit and didn’t see anything and soon went back into my tent to try and get some rest. On the 9th evening at 9:30, I had just finished reading my bible and turned the LED lantern off.  As I laid on top of my sleeping bag and ready to get some sleep, a tree had fallen 20 feet or so in front of my tent with an extremely huge thud, or so I thought it was a tree.  I waited for a few minutes while I listened intently and then I heard the palmetto fronds swoosh open as something exited them and stood just 15 foot or so on my right side of the tent.  It then whistled like a human would (typical dog calling whistle) and another answered it back to my left side.   This happened twice and then stopped. I knew it was not like any other bird call or animal I have ever witnessed in the wilds.  Never heard a bird or animal that sounded like mankind while photographing in the woods.  Within a minute, the thing walked up behind my tent and gave a guttural growl of sorts. I wasn’t going to stick my head or flashlight outside to see what it was either.  I prayed to God for protection and I simply was frightened enough to think myself into denial and went to sleep.  No, I didn’t smell anything and it didn’t touch my tent either, and no tracks could be found because of the grass that covered the hard limestone.  The limb that snapped was only about 5 inches in diameter and 15 or so feet off the ground.  I looked at the limb and area the next morning and realized something large had fallen making the sound of a fallen tree.  Time to vacate. I went back with a close friend and he and I never saw another panther or bear or a bobcat for that matter.  We did discover one man that had been frightened by something that he described being as large as a moose.  His tent was vacated.  He said the thing was at least 7 or so feet tall hiding behind bushes just staring at him one night.  It startled him so bad, his truck was now his refuge.  No telling what it was. I have heard things (noises) in the woods that no other animal in Florida make.  Growls, knocks and running on two feet through swamps.  I am hoping to get a photo of whatever it/they might be.","Black Bear Island, Campsite #4",Monroe County,Florida,Spring,26.18326,-81.24751,5/15/13,65655,Class B,85.81,71.445,57.08,0.18,Partly cloudy throughout the day.
"On December 2014 I was out hunting with my nephew in Big Cypress National Park. We entered the hunting area into Monroe station, we walked the trail that day and there's an open field pass on the trail to the right. We cut through the open field it was a very nice day but we didn't see any game. We were there till 6 pm between 6 pm and 615' we were heading out through the middle of the field towards Tamiami trail to cut through the woods onto the trail. It was still good light out, just before we entered the woods my nephew decides to go across the other woods to see the other side of the field while I wait for him. I was out in the open, I was away from the tree line about 60 yards. I noticed a movement from the distance when I look it was walking big steps right where we had hiked, from what it seemed like it was following us in the distance. I was really scared, I started shouting for my nephew. But wouldn't get my eye off of it. It stood behind a tree moving its head gently side too side looking at me. I was gonna point at it with my rifle too see it through my scope but I didn't because at the same time I thought what if its a ranger on a ghille suit? I didn't want to point at him with my rifle. My nephew came running when he got to me he told me did you see that in the woods. I told him no, look at where I'm looking and tell me my eyes aren't playing tricks on me. He looked, and looked at me, cocked his gun and we ran into the woods to cross over to the trail. By the time we got to the trail running it was night fall. Luckily there was a man in a buggy with his wife. And gave us a ride out...what I saw was approximately 4 street blocks away.

"A large blackish - brown figure walked out from behind a clump of trees along the eastbound side of I-10.  It stepped out from behind the bushes, looked at traffic then ducked back down into woods. UPDATE from witness Randy K. I have had a sighting in this same area, on the East bound lane of I-10. I have submitted a detailed report [see report #63433] and have discussed with one of your researchers. This creature matches somewhat the published reports of the same area, that being near the Crestview exit. What I saw was impossible to fake with a costume. The creature was approx. 8 feet tall and had obviously articulated muscles as it moved from the edge of the road, down a gully and into the tree line. The movement, particularly down a deep slope and up the other side would make it almost impossible for a human in a suit to accomplish. There was an additional car with witnesses.

"NW Florida, March 22, 2013. Me and my brother were driving South (me behind the wheel) on Hwy 85 about 7 miles south of Crestview Florida at 1:30am when we spotted what at first we thought was a really big black bear on the side of the road (West shoulder) next to the woods. I decided to make a U-turn at the next open medium to get a better look as big bear sightings in this area are not all that common; Usually they are very small black bears. We took a U-turn at an open medium about a 1/2 mile from the initial sighting and started heading back North. We got to the point where we had first seen what we thought was a large bear and started looking across the median for it. My Brother looked to his right and spotted the thing that we had seen. It had apparently crossed the highway putting it now on the East side of the road. When we looked we saw a large upright walking (like a human) black big foot type of creature. It paused, looked like it turned its head toward us, and ran into the woods. It was too large to be a human and it definately was not a bear.

"My daughter attends the University of West Florida and I had just finished getting her settled in her dorm room, stocked up on groceries and other essentials. I left in the late morning to head back home which is East of Pensacola some three plus hours. All through the first hour or so there were tremendous rain bands like we are used to here in Florida. As I was traveling on Interstate 10 the trailer trucks would put up a literal fog of water spray so I wasn't going more than 50 mph. As I got out of the last rain band the sky got brighter and brighter to the point where I could get back up to 70 mph. I was still following a car at about 10 car lengths. I checked the rear view and no traffic behind and I remember looking around the car ahead and nothing for some distance. I was just about ready to pass the white car when he put on his brakes and I closed distance to him fairly quickly. I braked also not knowing what was ahead of him - maybe a truck tire carcass and he could swerve into my lane as I pass him. Even though I am driving a p/u truck I ride a motorcycle and sort of drive like I ride, very defensively. As I slowed I noticed some movement off the road, we were both in the right lane. On the other side of the guard rail something caught my eye. We had just come over either a swampy area or a small creek so there was a guard rail over that area. Still there was a gully between the guard rail and the tree line, maybe 20 feet deep. Almost instantly I thought bear but wrong color. Our bear here are jet black and if they stand and you have the rare chance to see that, they aren't very tall. In the next thought I had was man in a gillie suit but wrong again. This was not material. It was hair! Matted down, wet hair. And the height, maybe 8 feet. It was huge. So as I saw it, by this time I was almost stopped, the car ahead directly abeam of the creature and stopped or very slow. What I saw was a living creature, everything articulated perfectly, head, arms, and legs. I had a profile to a back view of it, saw its muscles in the upper back. The color wasn't exactly uniform but varied between shades of chocolate brown. The head looked rounded. I couldn't see ears or a neck but it definitively had a head and looked down before stepping into the gully. At that time I saw arms that moved but really saw the separate legs and saw what was matted hair stuck together from the leg. It stepped down, rounded the gully and out the other side to go into the tree line. Its motion was very smooth, almost like it was gliding. So even if a man could don a suit and act like an eight foot tall living creature, how did he manage to walk down a steep embankment that was grassy and wet? Any human would be on his ass or tumble dangerously down that embankment. Anyway I hurriedly called the wife who laughed at me for a minute or two but then realized I was serious. She said get the license plate of the car (which I didn't) and where are you. I was surprised that I hadn't done all that. Frankly I think I was dazed. Well I know there is someone else that saw this thing. But that is about all. I would estimate this thing weighed about 4-500 pounds, it wasn't fat or barrel chested. It wasn't skinny either like it didn't have enough to eat. It was healthy and athletic in appearance and it sure covered a difficult area in no time.

"Went on a afternoon hike and decided to stop at the clear cut where big powers lines are to see if I could see a deer or something. I jumped up numerous turkey and deer while hiking. So I parked the car, rolled down the windows, shut the car off and just listened and watched. Not even 10 mins go by and this large black thing just starts walking across the open all the way to the other side. I get out of the car to get closer to see it, soon as I do that it see’s me then steps into the tree line . I hurried back to my car and watched from the cab. I called an individual and on the phone with them while I’m still watching it. At first before I started recording I noticed it and for a second I thought a hiker or hunter.

"I have a few, where I live in Charlotte county, borders the web reserve, and is woods for miles and miles, when I started to build my home, just after hurricane Charlie, I had an rv trailer on my property to live in while my home was being built, so I could keep an eye on the building supplies, I had a hot tub outside of my trailer and I would take a soak in it every other night or so usually after midnight, many times I would hear what would sound like someone smacking 2 2x4s together some distance away, and sometimes it would come from different directions, I would sit there thinking to myself why in the world is someone working out here in the woods at 1am, but I just blew it off, after the home was built I didn't hear the wood smacking anymore, because I was in my home and not outside late at night, then I had a deck built on the front of my home, my home is a 2 story home and the deck is on the second floor in the front, after the deck was built we started using it at night and would you believe it I started hearing the sticks hitting again every once in a while not every night, still I was thinking to my self why is someone working so late at night, then I was watching a bigfoot show and saw that they bang sticks together to talk to each other and then it all made sense to me, about 5 months ago one of my lids to one of my fish boxes were lifted off and about 20lbs of mullet were taken out of my boat in my yard, I went out to my boat around 3am to get ready to go fishing and during my walkaround of the boat to check the lights and tires I noticed my ice box lid not on, the lid weighs around 40 to 45lbs and has a bungee cord on it, the bungee cord was still attached but the lid was pulled to the side and fish were taken, and I had a weird feeling that something was looking at me so i fixed the lid and jumped into my truck and drove off, also about 3 or 4 months ago I took my son on a cubscout camp out and we had a small group of around 12 to 15 children, usually there are over 1000 people at a camp out but this time it was just our pack on a special camp, I woke around 230am to use the bathroom and then laid down to go to sleep then I heard a yell that lasted for about 10 seconds and it sounded like one of the yells that I have heard returned on one of the shows on tv, I was born and raised in the woods in fla and am a commercial fisherman and know all the sounds that you will hear in the woods and near shore, and in fla we have a bunch, some from normal animals like foxes or bobcat or panthers will make you get chicken skin and your hair stand on end, but the yell I heard that night was like nothing I've ever heard, it didnt scare me but I knew what it was.",(specific directions omitted),Charlotte County,Florida,Winter,26.91675,-81.96517,5/7/12,35330,Class B,87.45,77.55,67.65,0.56,Partly cloudy in the evening.
"I have hunted in most of the management areas in and around this state. I was on a bow hunt in the Citrus wildlife management area. I go out 1 hour or so before daylight. I had put my stand out the day before and just parked in pitch black dark area. I got out and walked to the other side of the suv to get my stuff out, before I could do that I heard something jump out of the bushes behind me. I stood motionless and a strong smell of defecation was there. I talked about the smell and it disappeared. I opened the door and got my flashlight to see what was there and it was gone. By the time daylight rolled around there was six or so more cars that had come through and wipe out all tracks that I could have found. This was the first of 5 incidents of it.   2. Two weeks later I moved my stand to a different area due to all the other hunters. I went out an hour before daylight again and parked got in my stand and waiting for daylight. Right before daylight I heard a call unlike anything I have ever heard before. I have heard hogs, deer, and all other types of animal calls including bears. This call was not like any of them. As the morning went by more cars and hunters came into the area. I heard something big running towards me and it sat down 20 to 30 feet in front of me on the only blind spot I had. I waited for about ten minutes and figured another hunter had sat there, so I cleared my throat to see if it was human and it got up and ran off real fast. I couldn't see it. 3. Two or three weeks later I decide to go fishing at the gulf and was driving past the area I hunted at when out of the wood line a big hairy, black bigfoot ran in front of me with my bright lights on. It took 3 leeps from woodline to woodline. the run is what floored me.

"Yesterday, on October 31st, 2010, I was hunting in Flying Eagle WMA with a friend when I discovered something that I thought was very unusual. It was around 10:20 in the morning when we decided to meet back up and do some scouting for our last afternoon hunt on my quota. I had set my friend up a few hundred yards or so from Hwy 44 in the morning before daylight and I continued on for about 3/4-1 mi. on the edge of the swamp we were hunting. As I continued on I jumped something that ran off and sounded unlike a deer or hog but didn't think anything of it. We were sitting on ground. After we met up we started walking back towards the truck and saw a couple of wet areas (puddles) when I said to my friend, let me check and see if there are any prints leading to the water to get a drink. As I walked over there to see I looked down and noticed something out of the ordinary. I called my friend over to show him. It was a footprint, similar to a humans. Not real large but kind of wide for the length of it. It was so fresh that you could still see the thermal lines in the mud from the bottom of the foot. It was the only one that we could really make out. The heal and ball made deep impressions while the toes were not really deep in the mud in comparison. I had my cell phone with me so I took two photos of the print and one of the area we were in then he marked a tree next to it so we could find it again. It just seemed very odd to find a print like that in the middle of a swamp! We returned after lunch for an afternoon hunt. I did notice one other thing with the squirrels after we returned. I didn't go as far this time, but I noticed the squirrels barking more than usual off in the distance. It is how they warn others of pending danger. As time went on they got closer and closer to where I was sitting and then all of a sudden went silent. Just an observation! I have spent most of my life in the woods in florida either hiking, biking or hunting this was the first time I noticed something like this. It is probably human but who would be out there barefoot?? We ended up laughing quite hard about it after we named him Eddie the Yeti and I will ad this is not the first time I have heard or smelt something out of the ordinary while in the woods.",Located in Flying Eagle WMA about 5 miles East of downtown Inverness.,Citrus County,Florida,Fall,28.84542,-82.20726,10/31/10,28450,Class B,84.03,72.11,60.19,0.8,Mostly cloudy until evening.
"A friend and I had been on Black creek in Clay county for a few hours bass fishing with absolutely no luck.  Working the last stretch of bank before we called it a day when I heard something walking in the woods.  I could hear large footsteps and something that sounded like it was scooping water or slapping water, I really can't describe the sound. Now I know this particular area and the wildlife that inhabits it pretty well I think, It is full of deer, wild boar, turkeys, a few black bears, and the rest of the small woodland critters.  And this sound was way too large to be any of them. Back to my story, after we heard the noise I motioned to my friend to be silent so I could trolling motor over to the bank so I could try to get a look.  As we were silently getting closer it seemed like the creature must have noticed us because we stuck out like a sore thumb against the back drop of the creek, while it stayed perfectly camoflauged in the wood.  We sat there for a few moments hoping it would move and reveal itself to us which it never did. So, as the sun was dropping we had to get back to the boat ramp, we quitely circled away from the shore.  Just as we got away from the tree line something landed in the water about 50 or so feet from the boat. It was a loud splash like a rock or heavy object was thrown because it hit about 15 feet from shore.  Both startled we put out life jackets on and got ready to leave when we heard the footstep start back up, and they sounded as if they were running away at a brisk pace and it sounded like it was a long stride. Jokingly we said we had just encountered a sasquatch just like every other time I heard something unusual on that body of water.  But as we made our way back to the dock I noticed we were within half a mile from powerlines.  And were within a mile of the county dump that I know for a fact is a popular spot with the local whitetail deer population.","250 yards west of the train tressel on the north bank.

"About this time 2 years ago, two of my friends and I were staying in my dads old trailer right off James Road, Naples Fl. It was around 9:30 p.m., when we started hearing what sounded like wolf howls. The howling become a bit terrifying when we noticed it was getting closer. We then began howling back at it, when we realized we were caught right in between these things communicating. By this time it was already 11:00 p.m., around this time small pebbles began being hurled at us from a distance. It reached such a freaky level when whatever was in the woods just 30 ft. from us was stomping and grunting at us. For some reason at some point we thought for sure it was a prank and began throwing pieces of wood and rocks, when all of a sudden a horrible silence came over us. With none of us wanting to admit we were freaking out, we suddenly mad dashed for the trailer and hid in my dad's room (end of the trailer, pointing to the woods). Trying to play it off we tried sleeping huddled together like a can of sardines. We were overcome by tears and in a frozen like state. Knocking and grunting was all we heard for about an hour, until we gave our position in the trailer when my friend whispered to me to look out the window. For the final time a deep silence overcame outside. I slightly lifted one of the curtain blinds (not sure what their called, but there a series or levers that lift and tilt depending on how you pull or twist the small stick). When I looked out, not fearing due to the fact there were no lights on in the trailer, I saw nothing but what seemed to be my reflection in the glass, I thought I had confirmed it when I tilted my head and my supposed reflection did the same. When I released the blind and was asked what I saw, I told them it was my reflection. I waited about 4 minutes, in which seemed like a millenium, I opened the blinds, I saw nothing but branches and brush. I remember slowly dropping the blind and crying myself to sleep in a way my friends wouldn't hear me. I can't explain why, but whatever was looking back at me through that window could've easily killed me considering the trailer was on an incline and bricks due to the jacks breaking. I would love to go back, which is crazy on my behalf but its alluring. I would submit to a polygraph in a heart beat to get someone out there with me.",We started in the back yard then walked a few blocks to the edge of the woods.,Collier County,Florida,Spring,26.03808,-81.64948,4/15/10,39382,Class B,81.23,71.815,62.4,0.04,Clear throughout the day.
"Sunday, March 11, 2012 shortly past midnight. We were camping in a primitive campsite at Bear Island, Big Cypress Preserve in Collier County Florida. This campsite is off of ORV trails, meaning only off-road vehicles with permits may enter this area. It was a warm evening after a late afternoon rain shower. We had a camp fire burning, there were five of us at camp that night along with two Jeeps parked away from campsite. After sitting near the campsite I wanted to retrieve my charging cell phone from my Jeep. As i walked away from the camp and into the darkness of the night, I reached my Jeep, as I was opening the door, I had a feeling someone was watching me. I looked to my left and about 15' into the woods I saw a pair of glowing yellow, human shaped eyes staring back at me. I am 6'6"" tall, and these eyes were level with me, possibly a few inches upward. I could feel the eyes staring into mine, and I watched them blink, slow and deliberate, just like a human. The overwhelming odor was undeniable it smelled like a combination of skunk and wet dog. Every hair on my body stood up right, I had instant goosebumps from my head to toe, and every instinct told me to flee. Without hesitation I quickly returned to the campfire.....Telling everyone what I had just witnessed, and assuring them I was not joking, I gathered a spotlight and a companion and walked over to check it out, without a sound we crept up, and heard nothing. Shining the light into the woods we did not see any signs of an animal, no deer, no bear, no low branches for an owl to be perched on, just a bare spot in the woods where the eyes were coming from. I have watched shows where people talk of Bigfoot sightings, and I always question them. I say I would have chased that thing through the woods with a camera and a flashlight. but now I understand, when you do see something like this, its a combination of shock, fear, and instinct. I would not write in with this sighting if I didn't feel in my gut, and in my mind what I saw, was not something that SHOULD have been in those woods.I was reassured of my feelings this past weekend when we returned to camp in the same spot. We camped in the same location this past weekend. April 28th-29th 2012. Pink jeep number 7, Bear Island Campground, Big Cypress Preserve. This encounter however was not visual, but audible. We had a campfire, there were five of us sitting there. It was approx 10:15, when I playfully made a loud and long howl (Call) into the woods. However we all were astounded when I almost Instantly got a response. The howl, was not a coyote, it was not an owl, or a bear. And it was not a human playing along. The direction the sound came from, was also the direction I had seen the eyes in the woods previously. It is dense woods with no campsites, or foot access. Forward an hour in the future. Me and my daughter and wife are in our tent. My two friends are already asleep in theirs, staked out next to mine. The back of both of our tents are facing the opposite woods that we had heard the howl from. After being in our tents and laying down with the lights out. We were startled, by the loudest crashing sound coming from the woods behind us. It sounded like something just grabbed a tree, snapped it, and smacked part of it against itself. The sound was followed by a few footsteps, then silence. It was so loud and an unexpected sound it awoke the two friends in the tent next to us with a ""what the heck was that? "". My daughter was the first to notice the odor that was suddenly lingering. Her and my wife compared it to skunk, i thought it smelled more like wet dog, urine smell. Very similar to the odor I noticed previously with the eye incident. I did scout the area where we heard the noise, but could not see anything. No fallen trees, and no obvious damage from where I could access. It did start to rain in the area early in the am. So when we woke up, it had been raining for sometime.Making it harder to notice anything out of place. Am I 100% positive I saw Skunk Ape? No, but I am 100% positive there is something down here, and it could be just that.

"This just happened to me about 5:15am this morning. I stepped out on the balcony of my second story apartment I'm in Atlantic Beach fl. I live about 3 to 5 min from Hannah park. I turned on the back porch light as I walked out.  I took about two or three steps out onto the balcony and I heard a loud screaching yell and then three woo whoo whoo noises. As I live and breathe that WAS the sound of a primate!! Immediately the dog in a fence of a neighbor's house right behind the apartment began barking like crazy for about 30 seconds and then stopped. It kind of freaked me out I thought, did an ape escape from Jax zoo or something? I crouched down a little on the balcony and watched the area. In about 5 min I could see the tree in the very back of the apartment back yard rustle a little and it was as if something was moving toward the fence. Then I heard two low grunts from the ground from inside the fence on the neighbors side. It is a privacy fence so I couldn't see what made the grunt. The way the fences are all I could hear were like footsteps moving along the fence toward the trees I saw one shadow really dark moving along the fenceline...it wasn't a person because the shoulders were way too wide and bulky and it wasn't even fully upright.

"I, a female lady, was driving on a clear day on I75 in the afternoon on a spring day from Sarasota to Tampa going north 65 to 70 miles per hour on the far right lane. This would be on the east side of I75. I had to take an exam in Tampa the next day so I know the exact date I was traveling. My window was slightly open on the passenger side to let the fresh air in. I was driving on the far right side of the highway in a heavily tropical wooded area when I saw what I first thought was a man walking fast about 50 feet away from the highway in like a grassy meadow with thick brush or tropical woods behind him. As I got closer I saw that it was not a man but a creature that looked like a man but with (approximately) three inch long brown hair covering it's body from head to foot. When I was parallel to the creature it quickly went into the brush/wooded area and disappeared. It looked like tall thick brush or woods. The creature looked like a male around I am guessing 6 to 7 feet tall with a thick body, thick legs, wide shoulders. I could see the brown body hair as it turned it's whole body all at once, bent its head, and went into the brush/woods. It was going north the same direction as me and walked quickly with wide steps with knees bent before it turned into the brush or woods. As I drove off I couldn't get over what I just saw.

"First, I’ll start with the fact that I have never put much stock into the Bigfoot phenomenon.  I have degrees in wildlife management and wildlife biology and I have been working as a biologist for the last 17 years.  I have never believed that something could exist that has never left any concrete evidence.  Furthermore, nothing similar has ever been found in the fossil record that I know of so that has lead me to believe it was all false, until this weekend (Nov 24, 2013). I am an avid birdwatcher and wildlife photographer.  I take very long hikes in various wild areas around Tampa this time of year to photograph whatever I find. I was hiking at Cypress Creek Preserve which is in between interstate 275 and 75 near the apex where they meet. I was walking on one of the rather wide trails and I came to a stop because I heard a noise.  I had seen quite a few wild pigs that morning and I thought I could photograph one crossing the trail in front of me.  I was looking down at my camera adjusting the ISO settings and I saw something large move out of the corner of my eye (to my left) approximately 200 feet away. As soon as I saw the movement I looked directly at it and it was already halfway across the trail at this point. My eyes were directly on the animal as it walked, upright, across the rest of the trail and into the palmettos. It was very large (at least 6 feet tall or more) completely black in color with a VERY wide chest from front to back.  It was walking completely upright with a very fast, purposeful pace. The animal was leaning forward slightly but did not seem awkward with its steps - like a bear would be while walking upright. I slowly walked over to the spot where I saw it cross and I could still hear it moving through the woods in the distance.  I immediately noticed that all the birds around me had stopped chirping and the insects had stopped making noise as well.  I looked for tracks or hair left on the plants in the area but found nothing.  I was able to get a picture of the palmetto on the trail where it crossed and I put my tripod near it for a height comparison.

As I began to approach the forest I heard a high pitched scream that I mistook as a bird at first, I then saw a large brown mass moving to my right in the trees in front of me.

"My Fiance had an accident at work last summer where he received burns on his hand and I had to take him to the burn center in Gainesville at Shands.  I was driving home with him in the car and he was asleep from the painkillers he was on due to his burns. I had my highbeams on and was going ~45mph down SR-16 eastbound near Starke/Camp Blanding. A creature ran across the road on all fours or heavily crouched over. It did not have a tail and in the high beams it looked blueish-grey. Its rear end was pushed up high from the ground, about 4 feet or so, but when it got to the other side of the road it stood up and ran on two legs. I noticed its face was very flat, with no snout or jawline, but with hair all around it. It happened very fast, but I am sure it wasn't a bear because I couldn't see a snout, and I'm sure it was not a panther because there was not a tail. Once it stood up it looked to be about 6 foot tall. Once it crossed the road it kept on running into the woods and never slowed down. While it was running on the asphalt it looked like a lemur running on all fours, once it hit the grass it stood up and continued running bipedally without skipping a beat and made maybe three steps until it was in the woods. I turned to my Fiance and asked ""did you see that?"" but he was unconscious. I didn't mention it earlier because I never really thought twice about it, but my fiance and i were watching TV and it was a bigfoot documentary, i asked him if he remembered the event, and he said no, but then told me to go ahead and report it to the BFRO.",Headed east from Gainesville on SR-16 between Starke and Camp Blanding.,Bradford County,Florida,Summer,29.97917,-81.85223,6/12/12,41503,Class A,90.88,82.105,73.33,0.79,"Rain starting in the afternoon, continuing until evening."
"I'm a fishing guide in Florida for over 25 years and spend apx 200 days on the water a year. On a charter last month I had a Delta pilot and lawyer on my boat. As we poled into a remote area of the Merrit island National Wildlife Refuge,I noticed something bent over and walking up a sand bank,apx 100 yards from us. It was just after good daylight. I thought bear?,hog? as it walked closer,one of my clients noticed it and said,""what the f(*& is that?"" I was speechless,it walked to within 40 yards,stood up and faced us for about 15 sec. It took 3 steps,turned sideways and looked at us over it's shoulder for another 10 sec,then walked into the mangroves. The pilot said that was a F(*& sasquatch! It was apx. 6/7 ft tall,long reddish brown hair, and was built like a side by side fridge,very square. It's face looked more cave man then ape.

"I was driving down state road at 9pm on 9/17/11. This road is good for heavy traffic and none at all. At the time I was the only car on the road going both directions.  I was headed south towards state road 528. 407 runs adjacent to the Canaveral marsh lands full of deer, hogs, birds and plenty of other native wild life. at 9:10 or so I saw what appeared to be a skunk ape cross the road right in front of me.  This road fits one car in each direction. The skunk ape appeared to be running because it crossed the road in 2 step very easily. After the second step it jumped down into the side embankment and into the bushes next to the road.  I did get a good look at it since I driving at a pace to avoid hitting deer that cross the road frequently. The animal had long hair all over its body. Especially on the arms and shoulders. This is the reason I know it was in a sprint. The hair was flowing like it would if it was blowing in the wind. The color of the hair seemed to be dark. Reflecting against my head lights and the moon light I really couldn't tell the color. It had a cone shaped head, Very longs arms. When it jumped down into the embankment the arms went up in the air as to help keep its balance or not hit anything .  I saw the side profile of the face. The face was dark ( again night time ) it seemed ape like. The feet where huge. as it took steps I noticed how large they were.  The over all body seemed very THICK. The animal was very muscular. From the side view I had , you could see just how thick of a body it was. I didn't stop to investigate due to the face that it was night time and I did not want to have a face to face with what ever I saw alone on a dark road. Thinking about the situation as it constantly replayed in my mind . I think it might have been in pursuit of a deer. I constantly see deer on that road at night into the early morning. This was my first time seeing a skunk ape, but I have heard they were sighted some times in the area further south on state road 520. I feel with the rise in the deer population it might have moved into the area.",south bound side of state road 407 adjacent to the Canaveral marsh lands,Brevard County,Florida,Summer,28.48899,-80.84716,9/17/11,30679,Class A,88.36,81.35,74.34,0.66,Partly cloudy in the morning and humid throughout the day.

About 30 minutes after climbing in the stand and settling down I noticed a musty, dank smell, kind of like a wild hog that's been in a wallow, but really swampy.  It kept getting stronger and keep in mind I'm about 100 yards off a dirt road in the woods.  I saw something about 7.5 - 8' tall step out from behind a tree, swaying back and forth looking at me from either side of the tree. I reached for my gun, and when I looked back up it was gone. I didn't see any tracks when I looked after I got out, I've never hunted that stand since Thanksgiving 2011.",Private Land,Randolph County,Georgia,Fall,31.71434,-84.60457,11/24/11,44571,Class B,69.2,52.72,36.24,0.98,Clear throughout the day.

"I think I might have seen a big foot on May 30, 2012.  I went outside to put my trash can at the street at about midnight. The only light was the porch lights on the house behind us.  When I walked around the corner of the house, I froze because I saw what looked like something standing at my neighbor's fence. They have a fence that is fenced in on three sides, just not at the front of the house, and what I saw was standing at the back of the fence, I think on my side of the fence, but not sure. All I could see was the silhouette of a person/thing, but it stood 1 1/2 to 2 feet over the top of the fence. All I could see was the silhouette of the shoulders and head and hair sticking up over the fence. It had long hair and it was not really moving.  Only the hair would move. At first I thought it was a person who had stopped and stood still when it saw me.  Then I realized it was way too big to be a person.  I admittedly have bad eyesight though, even with glasses on at night. On top of that I am a logical person with a master's degree, so I don't rush to conclusions, especially fanciful ones.  So I told myself it was just the shadows and light playing tricks on me.  I figured that something was propped up against the fence and just looked like a head and shoulders in the dark and that maybe the hair was some spanish moss caught on whatever it was. But I still felt uneasy and ran inside as fast as I could.  The next day (today) I went outside and looked for whatever it was that might have looked like a head and shoulders. But there as nothing there.  No plants, no trees, nothing propped up against the fence, no spanish moss, just a fence.  We went back outside tonight to look again and see if there was anything casting a funky shadow.  While that corner of the yard is dark and lights barely shine there from the windows, there was definitely nothing taller than the fence and nothing that looked like a head and shoulders. I would estimate, given that the fence is about 6 feet tall, that it was at least 7 1/2 to 8 1/2 feet tall.  It was broad shouldered. And it had long hair or fur on it's head.  I am not saying it was a bigfoot, because I could not see it well enough to say that for certain, but I don't think it was a person. If it was a person it was a very large, very tall, very hairy person.  Also, when I came back inside, my dog (a lab/border collie mix who is about 90 lbs) started growling.  He kept growling until I let him out of his kennel and he immediately ran to my back door.  I let him outside and he shot off.  Our yard is fenced in so he cannot leave the yard.  But ten minutes later when I went to let him back in, he wasn't near the back door. It took several minutes for him to come back to the door after I called repeatedly.  That is not like him.  He usually is begging to come back inside and doesn't hesitate when I call him.  After that he was very restless all night.",It was in a residential neighborhood.  Huntingdon Subdivision.

"IT WAS A COLD TUESDAY MORNING WHEN I WAS GOING OUT TO GET MY TWO DOGS TO PUT THEM IN THE KENNEL BEFORE I WENT OUT. I WAS STANDING ON THE FIRST STEP UP TO THE DOOR OUT BACK. I COULD SEE RIGHT OVER MY MUCH LARGER KENNEL. THIS LARGER KENNEL WAS AT LEAST 6 FEET TALL. ONE OF MY DOGS HAD JUST CAME IN. I WAS LOOKING FOR THE OTHER DOG.I WAS YELLING HIS NAME.

"It was roughly around the end of August 2011 and I was at my mothers house. The house is located in the Burnt Hickory area of Paulding County, GA. She lives in a subdivision but it is still out in the country. I have always been and still a night owl. I stepped out on her back deck around 0200 in the morning to have a cigarette. Behind her house is nothing but trees, shrubs, hills, and creeks. There is an abundance of wildlife in the area that range from deer to coyotes. I was a Reconnaissance Marine for 8 years with multiple deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan. I have been to numerous survival schools all over America from Maine to California. Most of my life was spent in the woods and I understand what animals make what sounds. I do not unnerve very easily. So back to my story. I was on the back deck smoking a cigarette when I heard this loud howl/scream. The first howl grabbed my attention instantly. Because I had only heard it one time I was unsure what it was. So I listened with a bit more interest the second time and I was trying to run everything through my mind to to figure out what it was. I knew it was not a deer or coyote because the howl was so deep. So then I started to think about my surroundings. There is a highway a couple miles away so I thought it may have been a big rig/semi. Then I heard it again. That option was completely ruled out. So I started to think of what else it could be. Perhaps it was a generator running in the woods. Again I heard the howl. Not a generator! I had run through so many different scenarios that I was starting to get freaked out. The howl was from a living creature and it was much larger than I. Each howl lasted approx. 5 seconds with a 10-15 second rest before the next. I stood out there for about 5 minutes before listening to this before I was to freaked and headed inside. I immediately ran up to my computer and googled howling sounds in Paulding County, GA. There were several websites regarding howling in the area but most of them were referring to Picketts Mill Battlefield. Then I came across BFRO. Initially I was like ""yeah...okay!"". I started looking through the website and I came across some of the audio submissions from Ohio. Once I heard it I nearly crapped my pants. That howl was to a T of what I heard. The only difference was mine sounded much deeper, closer, and I didn't have dogs barking in the background. I still get goosebumps thinking about it. I read through some of the other posts from Paulding County and Bartow County. What they all had to say was pretty freaky. Then I looked at the time frames they were made and where. During those time frames there was construction in the area. And when I heard my sounds they had just recently begun construction in the area. Not sure if there is any connection with that. I did bring it up to my wife the next day and she could hear the fear in my voice as I talked about it. Anyone that has been willing to listen I have mentioned it to.",,Paulding County,Georgia,Summer,34.06787,-84.79704,8/27/11,32254,Class B,92.65,80.18,67.71,0.94,Clear throughout the day.
"I was driving on Old Cartersville road towards HWY 61 just past the chicken farm but before the pond.  I had my 13 year old son with me. I saw what I thought was a bear crouched down on the right side of the road. I turned to tell my son to look at the bear. My son was in the back seat. Before I could turn back around all the way. I noticed it stood up on two legs. My son was asking what it was. Then I noticed it was over 7 foot 6 inches tall covered in long black hair. It was burley! It was all of 500-600 pounds. It was no more than 20-30 yards outside our truck window.  It was so large I could see its muscles in its legs (thighs). Its head appeared to sit on its shoulders like it had no neck. The head looked like it came to a point. It looked like a bipedal ape! It had something white in its hand! That's when it registered it had hands and not claws. The arms were longer than any human arms. They seemed to stretch closer to the knee area. When it walked the knees worked perfectly. It did not have a bow legged affect. Which made it seem human but it looked like an ape. It started to move towards the road walking on two legs. My lights stayed on it. It seemed to want out of my lights. When it walked for the road it was headed in the path of my truck. I was on a small curve. So my lights followed it. I hit my fog lights & it turned back from the direction it came. It picked up speed and started to run still on two legs. I could see the foot falls & the thigh muscles bounce. Also saw butt muscles flex all under the hair. It started moving so fast the white thing in its hand was almost a blur. The next day, I returned to the area. Where it ran off into the woods was uphill. I thought it was flat as fast as it was moving.

"Last year during the summer my wife and I were leaving work. We were riding together in my car leaving the Cedartown Ga airport where we skydive. It was about 7:00 7:30 in the evening the sun was starting to set, not dark but getting there. We were driving down Old Rockmart Rd headed to Rome Ga where we live. Old Rockmart Rd is the back way home about 15 miles long surrounded by woods, trees, fields, and pastures. My wife and I were talking back and forth about the day just driving home. Its starting to get dark and as we come to a straight away about a half a mile long with pastures on both sides of us fenced in, I see something big and black in front of us about 10 to 20 yards in my lane of the road I thought it was a cow so i slammed on the brakes at that time this figure (BIGFOOT) stood up from a crouched position standing about 8ft tall with long black hair turned and looked at us. I think the brakes squealing scared it, but it looked at us, the lights shined right on him. He covered his face from the head lights, he took about 2 steps into the side of the road where there was a fence post about 5 to 6 feet tall, put his left hand on the fence post and easily hopped over the fence and took off. Our windows were down, it made no sound plus couldn't hear over the sound of the car. But I could smell something dead or garbage, it smelled bad. He was about 8 feet tall and way bigger than a cow. But this was not a cow, I know what I saw, he was on two feet walking and hopped a fence and ran toward the woods. I was shocked at what I saw and so was my wife. This is my second sighting of bigfoot in the same state about 40 miles from my first sighting. My wife and i were speechless for about 15min.

There was something standing in the field about 30 yards from the road. It was around 8' tall. I could see the body and head, with the body extending down into the grass which is about 3' tall.

"I went to a favorite spot for the weekend to get some peace and quiet and hopefully a monster brown trout. Been going there for years fishing and camping. Not extremely remote but wild and beautiful none the less.Its actually an old home place that has long disappeared, nothing remains except the concrete foundation and a narrow overgrown road that was once the driveway.Was very cold the night before, mid 20s,but the sun was shining bright and it was starting to warm up. I made the relatively short hike down the old road bed to my spot by the river.I dropped my pack against a tree and went down the step embankment to the rivers edge to check out the water and soak up some sunshine to warm up.After a few minutes I heard what I thought was another fisherman or someone up above me where the old foundation was.I thought ""great,so much for peace and quiet, must be hardcore trout fisherman like me to be here in cold weather"". I walked back up the embankment expecting to see people,, what I saw in broad day light, probably 30-40yds directly in front of me was what I can only describe as what appeared to be a fully erect gorilla, except his face didn't protrude out,it was flatter,and the hair was the color of a squirrel, browns, black, silver & a slight tint of red when the sun reflected off him.He was standing there, head slightly tilted back, squinting his eyes,soaking up the sunshine, just as I was.I couldn't comprehend what I was looking at at first. My first thought was ""what am I looking at?"".. Second thought was"" God,look how big he is"". It was incredibly muscular, at least 4ft wide at shoulders, 7-8ft in height,massive animal. The skin was a dark grayish color around the face, head was extremely pointed, like a dunce hat almost, no neck,large pectorals visible under the hair. Eye color was like a shade of amber. It was squinting in the bright sun, soaking up some warmth. He didn't really see me at first I don't think.I did kinda pop up over the embankment, I think he knew I was there but didn't really know where .He could have been trying to smell me. I watched this massive beautiful animal standing there in the bright sun for probably 15-20 seconds.I had a feeling of amazement, wonder & actually privileged .I knew that what I was looking at was truly one of Gods immaculate creations. It was beautiful, big and scary as hell, but beautiful. Hair was clean, looked groomed almost. Very healthy animal. After 15-20 seconds of seeing this I actually stepped up over the embankment all the way in view and I said out loud something like ""hey big boy,ain't you a pretty thing!"" That's when it finally saw me. It dropped its head down & froze. I could tell I surprised it. It wouldn't make eye contact. I could see its whole posture change. It became very shy& acted like it was hoping that as long as it didn't look directly at me I wouldn't see him. It was like a bashful child.I took a few steps toward it and said ""hey big boy"" ,or something to that effect, and that was enough for him. He turned to his left and he was out of there. I could here the limbs & leaves rustling as he made his getaway. He moved like a deer going up the mountain, fast fast. Didn't see him but I could hear him. After probably 5 seconds the rustling stopped and it was totally silent. Then I clearly hear what sounded like someone doing a drum roll with wooden sticks on a wooden table. Three"" brat-tat-tat-tat's,very quick, very clear, definitely not a woodpecker. No doubt in my mind it was him. He had traversed the mountain side and was on the ridgeline above me in no more than 5-10 seconds. Unbelievable. I never felt threatened, never felt afraid. Was a feeling of privilege & respect. I set up camp and stayed at that spot for the night and all the next day but never saw it again. 'spent most of my life in those mountains walking feeder creeks,backpacking, fishing for brook trout.Thought I knew all there was to know.That day changed my life.

"My girlfriend and I were on vacation in Blue Ridge, GA. We went hiking the day before and the ground was frozen solid from the weather. The following day we went hiking and it rained the night before. It was very cloudy all day and still pretty cold but the ground was thawing out. We decided to hike the Benton-MacKaye Trail off Highway 515. We started at 8:45 a.m. and followed the trail around to an open field and decided to take a quick break. While on  the break, I yelled as loud as I could twice and the echo was impressive. We continued following the trail for another 1 1/2 hours until we decided to head back. On the way back around the field, we noticed a huge footprint. It was obvious it was a footprint because you could see the toes in the clay. The clay wasn't hard nor was it wet and slick. We passed it on the way and had no walking troubles or saw the print. There were footprints around other than ours, however, we didn't see anybody from the start of the trailhead and throughout the hike.  We looked around for more and discovered 4-5 more tracks the same size, others that looked similar but less defined. It was a very deep print, looked to have 4 toes.

"Hello BFRO, I golf three times a week and often up to a one hour drive from my home in Peachtree City GA.  I was very close to my home and near Fayetteville GA.  I was with three (3) other grown men and NO we had yet to open any cold beer.  We drove up to our tee box and a friend yelled at me - ""Dave look there's a bigfoot.""  All of us were about forty yards or so from a large black creature walking from left to right up a slight hill.  I watched for just a few seconds and swung the golf cart back up the hill and much closer to the woods & in the direction that the large creature was walking.  Mid December so near 50% of the leaves were OFF the trees / bushes that just several days before would not be able to see through.  Anyway I got closer to the woods and in that general direction of its walking.  Seemingly walking straight at us was a 7 foot or large large black creature.  I asked my buddy sitting beside me if it was walking AT US but he told me to GO to GO to GO as he wanted NO part of what we were watching.  I yelled at it and down it went behind a log or some debris.  It got up after just a few seconds and began to walk AWAY from us.  I kept yelling and it turned as the sun hit it and I saw the left side of its large shoulder and left side of its face.  It appeared to have fur like a beautiful jet black mink coat.  The shoulders and arms were HUGE.  We watched for just a few seconds as it disappeared over the hill going back the way it came into that wooded area.  Deer Hunting season had just begun in GA so it likely was pushed from its normal residence South of Whitewater Creek Golf Club and Fayetteville GA area.

"NOTICE: We are unsure of what we've seen! I live on a golf course in NE GA. I have lived in the area my entire life (23 years). Every sunday and wednesday, me and my buddy Brandon play 18 holes. It was sprinkling rain so we were trying to finsih up the round quickly. As we pulled up to the green on #17 we witnessed what appeared to be about a 6ft animal jump out of a tree, easily 25ft in the air. It hit the ground with a tremendous thud and faster than I could imagine running it jetted deep into the tree line. We initially thought it was a moutntain lion because of the color. It was light brown, almost a sandy color. However, I believe it was simply too large to be a cat of any type. We then immediately thought perhaps a black bear was molting and was in its ""cinnamon"" color phase, but i dont think its possible for a bear to move this quickly.

We had just made that turn and gone a mile and a half when my husband and myself saw a large figure standing in the tree line.  There was illumination coming from the right side of the road from an additional light source other than our car headlights.  This enabled us to clearly see this figure that was on the left side of the road with one arm straight down and the other arm slightly moving.  I believe that arm movement is what caught our attention making us both look to our left CLEARLY allowing us both to view this creature.

"I was photographing the sunrise on Sat 4th February in the morning on the frozen shore of Big Spirit Lake in northern Iowa, it was about 5am, so I had to wait until daylight. I shut off my vehicle, walked out towards the lake and stopped to listen to the ice cracking on the lake. To the North of me I heard three very distinct sounds that I would say we're 'wood knocks', I am reluctant to say that because I don't want to pigeon hole what I heard, I would estimate the distance of the noise to have been within 1/4 mile or so. In response to that I heard from the South at a closer distance the sound of, and I can only describe it as bottles being moved in a trash can. The temp was 4 deg and there were no other vehicles in the area, it is a state campground, but obviously shut for the winter. I saw no ice fishermen in the area until about 6am or later. It was as if the 'whatever it was' to the South was being alerted to my presence by a lookout. I would not consider the area to be highly wooded, but there is an abundance of deer and they obviously hide well in the area.

"I took my son Myles fishing behind Sundown Mountain ski resort. We turned west off of Asbury road on to Twin Springs Drive, where there is access to the stream. I had been promising my son some night fishing. We sat on a couple of buckets facing south, to the rock out cropping and wooded area across the creek. We were fishing in the deeper water across the creek near the rocks. We heard sticks breaking and rustling which I assumed were coons, as this is a good coon area. Then we noticed something larger coming toward the other side of the creek from a distance. Thinking that this is one of many deer that we often see, thought nothing of it until we caught sight of it in the back-light of the city or moon from the other side of the hill we were facing. This was a large bipedal animal, very unlikely to be a person, this time of night without a light (although we were fishing without a light source also). It came up to the top of the rock out cropping direct across from us and stood between two trees. It then squatted down and just sat there watching us. My son was scared, and I was intrigued. Within 10 minutes another came to join the first to his right and stayed just across a ravine. No more than 6 minutes later another came from the south, just to the left of the one squatting across from us. As this one got close, it let out a piercing shriek. Nothing like the calls that are heard on the TV shows. This was high pitched and frightening. The other two took notice and began to move toward the shrieking Squatch.

"I like to go to Gotch Park and watch the Eagles. I used to stand in the middle of the bridge for a cigarette before I went home from work. I had done this a few days in a row.

"While mule deer hunting in Idaho, I road my atv to the snow line on road 255 southwest of Atlanta. I passed a truck with Alaska plates. It was parked on the side of the road with no one around just where the snow started. I was forced to turn around due to deep snow about a mile from the truck up hill from it.  I observed many large elk tracks in the snow so I decided to move down in elevation to glass the timber strips.  Elk season started in 3 days so I want to see if any were in this area. Once at the location about a half mile down hill past the truck, I parked on the side of the road. About 5 minutes into my search I heard a knock to my right about level with me about 300 yards away (guess). Very loud and solid.  I first thought it was two trees hitting each other from wind. The wind was light though.  About 5 minutes later it happened again but the knock sounded different and a bit lower. Within 10 minutes the Alaska truck drove by me with just a driver.  He headed down elevation from me. I continued to glass this area without a sound for a good 5 minutes. I heard a vehicle coming up the hill and that person stopped to talk to me.  He was a friend of mine from my old home town in California.  Small world.  I knew he liked this area and was happy to see him.  We started to compare our hunting apps on our phones. Come to find out he was camped about 1.5 miles from my camp. We talked for a few minutes and then a loud knock like I heard before.  A bit closer and near level to us.  He stopped mid sentence for a second and turned to the direction of the sound but kept talking. A truck came by with a family in it and stopped to talk. I told him the snow situation and he headed up.  He returned within 5 minutes and headed down the road to lower elevation. We heard 1 more knock lower and like further away (not as loud) after the truck passed us.  My friend said, ""What the hell is that??""   I joked, ""Bigfoot!""  He immediately said it is someone splitting wood. When we heard 3 more in the next 20 minutes I told him that wood cutter sure takes his time between splits. Then it happened....a knock behind us with a different tone and it seemed farther away..  Then another below and to our right but not as loud as the other knocks. Things went quiet for 10 minutes. We said see you later.  He headed up the road toward the snow line. It didn't take long and he was back and drove by me with a wave.  I have not talked to him since then.

"On Tuesday (Dec. 4th, 2012) I woke up to my dogs alarm barking out in their outside kennel.  I grabbed a large flashlight on my way to the back door.  I was most worried about it being a skunk that was causing the dogs to bark, as I have noticed once in a great while, that I have caught the scent of a skunk early in the morning or in the middle of the night when I have stepped outside to quiet the dogs and I didn’t want to surprise one myself. So, I cautiously and quietly opened the back door, scanned around the kennel for any smelly, black and white creatures lurking about when I noticed some movement out of the corner of my eye. Something moved behind the fruit trees down by the junction of where our driveway and the road meet (about 50 ft. from the back door).  The moon was half full, but the night was clear and the moon was giving off a lot of light. I stepped out to better see what the movement was from; expecting a dog, deer or person to come into view, but what I saw was quite different.  Before I describe what I saw, let me just say that I have long taken the stand that there is no such thing as a Sasquatch and that if there were such a creature, we would have at least found some skeletal remains as proof. I am going to only give a description of what I saw, but not an explanation, because I do not have one. I stood in shock after this occurred, my mind reeling, trying to find a reasonable, logical explanation, but I could not find one. I want to also point out that I was fully awake, having been up and awake the 15 minutes before this occurred.  I have lived for decades in very rural areas next to large sections of DNR forest lands, I have seen my share of deer, bear, cougars, etc. in daytime and at night and that or a person is what I was expecting to see. So, I saw some movement and stepped out to better see what it was that was causing the commotion and disturbing the dogs, both of whom were now quiet and hiding in their dog houses. The movement to my right stilled for just a moment (it stood behind a plum tree), partially hidden from my view.  I turned on my  flashlight and it then  took off at breakneck speed up the road, running uphill.  It covering ground way too fast and did so on two legs! It was very tall, but I could only see its profile, so I have no idea of how broad it was. What I could clearly see is that it ran upright, with long strides, swinging its arms and it looked to me like it was covered in shreds. It had a slightly pointed head, no neck and appeared light colored, almost silvery gray, but that could be from the moonlight, which was giving everything a kind of slivery sheen that night.  It quickly glanced over its shoulder, but I couldn’t see any features other than noting that its head turned slightly, but it did not seem to slow down. Just where the road turns left, bearing around the corner, it made one great leap, planting one food on the pavement and clearing the grass/graveled side of the road, plus several feet of tall grass and smoothly plummeted out of sight down the steep embankment. The next morning when I went to look for any clues were I saw it leave the road we found that the grass (just where it meets the pavement) was matted down and there was a large game trail type hole in the bramble, just over the embankment. Nothing else, no clear tracks, no strips of cloth or fur, no other clues…I am stumped. I had made up my mind to not even tell anyone, because it sounds so unbelievable and because even talking about it is kind of disturbing.

My 14 year old daughter and her friend were quadding in the woods behind our property which are owned by timber companies. They stopped by the waterfalls to look around and came upon a large footprint on the timber trail. It had rained a couple of days prior to this. There are lots of cedar groves and pine in the area and lots of fresh water from streams and waterfalls. They took some pictures with their phones and with my daughter's friends foot next to it. They told me about it when they got home and showed me the picture. My daughter took me up there and we saw more prints coming down the hillside to the trail and crossing it into the cedars. The trail is not very wide so this is the only print on flat land. I tried to get a plaster cast but did not have enough plaster and it rained before I was able to get more plaster and the imprint was washed away.,About 10 miles south of Coeur d'Alene and 5 miles west of Hwy 95.,Kootenai County,Idaho,Summer,47.61947,-116.9945,6/15/10,30868,Class B,57.49,48.28,39.07,0.14,Clear throughout the day.
"In February of 2011 I was traveling down Highway 95 between Potlatch, Idaho, and Tensed, Idaho between 12:00 a.m. and 2:00 a.m. It was wooded pasture off to the right side of the highway and open grass pasture and creek on the left (drivers side) of the highway. I was driving into a curve before Wiegand Private Road when approximately 40-50 ft in front of me I saw a very large, dark form walk straight across the highway, right to left. I assumed it was a human so I slowed to full stop in the middle of the highway, which was empty both directions except for me. It was at this point that I realized that I could not see this person off the side of the highway or out in the grass pasture to my left. I had my high beams on and the area was very well lit from that. I developed an awful sense of dread and immediately hit the gas and headed for home, which was about 5-6 miles away. I was so bothered by this event that I continually checked my rear view mirror, fully expecting to see something horrible or have something horrible happen to me. Once I got home I bolted into the house, turned all the lights on, and woke my family up. They kind of laughed it off but my dog crawled up into my lap and whined/cried at me and wouldn't leave my side. I definitely didn't sleep that night and started avoiding driving that highway so late at night. It wasn't until later that I really started to process the details of what happened. I realized that I saw someone, very distinctly bipedal, walk across the highway. I remember the walking motion of the legs and the slight swinging motion of the arms. I also realized that while I had my high beams on the figure was completely black. No reflection from clothes, shoes, or even a shadow thrown onto the highway. The other thing that very much bothered me was that I never took my eyes off of what happened but somewhere between the figure walking across the highway and walking off the side, it disappeared. I definitely should have been able to see something walking down the side of the ditch or into the pasture, but it was completely empty. It took me quite some time to come to terms with what happened and even longer before I admitted to myself that it may have been a Sasquatch related sighting. I've recently been compelled to report this specific sighting due to the fact that recently a woman claimed to have seen a Sasquatch right before hitting a deer in almost the exact same area and a similar time frame but she's been made into a joke in the local news. I don't know if she actually saw Sasquatch, but I find it a very, very odd coincidence that it happened in that area of the highway and in the same time frame.",The last curve in the highway before Wiegand Private Road.,Latah County,Idaho,Winter,46.97822,-116.923,2/15/11,57248,Class A,37.31,34.28,31.25,0.42,Snow (2–4 in.) throughout the day.
"Hi. I don’t know how to start this off but here it goes: I am a 35 yr male disabled combat veteran (Iraq/Afghanistan) I’ve hunted this land for the last 5 years ish. It was the 9th of October and I had camp set up. Wife was getting off early and the kids were in school. They were coming to meet me there in the afternoon. I decided to go see if I could locate a small pocket of elk and shoot some grouse. I took my SxS down a normal trail that I somewhat frequent looking for my last 2 birds. It’s a old log road that dead ends. Immediately shot 1 soon as I got off the SxS. Got him and figured hey it’s a dead end, I’ll walk this and see if I can find fresh elk sign. I can show you on OnX where I was and can explain the terrain. Anyway, walked down maybe 1/2 mile at the beginning I kept jumping birds but always opposite of where I was. I went to the left the jumped 50-60 yards other side... get to a good opening and see a few wolf tracks. Big pile of bear shit. Decided to head back to check on my dogs and wait for the fam. Walking back was dead quiet as in awkward quiet no chirps no nothing, not like when I walked down. I got almost halfway back to my side by side and heard a knock... I know what a woodpecker sounds like.. I am not a believer (well idk now). So I thought maybe another hunter was in the timber so I speak out loudly “ohhh tree knocking huh!!!""  Then 2 knocks, I started laughing “Sasquatch is that you.."" silence for probably 10-15 seconds then 3 knocks no special order just odd timing knocks.  I make a joke of it “Have u seen any grouse I need one more” no answer, few seconds later knocks 2-3 maybe 4 .. I joke “ knock twice if your in New Hampshire (joking quoted anchorman movie) no knocks .. So I look thru my binos, not cheap shit, vortex viper 12x50... I looked for at least a min. One knock while I was glassing.. Started to feel really uneasy. Out loud said, ""Alright dude it’s not funny, at least wave a hand so I can see where you are! Again, I am grouse hunting with my 12gauge pump and don’t want to pepper someone when they're hid and I try to shoot a bird!"" Quiet for probably 30-45 seconds. I am glassing (thinking maybe someone put a blind up or something) but nothing. I unload my bird shot and put my 2 buckshots in followed by a slug. I tell them they're gonna get it and they need to show them self. Nothing, Was about to walk up the direction and just didn’t feel right. Kept my buckshot in and started to walk fast for the next 20 mins to my SxS. Got to my ride and still dead quiet... OK my area, potlatch land (timber company). I rode from camp 8.7 miles. Friday mid day. This is a dead end trail. I did not see anyone all day. No tracks, no tire marks, nothing. I know I was the only one out there. Went back to camp waited for my family. Told my wife and she said “You grew up in these woods. I don’t think you're crazy but I wasn’t there.” I am not crazy. I spend probably 7-8 months of the year in this area, never anything like this.","Longitude / Latitude: (copy and paste coordinates into Google Maps): 46.75473, -116.42915",Latah County,Idaho,Fall,46.75473,-116.4292,10/9/20,67401,Class B,69.67,57.94,46.21,0.75,Partly cloudy throughout the day.
"During an evening hunting trip the two of us were driving up a fairly rough patch of road looking for deer sign, it was the last day of the season and was pretty late, around 4 pm or so.  The weather was a little foggy with a light rain. I had stopped the truck to look up a small ridge about 300 or so yards away.  I saw what looked like a very large Bigfoot standing at the top of the ridge near a tree.  I told myself that it was probably just a large stump that looked like a silhouette of Bigfoot on the ridge.  I even pointed it out to my 12 year old son, that that stump looked just like a Bigfoot.  We both laughed and agreed that it did. We continued up the little road for less than 100 yards, and found that it was a dead end.  We turned around and on the way down I looked back to where I saw the stump, and it was gone!. Less than 3 minutes had gone by. I stopped the truck and told my son that the stump was gone.  We searched the skyline and couldn't find it again. To this day, I really do not know what that was on the skyline, and I am not convinced that it was in fact a Bigfoot (I am a beliver), but it was something that I can not explain.",,Lemhi County,Idaho,Fall,45.2704,-113.8186,10/15/14,59343,Class B,64.73,51.505,38.28,0.75,Mostly cloudy starting in the afternoon.
"Hello! I've grown up in Idaho around 18 years. I've hunted,fished and did all outdoor things like camping etc..  All over Idaho I have been outdoors and seen about every wild animals tracks,sounds and sign I thought was in this state. Before I found what I did I was a skeptic but not a believer  till this day.. I was living in Oregon at the time and had came back to visit family for the summer and spend my birthday with them, I was 24 at time. I went camping with 3 friend's that day. We got there around 2-3 in the afternoon. We set up our tents started a fire and we just sat around the fire talking until around 5. Then we decided to hike to the south east point of the rivers bend nearest to us. The hike there we had to go through lots of willows, brush,trees etc.. On the way there we ran into a cow moose and it had a calf moose with it. It was an intense stare down as I was not even 15 feet away from it and I could see it's hair on its back intensely sticking up as I started to move me and my friends around her. We got around here and ran into a young bull moose and found an old fallen down cabin. By the time we were done exploring around there we moved forward to the rivers end of the bend. I was at the front walking up on the bend point, it was thick with willows up until 15 feet from the flowing rivers water. That 15 feet was just pure sand all at the tip of this bend. I started to walk to the river's edge when I seen some huge prints walking out of the water up on to the sand bank about 8ft out of from the waters edge and then it walked slowly back into the water. It was one of the biggest most bizarre tracks I've seen and how they moved in and back in the water was just weird. I counted 10-11 tracks coming out of the water and back in the water. I wear size 12 shoe and my foot next to its foot made mine look small. It was approx 19in long and it looked just like ""a huge human footprint huge"". Its strides were over double mine and Im 6ft. I showed my friends and we looked for more tracks but that's all the tracks we could find was the ones coming from the water out of the water and into the water by that time it was starting to get dark and we needed a start the hike back so we started the hike back. It's something I've never seen and will never forget. That day I recorded the tracks and took pictures with my foot next to its foot but I of course lost the phone snowboarding in Bend the winter after. Its kinda creepy the unnatural sounds I've heard all over the mountains and woods across Eastern Idaho but never thought about bigfoot cause I had never found any FOR SURE tracks.

"During a camping trip along the north fork of the Coeur d'Alene river. We had recently finished dinner. While sitting fire side our dogs, a border collie and a pug leapt up and ran into the forest that separated the campsite from the creek. Neither made any sound but simply ran into the woods at twilight. Frustrated at the thought of chasing dogs in the woods at night I retrieved my flashlight from the cab of my truck. Upon approaching the tree line the dogs exploded out of the woods and ran to the truck where they cowered in fear staring into the woods. My initial fear was we were dealing with a cougar or bear. I retrieved my pistol from the console and instructed my girlfriend to put more wood on the fire. We managed to get the dogs out of the canopied bed where they had taken shelter and placed them into a spare tent. I approached the forest and while scanning the trees with my flashlight I caught sight of a large black Sasquatch standing behind a tree approx. 30 feet in front of me. I retreated back away from the woods and after a few minutes sat in my chair with my flashlight and pistol in my lap. Initial hope was that it would simply go away. My girlfriend was sitting about four feet away and after shouting into the forest that I was armed and would shoot if threatened. Then a large rock 8 inches long and 5 inches wide (I have the rock) came tumbling out of the trees and went between us grazing the top of the fire as it passed causing hot coals and sparks to fly against my dining canopy. We both jumped up out of surprise and while trying to keep an eye on the forest I was able to extinguish the hot coals burning the grass and canopy with an open soda. Out of fear and disgust I fired two rounds from the revolver into the air at a 45 degree angle. The creature then moved of to our left crunching undergrowth as it moved then stopped and we heard a large crack like that of a tree snapping and then the creature moved off to the right were it crossed the creek at the point where i had originally seen it. It made two loud splashes in the water and moved to the opposite shore where it was heard to be moving noisily up the hillside opposite our camp. We hastily gathered our more expensive gear and tossed it into the truck, leaving our tents, coolers and various items. We put the dogs in the cab, extinguished the fire and abandoned the camp. We drove 45 minutes home to Coeur d'Alene and returned the following morning to retrieve the remainder of our equipment. I found the large stone and kept it. We also discovered the tree snap was actually a twin pine about 5 inches in diameter that was broken about six feet up from the ground. No prints were seen as the ground was packed hard due to heavy use that summer. The creek was also running high.","[Investigator (MM) Note regarding location: The camp site described in this report is beside the North Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River, roughly half way between Bumblebee Meadows campground and the town of Linfor.

"We were camped along Marble Creek at Donkey Creek near Avery, ID. July 2019. It was a weekday, so no other campers were within miles. Deep mountain valleys and dense woods. I was chopping food for dinner. My husband and small children were fishing at the loud creek. I'm an avid birder. Obsessed. I must know every call I hear. And that evening, I heard a call that sounded like an old fashioned crank police siren. It was echoing through the valley and came from a higher altitude. Howls of the same timbre and pitch, but slightly varying length. I thought it was an owl I must not know. Wolves and cougar don't sound like that. My dog didn't bark. She hid under the table. I also considered that maybe some kids were playing with an old police siren. But then I realized there was no way kids could have been way up near the ridge with something that heavy, plus, no one else was up there. When I got back into cell reception, I searched through owl calls and found nothing similar. But I found that call on the BFRO site.

"I had a strange occurrence happen on August 8, 2020 at approximately 9:30 PM when I was camping on the Saint Joe River in Idaho. It is the second time I’ve had an experience by the Saint Joe River. I would rather give a verbal explanation to someone rather than trying to type it out. Basically the first one was about 8 years ago a neighboring camper was chopping wood for about 10 or 15 minutes and after he quit I heard two wood knocks above the road and above the campground that kind of freaked me out. I got up and went and looked and there was something on the road above us that was staring down at me don’t know what it was but it was there.

"Knowing that today was going to be one of the last sunny days, my husband and I went for a drive in the nearby mountains. I spend a lot of time in this specific location when I go four wheeler riding. From here I can hear anyone driving around this section of mountains. We got to the top of the mountain around 1:30 PM and decided to play a game of cribbage on the tailgate of our truck. We were there for about an hour listening to the quiet and birds and other little critters, when we heard what sounded like someone hitting a home run with a wooden base ball bat. The sound came from the southeast of us, maybe about 100 yards away. We both look at each other and we agreed that was a tree knock. We continued playing our game. I noticed that after this the birds stopped chirping for a while. It was very quiet, very quiet. Then at  3:14 PM we heard another knock. This one appeared to be about 50-75 yards north of the first knock.  At this time I told my husband let's hurry up and finish our game and walk over the direction the knocking came from. We finished the game then walked about 20 yards at this time I decided to do a howl and then I did one tree knock. Within 5 seconds we heard a knock back. This one came from the same direction of the second knock but sounded farther away. At that time we decided we should go back towards the truck. As we started walking back, we heard a fourth knock this one came from the west on the other side of our truck.

He has a dog that we bring along and like every other dog, he has the occasional need to relieve himself.

I was waiting outside when I saw a dark figure just beyond the tree line. It was massive, easily twice my height, and it just stood there, watching me.

I just stood there looking back at it, when suddenly it broke out into a stride along the length of the tree line and it silently disappeared into the night.

"On October 7, 2017, my wife, myself and our dog went on a late season kayak paddle to Upper Priest Lake and overnight camping trip at Beaver Creek Campground. After loading the kayak after our paddle, we drove ½ mile to the campground, only to find that it was closed for the season. Not wanting to find another campsite, we drove around the campground to the Tule Bay boat launch parking area, which was still open. We parked our vehicle, unloaded our tent, sleeping and cooking gear and began to set up camp, carrying things into a designated site that would normally be accessed by the campground road. I was a bit concerned about camping in the site after the campground was officially closed, but figured that as it was already getting dark, it was unlikely that we would be confronted by a ranger. It had been raining and was getting cold, and my wife wanted a campfire to warm up from our paddle to Upper Priest Lake. I didn’t want to start a fire, as I was still uneasy about camping there and concerned that a fire would attract attention to us. After setting up the tent and getting things situated, we heard a whoo call to the north of us, across the road. I had the distinct impression that it wasn’t an owl, but a person whooing for someone in the dark woods, like someone trying to contact a hiker who was late getting back to the car (though there were no other cars in the area). The call was quite loud, louder than any owl I have ever heard. Too me, it seemed like it was coming from something (a person) with large lung capacity. By this time, it was dark and we couldn’t see anything beneath the tree canopy outside of our campsite. While my wife worked on starting a fire with wet branches (unsuccessfully), I arranged our sleeping gear in the tent. Suddenly, we heard a WHOO call that was much closer and much louder. This call made us nervous as we both felt it was made by a person who was creeping around our campsite in the dark messing with us. But we had heard no vehicles drive in, saw no headlights or flashlights, and it was too dark and overcast for a person to drive or walk around the woods without a light. My wife has better hearing than I do, and heard what she felt was an answering whoo from some distance away in the forest. Grabbing a flashlight, I walked 75 feet or so back to our vehicle to get my 9mm pistol. There was no question that this wasn’t an owl. The call was much too loud and gave both of us a fearful feeling. I could feel the loudness of the call in my chest. We noticed that our dog had no reaction to the calls, remaining in camp and not acting scared, but I sure felt that way, even with a firearm on my hip. After the last loud call, we didn’t hear anything more the rest of the night. No vehicles drove into the boat launch parking area and we heard no people or animals about. In the morning, I looked around our campsite but couldn’t see that anything had been disturbed. Later back at home, my wife researched owl calls online, but couldn’t find anything that sounded like what we heard. Whatever had made those calls around our campsite that night knew we were there and had a lung capacity much larger than an adult human male.",Directions to our campsite are described in the story.,Bonner County,Idaho,Fall,48.73665,-116.8596,10/7/17,65276,Class B,53.73,42.625,31.52,0.59,Mostly cloudy throughout the day.

"Oct 20 6:15 PM Observed 2 big foots walking up the trail that I was hunting on. My father, brother and I were camped at the head of Swampy Draw on Pleasant Valley creek during the cow elk muzzle loader season. Camp location: 16.5 miles N by NW of Dubois Idaho as the crow flies. Camp was at 7,054 ft elevation. General topography is pine covered mountainsides with grassy / mixed alder brush and sage brush valley floors. We had been hunting elk and deer for 5 days and saw lots of deer on the hillside above camp ~ 250 yards away (from range finder) and a few elk. After spending days exploring around the area we decided to hunt the deer right at camp. My father is 83 and walks with a cane so he hunts close to camp. For the evening hunt my father walked up the hill behind camp ~100 yards and my brother positioned himself a few hundred yards along the base of the hillside. I decided to take my atv up swampy draw and sit at the head of it for the evening. That way we would have a fairly large area covered. Swampy Draw has an old logging road right up the middle of it but the access from Pleasant Valley is difficult. I managed to get up the road on my atv leaving camp at 2:30pm as I wanted to be in hunting position early and let the area quiet down way before prime hunting hours. Prior to the evening hunt I explored a skid road that climbed the east side of the draw and hooked north toward camp. The climb disturbed the area so I headed back down to the main logging road then turned up to the head of Swampy Draw and positioned myself for the evening hunt. At 6:15pm I saw 2 figures coming up the trail towards me at approximately 200 yards. I thought it was 2 hunters that were blowing my evening hunt. But as they came into full view I saw that they were black in color. Most hunters in the area have some sort of blaze orange on them or are dressed in camo. These figures were not dressed. They were walking side by side and I suspect they were a male and female pair although the distance was too great to identify sex. I estimate the height of one at approximately 8 foot and the other 7-1/2 foot. I could not see any facial features at my observation distance. My overall impression was that they were incredibly tall and rather slender. As they saw me they turned to my left and disappeared into timbered hill side. As they turned and walked into the timber I saw very long arms, almost to the knees. They swung their arms in fairly long arcs as they walked; much like a human power walker. It was then that I remembered that I had left my 454 Casull pistol in camp and only had the single shot 54 cal muzzle loader with me. A over sight I will never duplicate. The whole sighting took approximately 20 seconds. Since the creatures were between myself and camp with only one way out I waited 10 min for them to hopefully clear the area. I put my rifle across my lap and headed back to camp. Distance to camp was only a bit over a half mile. Half way to camp I came across a road block on the trail in a small creek that had not been there when I came in. The creatures had picked up a large log and placed it in the creek to block my way. As it was getting dark, with a bit of adrenaline and heavy handed throttle I managed to climb my ATV over the smaller end of the tree. The next day I went back to the barricade only to find that during the night the creatures had improved on their efforts and completely blocked the trail with additional logs and stumps. The logs that they placed in the trail were too heavy for 3 men to pick up and I could find no evidence of dragging. They were picked up and carried, an enormous feat. To make the story a bit weirder, my father kept talking about a stick fort that some kids must of made about 200 yards from camp at the base of the hill. My brother said it must have been made by some Boy Scouts. But nobody uses the area. I went and found the stick structure and it was clearly evident that it was not man made. The main structural tree was pulled down in an arc and no 3 men would have the strength to perform the task. Masses of sticks were then woven into the frame to produce a hollow area approximately 6 feet by 12 feet. My father said it looked like it had been recently used. I think that the course of events were as follows. I came up the logging road on my ATV, explored the spur road that climbed the hill toward camp and close above the stick structure. I disturbed the creatures and they built the barricade. Then they came up the road and showed themselves to me as if to say – Hey here we are and you should not be. I never went past the barricade again. I looked very closely for foot prints but could not find any clear prints in the hard gravelly ground. Of note: The evening of the sighting my brother and father counted over 30 deer on the hillside in the area of the structure. After my sighting we saw no more deer during the 4 days we continued hunting. Also during the night I heard my horse trailer tack door open and shut which I thought was odd. I stored the camp food in the tack room and nothing was missing. I know I had the door tightly shut in case of the odd bear wandering into camp. It takes fingers to work the latch and the door was not latched when I found it in the morning. A bit about me: I am 62 years old and have spent a lifetime hunting and fishing in the wilds. Mostly Montana, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon, Alaska and Northern Minnesota. I have had other what I believe were close encounters but this is the only time I have clearly observed the creatures. Seeing is believing, the debate for me is over.",Camp location: 16.5 miles N by NW of Dubois Idaho as the crow flies.,Clark County,Idaho,Fall,44.41131,-112.2873,10/20/15,50124,Class A,45.16,37.375,29.59,0.25,Light rain in the morning.
"I was archery hunting in Idaho not far from Headquarters Idaho, actually between Township Saddle and Township butte, when I encountered something that I have never experienced before in the mountains. I heard something heavy running ahead of me to my left as I was walking up on old railroad grade that has been used by 4-wheelers. My first impression was it may have been an elk, but I didn't see what was making the sound. I had walked about 1/4 mile from my partner and was closing in on an area where we had seen elk earlier in the week and thought I would try to push ahead to get into the area I had seen the elk. I was walking very quietly when I heard a sound that I thought was a bird flying overhead. I looked up since the sound came from in front of me, when I heard something hit a tree and then the ground behind me. As I turned around, I noticed a branch on a small tree behind me that was moving as if something had hit it.  Before I could walk back to the tree which was only about 15 feet behind me, the branch had stopped moving. There was no wind and it was very calm, and very silent. When I got to the tree, the only think that I found was a large chunk of bark that was laying on the ground. I found this to be unusual since it came off a large tree such as a ponderosa pine as the bark was about 14 inches long, about 6 inches across and about 2 1/2 inches thick. This area has been logged in the last 40 years and there were no trees in the area with a girth which would have produced bark of this size. At this point, it was getting late in the evening so I decided to head back to the 4-wheeler and my hunting partner. I called him on the radio to see where he was. He said he was waiting for me at the 4-wheeler, still about a 1/4 mile away from me. I found nothing else on the trail which would have produced this sound and was wondering if this could fall into the phenomena of others who have experienced similar situations. I was a bit cautious as I walked back down the trail but heard or seen no other anomalies.",Ridge between Township Saddle and Township Butte,Clearwater County,Idaho,Fall,46.75905,-115.8545,11/8/21,61107,Class B,44.01,37.26,30.51,0.17,Clear throughout the day.
"I teach in the city of Galesburg, Knox County Illinois in the summer months.  It was late July or early August when I saw this animal run in front of my car.  It was dusk when my daughter and I were driving on what is known as Old highway 34 (Illinois Route 164) west of Galesburg, Illinois heading for Monmouth, Illinois. I was right by the Knox / Warren county line. I had just driven over a little bridge that covered a small creek or farm run off.  This bridge was down in a little lower area then the rest of the land and as I came over the bridge and started around a little curve an animal ran in front of my car.  It was about 15 yards in front of my vehicle.  Since it was not quite dark, my headlights did not illuminate the animal well, yet it was still light enough to see the creature.  The creature was very dark and hairy it was running on all fours, yet it was very tall.  Its rear end was up higher than its front end and it appeared to have no muzzle.  Its face was flat. This creature had a most awkward gate for the speed it was actually achieving.  Its front legs moved as if a human would be leaning over a tricycle peddling and its back legs moved with a human running motion including what appeared to be knees. My daughter, unfortunately did not see it and that was very disappointing for her and me. The animal ran so quickly across the road that by the time I was able to say something it was gone.  We turned around to see if we could see it off the side of the road but in Illinois that time of the year it's impossible.

"We happened to notice a large complete footprint under an apple tree in our backyard measuring about 18"".  We live at the edge of a subdivision that backs up to a deeply wooded stream that eventually leads to a large man-made lake. Our lot is rather extensive and towards to back we have several varieties of fruit trees including apples, peaches, nectarines, cherries, and pears. The foot print was found under the most mature and biggest of apple trees with a level muddy area under it amongst a sloping yard that leads to the stream. Coincidentally, the area on the apple tree directly above the print was devoid of apples while the remainder of the tree was more abundant with fruit.  We've also noticed in years past that we see fruit growing on all of our trees but by the time it's near maturity it all disappears. We just figured it was raccoons but apparently not. Our next-door neighbor has a cuddly german-shephard who roams leash-free around his yard but rarely comes into our yard unless accompanied by our neighbor. After we showed the neighbor the footprint, he told us that his dog darted out in the backyard one night then immediately came running back and cowered near his owner for the remainder of the night. Ever since he is leery to roam the yard and has even been sleeping in his owners bed, which he never did before. Our neighbor also reported hearing high-pitched catlike shrieking noises in the last few weeks. After the discovery of the footprint we discovered a decapitated rabbit.  The head was completely torn clean away from the body as if it had been ""popped"" off.  It wasn't shredded or otherwise bloody, just simply guillotined.  We've recently learned this could have been a gift from our large-footed visitor as appreciation for munching on our fruit.",,Sangamon County,Illinois,Spring,39.66676,-89.68079,6/15/11,29495,Class B,78.89,69.75,60.61,0.5,Rain in the morning.

"I was just outside and my 3 yearold lab was spooked by somethig like I've never seen. Barking--in a fear sound-- and running in circles! Wind is in the west and that is the direction of her concern. Only other time I've seen this was 2 years ago when she was spooked smelling the air. I could smell it too. It was like the worst locker room smell mixed with road kill. It took her 3-4 days to settle down. Tom The witness first contacted the BFRO with this report on June 23, 2011. On July 19, 2011, I met with him at his house. I interviewed the witness that day and had him explain what types of things he had been experiencing. Since then, this location has been the site of an on-going investigation with a long-term audio recorder left in the woods near his house. I interviewed the witness again in late October 2011, and the content of the two interviews follows: The first name of the witness has been changed. Stan - When was the first time something happened that you didn’t understand. Tom – It was a year ago, so it was probably early June of 2010. It was a Saturday, a friend had stopped by. When I am outside my dog Lulu roams the property, sometimes she will go back into the tree-line but she usually stays close to me. At one o’clock in the afternoon we were in the shop talking and doing stuff. When he was getting ready to leave I called for her. She was real nervous, her tail was tucked. There was a light breeze from the south and she was facing towards the south and acting very unusual. Tom - I figured it was a deer, a coyote, something back there. I walked back a little ways and she wouldn’t move, she just stayed here by the side door, very nervous. I finally said, let’s go in. My friend had left. I opened the door and had to raise my voice to get her to come in, which was unusual because she always wants to stay right near me. So I raised my voice and she came in and she ran straight down the steps into the basement and hid. I first thought when she went down that she was looking for a toy or something. After ten minutes I went down and found her, she was hiding behind the furniture in an unused room, cowering, and I reached down and she wouldn’t come to me. I reached down to touch her and she was shaking. Tom - I made her come back up for awhile and then we went back outside and repeated the same thing five or six times to about  8 o’clock that night. We had Lady Asian bugs and I am apparently sinus sensitive to them and that night around 9 o’clock I got my sinuses cleared up and we stepped out that side door, still had a breeze from the south, and she instantly panicked and went into that cowering motion, still shaking and standing low, not up like a dog does. Tom - I stood there and thought about it for a little bit and got a good whiff of it. The best description I have is that it was like the worst locker room stench or sweaty clothes that sat in a hamper for two weeks mixed with maybe road kill, bloody violent. It stood the hair up on my back. I sat back and thought wow, the trees are two hundred feet away, what is back there that smells so bad. And at the time she laid down in the yard, facing the south and was real nervous. She would look over her should behind her and then she would get up and face the other way because the wind currents were changing and she kept doing that. So we went back in for the night. Tom - Next morning I got up and went to church and breakfast, came home, got dressed and walked back in there. She walked with for a ways and then she turned and ran back up here to the house. Tom – From that time on there have been few deer and coyotes around. Prior to that I could see deer most every morning out back or down the roads. I think I have only seen one deer on my property in a year. Last night was the second time I’ve heard coyotes in a year. And usually if I grilled chicken out they would be howling, they would smell it and they’d be singing. Stan – After that initial time did you smell it again last year? Tom – I never noticed it again. About a week before, my nephew called and said there are footprints in a subdivision south of Chatham. I said that bugs me because a few days ago she (Lulu) was out back behind the brown shed barking in defense and I stepped out to see what she was doing. She had her nose up, she was following the wind currents I think, because she was running in circles, tail was tucked and she was real nervous. And I called her and she looked towards me, like she was ready to come to me and then she would jump like something spooked her, an animal, like you through a rock at her.  She did that for a couple of days when we were out. It was in the west that time and she was facing west. Stan – Have you ever felt like you were being watched? Tom –  Yes, just about every time I see her doing something like that, a few times I’ve been outside, I get that feeling. Stan – Have you ever had anything thrown at you, like rocks or anything. Tom – No. Stan – What about sounds? Tom – Last night, it was probably after 10, I think it was 10:30 or so I had been watching TV and I noticed she was restless in the house. I asked her once “Do you have to go potty?” Usually she would come up to me and she would give me a “Ruff” and we would go. She wouldn’t do that last night, she just looked at me like “keep guessing”. About 10:30 I said “Come on let’s go potty and then we’ll go to bed. We stepped outside and she immediately faced south and froze and I got the feeling while she was doing that that somebody was starring at me. Tom – So I stepped back in, grabbed my cellphone and my big spotlight and she was still outside. I stepped outside and started walking south towards the treeline, but she stayed right by that door. Now normally a dog will follow its master, and I got about half way between the pool and the treeline and stopped and stood there a little bit. And I could hear (it was real quiet you could hear crickets) stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp. My hair stood up, I thought “What in the world is walking in twigs and branches?” And I said “Who’s there?” and I stopped, and I’m thinking “a couple of my friends know and are they pulling a prank?” And then I think I said it again “Who’s there?” like that. Tom – And I waited and there was a “Whoo-oo” sound like that came back at me, probably not that loud because it knew I could hear it whatever it was. Right after that, west of here, and I would say a good half mile coyotes started screaming and yelling. Now, I don’t need to be out here alone, I don’t have a gun, I don’t have a knife. My dog was spooked, she was staying up at the house. So, I came back in, started turning the light off, fifteen, twenty minutes passed. Tom – I have a little sound amplifier and headset and you can adjust the volume. I went quietly out onto the deck, left her inside, and I sat for fifteen or twenty minutes listening. I could hear some footsteps same interval steps that was west of me now back in the trees. I said “There is something back there, but I’m not going to go look after dark not when it’s something powerful. Tom – Anyway when I came in from that I went to check email and Facebook was up with the link for Chatham for the story they just published in the paper about footprints and Messing With Sasquatch. Stan – So did you hear any other vocals. Tom – After I heard the footsteps and I called out and it made the sound back I started walking back up to the house. I heard what sounded like children playing and they weren’t very far away, like a couple of little girls giggling or talking. Now there are no kids back there, I know there can’t be. The next house is a half mile down the road or so. My dog Lu, started out to me and I said “Who is that?” and she froze and came right back to the house when she heard it again. Stan – So it sounded like kids playing? Tom – Like little girls talking or playing. Stan – No crying, more as a conversation? Tom – I don’t know how I would describe it, it wasn’t understandable, it wasn’t “I want that toy.” It was a whining, high pitched voice like a little girls would be. Stan – Thank you for allowing me to interview you Tom. Tom – You are welcome Stan. On Sunday, October 23, 2011, the witness had an unusual experience at his home and the next morning found a large footprint outside his living room window. He took pictures with a tape measure along the footprint. Tom was also able to see all the toes in the loose dirt. But it's always difficult for photographs of footprints to show very much detail. My interview with Tom concerning this incident follows: Tom – I have an L-shaped couch and I am sitting on one end of it, the other end is under a window, and that window is on the east side of my house. We are watching the World Series, it was probably around 9:30 and Lulu, my dog, raised her head and then looked at me with big eyes like “Did you hear that?” And then she turns and looks at the window and I go “Yeah, I heard it.” And I said “Go ahead and get down.” So she got down, came out on the floor and laid down so she could watch the window. Tom – And we heard the noise several more times, and she got up wandered around the house and smelled floor, and walls and was just nervous. Tom – Then the next morning we went outside and there was a footprint out there. Now let me back up a little bit, Friday I pulled some rose bushes and raked the landscaping right there next to the house, so it was all fresh. So, that footprint happened I believe Sunday night. Now this scenario where she is on the couch and we hear this noise, this has happened seven or eight different times this summer. Stan – Can you describe the sound. Tom – It just sounds like a creak, like somebody is leaning against the wall on the outside. And I’ve got vertical blinds and they’re turned to block the light where I am sitting but when you are outside you can look and see the TV if you are tall. I can’t see the TV when I am outside. I am six foot tall. So for someone to look in that window has to be more than six foot tall. Right footprint found the 24th of October 2011 showing a length of 14 inches. Stan – I know you had a ruler next to the footprint, how long did you think it was? Tom – It is 14 inches long. Stan – And the width was? Tom – 7 inches wide. And the footprint is curved, it almost looks like a broken foot or something, I don’t know how to describe it, but it’s not straight like ours. Where ours has an arch this looks like the footprint is curved. Stan – Thank you for allowing me to interview you Tom. Tom – You are welcome Stan.

"[Witness first names have been changed] On Tuesday evening June 28, 2011, I along with fellow paranormal investigator James arrived at the Cumberland Sugar Creek Cemetery in rural Sangamon County near the small town of Glenarm, Illinois a little before 10:00pm. James and I are both paranormal investigators and had previously talked about trying to find the cemetery to check it out for a possible paranormal investigation. Upon finding the location, we decided to do a quick walk through of the cemetery to see if anything of a paranormal nature was occurring and to check out the cemetery's layout. We also had heard from other local paranormal sources that a group of paranormal investigators had been pelted with rocks or dirt clods thrown from the tree line around the cemetery. This occurred less than one week ago and during a paranormal investigation. We had also heard of several recent sightings of large tracks or foot prints in the Covered Bridge area of rural Sangamon County which is not far from the cemetery. James and I both felt that the throwing of stones sounded like classic Squatch activity and because of this we decided to check the tree line around the cemetery to look for possible signs of what may have been throwing the stones at the paranormal group. This is when we found the following. In the Southeast corner of the cemetery property and next to an opening in the fence line, we found a mound of fairly soft clay. As we were looking around the mound of dirt, we noticed what looked like a fairly large foot print. Upon further examining the foot print, it was apparent that whatever had been walking there was barefoot. In the same proximity we discovered two other footprints which were approximately the same size. We estimated the size of the prints to be at least fourteen inches long. The footprints were also barefoot. The tracks were headed away from the cemetery and towards the southeast. Because we had not planned on doing anything more than a walkthrough of the cemetery we did not have our usual camera and lighting equipment with us, so we took several photos of the footprints with James’ cell phone camera. We also noticed that approximately 75 feet or so and to the North of the footprints a fairly good sized tree of maybe 3 to 4 inches in circumference had been snapped and bent over. The tree was located next to but outside of the fence. The area surrounding the cemetery is rural, the cemetery itself has a fence around the rear part of the graveyard however the best that we could tell in the darkness is that it looked like there was an open field to the rear of the cemetery and it appeared that on the other side of the open field there may be more substantial tree coverage. But unfortunately due to the darkness and lack of lighting equipment, we could not determine any further details of the surrounding terrain. We then left the cemetery around 11:00pm.",Two miles west of Glenarm.,Sangamon County,Illinois,Summer,39.62,-89.6845,6/28/11,32634,Class B,81.53,69.87,58.21,0.91,Clear throughout the day.
"I was driving on Veterans Parkway in Springfield. Heading north at 60 mph. There is a heavly wooded area with a pond in the area also. It is a four lane highway with two lanes going south and two going north divided by a grassy medium. It was 2 a.m. and I was the only vehicle on the road, nothing else in sight. Then about 200 yards ahead of me I noticed something moving across the two southbound lanes. At first I thought it was a deer, since I see them frequently. So I hit my bright lights and saw it was something bigger than a deer. At my speed of 60 mph, no way it should have been gone when I reached the area where it crossed the road. It seemed to move effortlessly cross the road, in only a few strides. I was in amazement not knowing what it was. I know for a fact  it wasnt a deer. And this is not bear country, it wasn't a horse or a dog, wolf, coyote or any other animal familiar to this area. Then I wondered if it could have been the elusive BIG-FOOT. When I saw it I hit my bright lights, it had two legs and it was hunched over like it had long arms draggin right above the road. It moved so fast, not like a human or an animal and I've seen animals cross the road but this was big steps. Where I saw it, the area is very damp and has lots of deer. Its close to the water and sewer treatment. And if you know the area you know the foul smell. Good for a bigfoot. I wish I could have been more ready for it but I was like stunned.

I look for deer all the time when I drive anywhere. I was on my way home after school from LLCC. On the UIS soccer fields there was something at the edge of the field at the tree line. I glanced away and back and it was gone. It was a human shape but the shape from the head to the body was flowing with long hair all over. It was about 8 feet tall brown in color but was in the shade of the trees.

"On September 16, 2017 I left work early. I clocked out around 4:45 a.m., yes a.m. I was driving on Rochester Road getting close to the stoplight at Oak Hill Road when from the left side of the road a two legged creature ran across the road in front of me. It was still dark out and I had my lights on, the creature was just at the end of where my lights hit. It didn't seem to be extremely tall, but what caught my eye was the huge muscles on its legs and arms. It didn't appear to have much of a neck, like the head was sitting on the shoulders. I could see that it was not wearing any clothes, but also did not see long hair either. I would estimate it to be between 6'-6'5"". It was a dark dirty black/grey color.

I looked over in the direction of that scream and saw something black as far as I could see and then it just disappeared.

I'm a retired paranormal and cryptid researcher and I had a personal encounter this year while deer hunting in Shelby County Illinois which is considered south central Illinois. I will not disclose the exact location but I will say it happened in a very well known state park. I had two encounters in two days one after another. The first was a grey color and second one was a dark black color. The second encounter I got a series of pics that aren't the best but show a dark figure walking away. I have the details all recorded and theories as to why in the area that I have seen these creatures. I am also a well known tracker and guide in the area and I know my wildlife very well.

"I am an avid outdoorsman and bow hunter in southern Illinois. I have hunted all over the U.S. seeing many animals and all kinds of terrain, but this day was not like any other I have ever had. I was heading to some public land that adjoins to the river to river trail. I drove between two orchard fields to get there I have hunted this spot many times I have seen numerous mountain lions, bobcats coyotes etc. in this location. I unloaded my gear and set off to a part of the public land rarely visited by people. If not for me I doubt anyone would ever go back to the spot. It was right around 1130 am I had been walking approximately 30-45 mins into the woods. I came to around 900 yards from my spot, it was pretty open the leaves had fallen off the trees and I could see a good distance. I started walking and I heard a snap of a branch other then mine. I believed it to be a deer so I stopped behind a big white oak tree in which I was behind and leaned against it. I went to peer around it and I couldn't believe my eyes, it's like nothing I have ever seen before. I was approximately 78 yards away according to my range finder I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me as to what I had seen it was gray with a slight bit of tan and brown mixed into its coat. It looked to be around 4 n a half to 5 feet tall. It did stand on two legs. But I believe it smelled me when the wind picked up and blew towards it an it dropped very, very low to the ground. lower then a bear could go and I ducked back behind the tree. When I looked back from behind the tree it was gone.

"It all began with my father in law. He had an encounter of something huge and making an un familiar noise he said he had never heard before. He is a 70 year old man and great guy. I recall laughing and making fun of him. Then the tables turned, I was in the woods alone hunting in the 2015 hunting season.I was in my stand and had several deer come in but they seemed very skidish. I drew my crossbow down on a nice buck and pulled the trigger. My arrow seemed to find its mark. I allowed about 45 minutes to go by and it began getting dark. As I climbed down out of my stand I began hearing some unusual noises. Kind of like I screaming growling noise. Now I'm soon to be 50 years old myself and as my father in law said to me. These were sounds that I had never heard before in the woods or anywhere else. I called my father in law and told him I had a deer down and asked if he could meet me out in the woods to help me get the deer out. He told me he was in Terre Haute Indiana, and that it would be close to an hour before he could even get home. I was too embarrassed to tell him I too was feeling pretty uneasy. I tried to keep him on the phone but he had to get off the phone.so I began tracking the deer I found really good blood. And was sure the deer didn't go far. As I started down a small hill I began hearing these noises again. It was as if I could feel these screaming growling noises in my body. I kept hearing what I thought may have been falling tree branches or something. I looked up on this hill side 30 yards from me and seen a sillhouette of something huge. I quickly headed out of the woods and continued hearing the noises all the way out. I called my father in law and told him about my encounter. He laughed and said you mad fun of me. We returned the next morning to find the blood trail  where I left off and we knew the deer had to be close due to the amount of blood. And then it was as if the deer just vanished.. We began working in circles to find nothing. There was a steep cliff to the east of where we found the last blood. We looked down torward the creek to find nothing. But the smell in the woods was as it was the night before. A very strong pungent odor. Kind of a cross of something dead and the urine of many different types of animals. I felt eyes on us the whole time we were out there. We went back several times without success. Then in April I went out to the same location mushroom hunting, I found that the woods was  very quiet. I didn't find any mushrooms so I headed out through the North end of the woods to look at deer sign. When it hit me, the smell it was so strong , I began hurrying to get out of the woods as I got to the edge of the woods to an area we call the  grassy area and there it was a foot print. A single foot print it was the left foot and was very large . The print was a good one very detailed you could see the toes and everything.I wear a size 13 and this print was way bigger than my foot. This area is about three miles from the Kickapoo state park in Vermilion county Illinois. I have never been frightened in the woods in all my life.

"I reported a sighting a while back.  I went to Beall Woods State Park, it was summer but getting near fall. I took my dog out for a walk for the first time ever, as we got to the very first fork in the trails my dog became very scared like he smelled something but I couldn't. So I took the plum tree trail which goes off to the right and next to a very large ravine. As I got closer to the spill way of it my dog would not move as he was looking at something at the bottom of the ravine. I watched for about thirty seconds and then it moved. It was  tall and lean like a track runner. As he turned he saw me, no sound but just wide eyed and opened mouthed. As I backed up he took two steps toward me, that is when my dog barked a very forceful bark that then it stopped and took a step back as I got farther back. I turned and walked very gingerly out of there. As I did i could hear it climb the wall of the ravine in like two steps then through the woods.

It is early November still leaves on the tree but some have fallen so I could still see thru the woods somewhat. I dont remember the exact time of day but it was early evening several hours before sunset.

I was starting to start to get down from my stand to see what the person was doing on private land. Off to my right (north) I hear something walking in the large ravine at this point the figure was about 60 yards heading west up the ravine.

I personally did not have an incident but my Aunt and Grandmother did.   I am not certain the year.  My aunt was a young girl and she is in her late 70's now. My grandparents bought a cabin for a weekend get away.  This cabin was very remote.  It was near Eldorado and the area was called Sandy Run.   There were 4 cabins on a lake surrounded by woods.  Very remote. My aunt and my mother were sleeping in the front room.  My aunt awoken in the middle of the night when she heard the front screen door on the enclosed porch open.  She heard footsteps.  There were 3 front windows and a door looking out onto the porch.   She saw a large man-like figure walk past all three windows and stop at the door.  The figure bent down to look in.  She said it looked like a very large man covered in red hair and had a pointed head.   She was afraid and ran and got into bed with my grandparents.  And never spoke of it until years later. I have been listening to this story (only when I ask her to retell it for many years).  She has never deviated from the story. Ever.  My aunt would not lie to me. As I was a young girl.  My grandmother told me she was at the cabin alone in mid day.  She looked out the back and saw a large ape looking creature on the cliff and descending down the cliff like no human ever would be able to.   She told me that story once and I will never forget her conviction about it.   My grandmother would have no reason to lie to me either.   My grandmother has passed but my aunt is still living. After these stories I have become a major bigfoot enthusiast.  Everyone I know thinks I'm a nut.  But there is no doubt in my mind what my grandmother and aunt saw.

"The BF I saw was honey brown in color and I witnessed it bang large rocks together. I didn't see its face, its hair was in the way. It was standing sideways. This happened on a farm south of Rock Falls, Illinois. November-2006. It happened in a cornfield, with a large pine grove, along with brush and some trees. This particular part of the farm was in an area where they dumped their cows and calves, that had died while giving birth.  (its illegal but many do it because it cost a lot of money to dispose) they also dumped the carcasses of the deer from hunting, after they butchered them.  I didn't smell the BF, but I'm pretty sure my German Shepard did.  I was out there to walk her, like many times I had done in the past.  But this time she took off. I tried to call her back, but she had a funny/scared look in her face.  I thought that was strange, but blew it off, and kept walking on a little bit more. That was until I looked up and saw it. I looked at my friend, to say ""hey did you see that"", but he was looking down at the field/ ground. I looked back, and it was gone. I was in shock, trying to rationalize what I had just seen.

"The following incidents occurred between the years 1984 and 1986 around our woods which is located just south of the intersection of E300 N Rd 300 and county road 1425 Northwest of Atwood Illinois. At the time we lived in the 15 acre woods which is at that location. The Lake fork river runs just behind that woods and there is a bottom land just north of the woods which floods every fall. At the time I was a teenager and hunted, fished and trapped along a several mile stretch of that river. The encounters we had were not visual. The first instance was about 10pm on a winter evening when I was going to let our poodle out before turning in for the night. There was only what I could describe as a combination of a Scream/howl which came from just on the North side of the house. Our dog was so frightened it would not go out of the door. He was not afraid of anything and to see that fear in him was shocking. The volume of the howl was immense. My mother was home and heard it as well. Even from inside a well insulated Illinois home it sounded as if it was right next to you. I had the door open and it felt like I had been hit in the chest by the sound. The second instance was just south of that woods about a half mile down from where the river bends. I was returning from hunting about 5pm in the evening and heard the exact same howl. It came from the smaller wood which is right next to the river just south of our woods. The 3rd instance was a series of footprints along the bank of the lake fork river. Just to the west of the road intersection mentioned above, the lake fork passes under a bridge. Just south of that bridge the river bends and flows east. I was fishing along that bend on a spring day about 10 in the morning. I felt that there was something not right and then realized that there were no animal sounds. Typically there are all sorts of sparrows and red winged black birds, but there was nothing. I looked down as I was walking and noticed that I was walking next to a line of footprints in the mud. I wore mens size 12 hiking boots and these prints were 5 toed and 2"" wider and 3"" longer than my boots. They were very fresh with dirt still loose on the edge of the track. I looked up and down the river but did not see a thing. The river banks in that area are steep with tall grass. The forth instance was while deer hunting on the east side of the large woods just to the north east of that bridge. I had gone out bow hunting and had set up a blind on the east side of the woods. I had walked from our house and was set up in a blind in full camo by 45mins prior to sunrise. Just before light I heard the same howl which I estimated came from about 50 yards away to my north. It was so powerful that it shook me. I waited for several minutes and it howled again. Only having a bow and not a gun I literally walked backwards the few hundred yards back to the county road with an arrow knocked and ready to go. Not that it would have done any good. You could tell by the volume of the scream/howl that this was a very very large creature. The 5th instance was around 10:30 at night in the back of our house. We kept a large horse tank in the back where we would dump and burn trash. It was approximately 35 yards behind the house. I was taking the trash out and had just dumped it when I heard a ""Hmph"" from the edge of the tree line which was about 10 yards away. I head another ""Hmph"" and then something large taking off down the side of the hill towords the bottom land, I headed quickly in the house. The next morning I checked the area and could see the same size prints mentioned above. I couldn't see them clearly as before due to thick ground cover of leaves. The Howls around our house were heard by my mother. I do not know of any other people in the area having the same instances. at the time there were only 4 families living in that area.

It was probably 9pm or so. What ever it was just stopped and stood there. Then it went back into the woods fast. Mom ran back inside the house with me by the wrist.

"To be honest, I’m very reluctant to submit this report but the pictures and details are simply too compelling to ignore. Two months ago my wife and I purchased five acres of rural, wooded property here in Massac County, Illinois.  I mow approximately two acres of this ground, with the rest of it being heavily wooded. I know nothing about Botany, so I can’t describe the vegetation on the property outside of an Oak and/or Silver Maple trees. Just take my word for it – it’s thick with trees and underbrush. On May 3rd at 6:15p.m., my wife, myself, and my two boys sons went out to this new property to have a picnic at the cabin. I was half-way down the hill toward the cabin when my wife yelled, “Oh my gosh! Look at this - look at this!” She was up the slope close to our parked trucks, staring at the ground. I walked back up to her position and she was staring at this print on the ground (pictures attached).  I had, evidently, walked right over the track without noticing. I then searched the radial area around the track and found two more partial impressions.  Growing more suspicious caused me to search the “bottoms” behind the cabin.  I found a strange tree structure and photographed that, as well. Listen, I’ve got a BS in Management Communication and am pursuing a Masters in Theology. I am also a local minister, so my credibility is at stake. I would never consider fabricating a story, much less a story like this one. Now, we’ve got to use a little critical thinking, but this is where logic and reality seem to be in opposition.  What makes a print like the one we’ve found on our property?  There’s two plausible possibilities; (1) A very large, very heavy man or woman – with a 14+ inch foot - is walking around out in the cool spring air with no shoes, trespassing on private property, out in a rural part of the country, risking arrest or a bullet. Or (2), ? I asked a good friend of mine, and member of the church, to take photos of the print using his 10 mega-pixal camera – the photos are truly incredible.

I was sitting at a picnic table eating pizza. I notice four kids running back and forth on a trail.

However it was stocky and I could see dark tanish colored skin threw its hair. Shortly after the kids returned on the trail.

And it was tall, I would say maybe 7-7and a half feet tall and muscular. It wasn't huge but very tall, but muscular. Like a younger one. That's why I call him the youngster. He's curious. Anyway he hit the pool with his right hand as he was heading towards the only set of tree's around. Which is my neighbors to the north of me. i went up stairs in my son's bathroom to look out the window and he must of saw me and didn't like me watching him because he threw something at the house, so I stopped watching him.He was a darker color, I would say almost black but a little lighter. I don't think he thought anybody should be awake at that time in the morning. Because it seems almost like I not scared him but we both did not expect to see each other that a.m.","It happened on my street in Lake in the Hills. At my house.

"I was walking down my street and heard what sounded like a guy off in the cornfield yelling, approximately 600 feet away. It was sort of a grunting yell, very deep and it echoed through the neighborhood.  It sent the hair up on my neck and scared me a little because the only thing between me and the yelling was a row of houses. This is not the first time I've heard what I think might be a Bigfoot in the area. I have heard what seemed to be three of them sort of locating each other the week before Thanksgiving.  Again, I was out walking late at night in my neighborhood, around midnight.  I heard a fox call at the end of my block but that sound was cut off by what sounded like a woman trying to imitate her from a little further away. Then a few seconds later, a ""man"" let out a yell about 3 blocks away.  This yell was a deep guttural long yell, too long to be a human.  It made the hair on my neck stand up and it also echoed through the neighborhood.  Not a few seconds later, a faint ""howl"" came from what sounded like across the lake.  By this point, I had gotten back to my porch and entered the house to find all three of my cats wide eyed and standing in the middle of my living room.  Out of curiosity, I decided to go sit on my porch to see if the howls continued. The sequence of howls and yells continued on for about 20 minutes. First the ""woman"", then the ""man"", then the faint one across the lake until they were far enough away that loud vehicles drowned them out and I went back inside.  I wish I'd have thought to use my cellphone camera to record it.","I was walking westbound on Hiawatha at 2:55am.  The row of houses is on my right, north and the cornfield is just behind the row of houses.  It sounded as though the howls were going north through the cornfield.  When I reached my front door I decided to just go in and not hang around to see if it was coming back my direction.  I was 3 or 4 houses east of mine when the howls started.

"I will try to make this short. I live in Illinois in a rural area, my house is set in the woods and seeing wildlife from the kitchen window is pretty standard. Its middle winter and the visibility into the woods is much better than summer. Anyway its not uncommon to get glimpses of deer running through the woods farther back in the woods at this time of year with the better visibility , although its just that glimpses. So a few days ago in the middle of the day I witnessed some deer running at a rapid pace back in the woods I wasnt able to get a good look at them , but they were running fast , like I said the visibility wasnt great , but I saw what I thought was a larger upright looking animal chasing behind the deer. I jokingly said to my mom who was trying to see what i was watching ""its a bigfoot"" not really believing that I got a  good enough look to concur it was anything. Then today my mom told me she was walking the dog in the woods and found a huge piece of poop with fur in it... I just wanted to pass this info along to you incase it interest you .. I live in gran detour illinois , I searched some sites and in the 70's there were casting of footprints made in the area...contact me with any questions",,Ogle County,Illinois,Winter,41.90703,-89.41539,2/28/10,27387,Class B,37.69,34.145,30.6,0.51,Overcast throughout the day.
"Well, I went out hunting with my Lab, I got a full-blooded Lab, my dog. And as usual I went out on a Wednesday. It was a nice sunny day out, nice weather, around 72 degrees, 75 degrees, very good weather. I drove back into the area where I've been hunting every year for the last 20 years. And that's when I had an experience. The dog kept acting up. And I also noticed a kind of a stench smell and I thought maybe it was something dead. And I kept hearing something of more of like a grunt noise. So I kept hearing that and as I heard that I thought maybe somebody was playing jokes or something on me or playing a prank but then I realized there was nobody else I knew out there, there weren't any other vehicles so I went ahead and started looking around  for mushrooms. I walked maybe less than ten feet and I heard a few more grunt noises toward me and they seemed like they weren't that far off, I had that feeling that someone was watching me and as I stood there I heard it went from a grunt to, oh I would say, a loud more of a scream or yell. I have never heard nothing like that in my life before. And it proceeded twice after it did it the first time it did it again a few seconds later and then I heard three like movements in the trees, like cracking and the brush was moving and lo and behold here comes my Lab running back, with the hair all the way up from her neck and all the way down to her tail, and her tail all the way between her legs and her head down and she was looking towards the area where I had heard the noise. The dog was scared, I have never seen my dog ever act like that. That is when it kind of scared me because I thought if the dog is that scared what is it? Well then I ended up getting in the vehicle, it scared me and I still had that feeling I was being watched. I got in the vehicle and backed my truck all the way up the road that is along side a corn and soybean field I backed up and proceeded towards the back entrance where I came in and I parked it almost mile from where I was actually at when I had these experiences and I went on the opposite side of the corn field. As I went over there I thought I will hunt over here, it seems like it is more open, a lot of thickets and brush but not as thick as where I was at and it was quite away off and there was still plenty of daylight, sunshine. When I got out and walked down in there I looked across the creek and the water was probably no more than four or five inches deep. And there isn't really a lot traffic over there and when I walked I couldn't believe my eyes I seen footprints, actual footprints, and I knew it couldn't be human, a human wouldn't have walked in that area barefoot, for one there is too many thickets and he would have been crazy if he did and two it was so big Shaq couldn't have a foot that big. The first one I found was the right foot and the big toe you could see it very clear, and the other one was four feet away and it was the left foot. On it you could see the heel and the toes. Basically after that I came the next day. My son-in-law, who is an ex-police officer, wanted to go out. He was a non-believer and a skeptic and basically didn't believe me. He wanted me to prove to him I wasn't lying. So I said, ""I'll let you be the judge, maybe I'm making a mistake, maybe I didn't see what I seen."" We went out the next day and found other tracks that were in the same area from where I found the first set of tracks. So instead of finding two sets of footprints we found like six of them. They were all scattered in an area within fifty yards along the creek. That was on May 6th, which was a Thursday.",,Peoria County,Illinois,Spring,40.82944,-89.73378,5/5/10,27692,Class B,73.23,59.785,46.34,0.74,Partly cloudy in the morning.
"On August 14, 2011, I was walking through heavily wooded area and decided to walk along creek bed. I came upon what looked like a very large footprint. I could clearly see the entire outline of the foot, as well as 5 distinct toe prints. I did not have measuring tape but l took pictures and measured with pack of gum and a cigarette pack. If I have to guess the length and width I would say at least 17 inches long and at least 7 inches wide. Had seen couple other prints on hillside but could not capture image well on my camera. Shortly after I finished studying print and wondering what made it, I continued walking creek bottom. I heard movement and large branch being twisted. At that time I decided to get out of the woods.

I have saw what I would call a big foot three times. The first time it was in the fall of 2010. It was late at night. I woke up by my dogs barking. I got up to see what was going on. Thru the screen door I could see a large dark figure walking across my pasture going to my barn. I went back to my bed room and got a gun. I stepped out the door. The creature was a few feet from my barn and I noticed its head was level with the bottom of the roof of my barn. It was very large.  I fired one shot in the air to try to scare it off. It didn't phase it. I then opened fire. It took off running across the pasture running thru 3 strands of wire. One of my dogs took off after it and I followed. I shot 14 40 cal. bullets toward this creature and it didn't slow it down. It disappeared into the corn behind my house. I had goats in the barn. Twice in the fall of 2011 I saw it walking across the field once in the field behind my house once in front.

"To protect the confidentiality of the witness the witness names have been changed. Stan Courtney is familiar with this story since he spoke to both Mary and myself about what Mary and her husband saw. Mary lives in Algonquin, Kane County, east of the Fox River and her property backs right up against the Illinois Prairie Path, a one time railway.  This path goes from McHenry to Aurora, as far as I know.  Stan has a picture of this path that I sent to him. Mary has given me permission to write this report.  She is in pre-nursing and busy with school and hesitant to write this report herself so she asked me to write it, our mutual friend Sarah was witness to this verbal permission. What Mary and her husband saw: It was Thursday morning February 3, 2011, the blizzard had finally stopped dumping some 3 to 4 feet of snow with drifts much higher.  Mary had a snow day off from school.  She gets up and her husband immediately starts to joke with her about having to use the outhouse located in their back yard. This plastic outhouse was left over from a big party held many years before and it was never picked up by the company, so it sits there and is used sometimes during the summer.  So he was kidding her about having to use this outhouse so bad and during the worst blizzard in many, many years. She asked why was he saying that?  He said to take a look at the tracks someone left going through their back yard, starting at their patio on the side of the unattached garage, then heading south going towards the outhouse and then continuing on to the point that the tracks could not be seen anymore.  They do have a chain link fence that spans the whole width of the back yard along the path.  It seemed strange that ANYONE would be out walking in that blizzard and especially crossing their yard, very strange but they thought nothing more of it. They eventually went outside and dug themselves out of big drifts up against the house and opening up a sidewalk that leads from the back door to the unattached garage...giving the tracks no further thoughts. Now its March and Mary and Sarah and myself are having our usual Saturday morning breakfast.  I was telling them about the BFRO site and of the pictures of bigfoot tracks in the snow following deer tracks.  Well, Mary's eyes got real big and she said ""Oh my gosh, so thats what those track were"".  Of course, we encouraged her to tell us her story. A few weeks later Sarah and I went to Mary's house after breakfast and took some pictures.  By now the snow is all gone but we were able to see the outhouse and its relationship to the patio.  We did notice that the chain link fence was pushed down but that did not look like a new happening.  I asked Mary how long has that fence been that way and she did not know...just did not pay attention to it...this part of the fence was in the very south west corner of their lot, well behind the outhouse with lots of trees covering the path itself. At our breakfast as she was telling us her story we tried to think of what animal (besides a human, maybe) could make tracks like that.  There are lots of deer in the area, perhaps some coyote, but we could not think of what or who in their right mind would walk in 3 or 4 foot deep snow, not make any drag marks in the middle of a blizzard?? Mary and her husband did not take any pictures, darn, their minds were just not into thinking about a tall 7-10 foot creature walking down their driveway (which had been plowed) stopping at the edge of the patio, then walking across their yard, head towards the outhouse and then continue on and most likely leaped over the fence and onto the Prairie Path.  It was our theory that perhaps the outhouse had enough of an odor to draw the attention of a sasquatch on its way to somewhere???? I hope I have remembered things correctly...I was really hoping that Mary would do this report herself, but apparently she has some fears on telling the story accurately, I don't know.  As I said Stan has spoken to Mary at length and perhaps can add some more details.",,Kane County,Illinois,Winter,42.1551,-88.2886,2/3/11,29448,Class B,14.78,10.11,5.44,0.03,Clear throughout the day.
"The day was july 2,2011 we decided to go fishing at the kankakee river out in manteno, il. Ive been fishing there for about 10 yrs. just recently about 4 yrs at the new location between the wilmington and momence dam. it was about 11pm  when me and my nephew decided to go and check the lines we had set about 50 yrds or so away from where we had set out chairs and fire. my gf and other nephew stayed behind. this has happened before on past occasions where i have the feeling someone or thing is watching me run my lines at night. i dont make any big fuss about it as i dont want to startle my nephews, or who is with me on that day. this occasion on july 2 2011, i noticed my nephew that was sitting with my girlfriend at the time i was checking lines that he was fueling the fire to get brighter. when we got back he and my gf both said they heard footsteps behind them with brush moving. i paid them no mind as i didnt hear anything. about 10 min later i heard what sounded like someone walking behind us. i asked them to turn off the flash lights and i went and stood in the little path we walk threw in pitch black just watching. and in the distance to my right about 20 or 30 yards i hear a sort of grunt/growl. but i didnt see anyone. as i walked back to my chair and told them to keep there lights off. my nephew asked my other nephew if he keeps farting hes gonna punch him, i told him thats not a fart its to pungent to smell that way. as i have encountered that smell before on previous visits to that site to fish. after that i here a whooping noise noise behind us in the direction i heard the grunt/growl. i always thought it was like a big geese/goose at night, but we have never seen any at night. since ive herd that noise before it didnt bother me none, as ive herd it before. we ran our lines and packed up to leave about 12:30am as the 4 of us are walking out i got that feeling again that someone is following us back to the bridge to our right. again i dont mention it to my nephews or gf as i dont want to startle them of get them worried and panic as there easy to frighten. 2 days later i had seen one of your shows and herd the exact whooping noise that i had herd. and it got me to think what if it is you know! THE SQuatch. i asked my dad if hes ever herd these noises also as hes gone a few time with me fishing and when he herd the whooping noise and the tree knocking in the distance, he confirmed that he has heard that as well. and my dad is a believer but doesnt acknowledge it. He is the type that says things are out there but if you dont believe it it wont happen, if you go messing with it your gonna find yourself getting the you know what scared out of you. i did some digging on your website and found that there has been sightings near that area/town or county.","south of route 102, on s warner bridge road. under the bridge crossing",Kankakee County,Illinois,Summer,41.207,-88.01345,7/2/11,29836,Class B,92.23,80.32,68.41,0.04,Humid throughout the day.
"I have been walking my dog through Harris Forest Preserve for about 5 weeks now. About the last 3 days we have been walking back there I noticed a foul smell and starge howling noises. I didn't think much of it at the because I've heard alot of coyotes howling in the area. I should also add my dog seemed pretty stressed out and affraid the last couple walks we were on. The last walk we went on was kind of late, from 6 till about 7 pm after dark. We heard quite a few knocks on trees that seemed pretty close by and rocks were being thrown at me and my dog. At first I thought it was some kids screwing around, until I got through the trail to the pond in back. I was paralysed with fear after what happened next. I believe it was a Bigfoot that ran out about 10 feet in front of me and stopped for about 15 seconds, it let out a very loud scream right at me then turned around and ran straight through the pond. I also noticed that behind me appeared to be another very large figure that ran the opposite direction. The first one I got a very clear view of, I was 8 to 9 feet tall with very wide shoulders about twice as wide as mine, it had dark brown hair mixed with some grey, and it smelled awful. I did not get a very good look at the other one but it did appear to be 8 to 10 feet tall.

As I began the turn in an instant I saw a large figure standing near the edge of the corn along side the road (to my right). Quickly it leaned slightly forward and made a loud higher pitched sound, almost like a scream, or a call. Looking back I would consider that perhaps my pipes scared it.

"In 1953 I was a 10 year old girl living in George Field (Barracks), IL. George Field was a WWII air base for pilot training & the barracks housed airmen and brass. After the war the Barracks were converted to civilian apartments & my family lived in one. George Field was in an extremely remote area between Vincennes, Indiana & Lawrenceville, Illinois. The Wabash River was east close to Vincennes and the Embrass River was west - the rivers approximately 20-30 miles apart. The Barracks were surrounded by miles of corn and wheat fields. Often during the night I heard high pitched screams like a woman being attacked or killed. My parents told me the screams were panthers – I never saw any panthers. My sisters and I walked the corn and wheat fields as often as we could. Old timers told us to be careful of the “Grassman” which I later learned was their name for Big Foot. I thought Grassman was like the Wizard of Oz Scarecrow. One night my parents went out and left me with my older sister (who has since passed away). She was always teasing, aggravating and pulling pranks on anyone foolish to fall for her drama! That night she came close and said to me “Judy, there is something outside the window. Seriously, there is a monster outside came to the window – listen, you can hear it.” To shut her up I moved to the window and listened. (Our windows were usually open because we had no air-conditioning) I could hear something large moving around and saw a large head in the shadows. It walked around all the windows trying to look in and went from the back of the house to the front. Meanwhile, our middle sister came home – I knew she’d be coming in the front door where the monster was. I gathered all my nerve, opened the front door, turned on the porch light and screamed to my sister there was danger out there. I found myself looking eyeball to eyeball with the “Monster”. I am now 71 years old and know it was Bigfoot, which I didn’t know at the time. It had honey blonde hair and beautiful amber colored eyes. We startled each other, but it had an “Oh Shit” look on it’s face. My sister who had just returned home came running toward it and it turned to leave. My sister and I looked at each other for a second and “Bigfoot” was gone – disappeared instantly. Neither I nor my two sisters ever talked about it – we all forgot it – never told our parents or anyone. My memory of this incident never came back. 61 years later I started watching your T.V. show “Finding Bigfoot” – I’ve always had an interest in these creatures. It was like someone threw a switch and I remembered. I asked mys sister if she remembered anything and it came back to her. She remembered me screaming and also her chasing this “Bigfoot” thing. She said she chased it because I was hysterical and scared to death. I asked her if she ever told our parents or anyone and she said “no, she had also forgotten about it.” How can this be after 61 years? I think we were both so terrified our minds simply suppressed what we’d seen and your T.V. show was the trigger that restarted my memory.","George Field Barracks (a WWII airfield) then halfway between Lawrenceville and Vincennes, Indiana",Lawrence County,Illinois,Summer,38.76417,-87.60555,1/24/17,49182,Class B,43.25,40.595,37.94,0.89,Overcast until evening.
"It was around the year 1989.  I was working at McDonald's in Carlinville, Il and I had closed that night.  I was headed home at around 1:00 a.m. or 2:00 a.m.  I was headed west on IL Hwy 108.  I was going thru an area on the highway known to locals as Hagaman Bottoms.  Just as I was about to approach the bridge at the Bottom of Bell Hill I saw a large creature standing next to the road.  Just as I got near it or just about even with the creature it reached out at my car.  It scared me and I accelerated my car to get away from it.  It was a very bright moonlit night and I could tell that it was dark brown or black in color.  It was also tall as it stood above the top of my car.  The car I owned at the time was a Chevy Celebrity Eurosport.  I remember it standing facing east and when I was passing it it turned south and reached out with its right hand.  This was a very scarey experience for a young girl in a car going home all by herself.","Leaving Carlinville, IL headed west on IL Hwy 108.  There is a little town named Hagaman.

It kicked its back leg, turned to where it was looking at me and just stood there in the field on the passenger side of my car.

This figure was very large, broad shoulders and standing on two legs. I believe that I observed the backside of this figure as it was walking into the treeline since I could not see eyes in my headlights. I quickly stopped my vehicle to look at what I just saw but at that point my headlights were past the figure and I couldn't see anything.

"This is the second time that I have seen Bigfoot in my lifetime.  Both sightings have been in the same vicinity.  Here is my story of tonight's sighting.  I was going home from work from Carlinville and was driving west of Illinois Route 108.  As I approached a hill that was just east of the Hagaman turnoff I noticed a tall reddish brown creature crossing the highway going north.  It was at least 7-8 feet tall and was in the standing position.  As I approached the area that I saw it cross I looked in that direction and it was no where in sight.  I want to add that there have been many sightings in this area.  It is in Macoupin County, Illinois and both of my sightings were in an area known as ""Hagaman Bottoms"".

"Sighting number #2 was 3/20/2014. This just happened two days ago. I saw what I never thought I would see again, and how different this one was. Me and my friend was coming back from a road trip south when we decided to go down to a place on the Embarras River.  I like to fish and swim at what's called Spencer's Bridge. This used to be a county road that used to lead to a bridge that crossed the river, but the bridge is long and the area floods so much, no one uses it except for people fishing and swimming. I was going really slow because it had just been grated from the last flood. When in front of me I saw a fast dark moving object, it ran on all fours towards the tree line . When it turned south I could see that it was running on all fours as a ape would but fast. It stopped and turned towards us and you could see that it was dual colored, white on one side and brown on other, different yeah. It was too far away to get any more specific on the coloring but this one was much more heavier and hairier. Couldn't really see just how tall he was but his mass was a lot bigger than the last one I seen but that was in the dead of summer He turned and took one last look at us and disappeared into brush.

"I have had two sightings. The first was in July or August of 2002. It was one of those hot, and humid days of summer. Temperatures reached around 100 that day. So my then boyfriend, five year old daughter, his Rottweiler, and me decided to go to the river and swim at one of the many sandbars on the Embrass as some call the Ambraw. So our location was into an area that you would not see people just walking around or being out in. Very secluded very off the beaten path. We were swimming and eating lunch and hanging out when all of the sudden the dog starts going freaking nuts like I never seen. So I go up the incline on the beach towards where my truck was parked to see if maybe it was a farmer that had driven back there for some reason. The incline was steep enough that I could look across the grassy weedy tree area to the edge of a bean field where the truck was parked without anything of me being seen except for my head. When I looked over the edge of the bank right there in front of me, maybe 20 yards away, crossing through the under brush was something that my mind could not grasp.

"I went for a hike at lunchtime in a newly made path that cuts through the Timber Ridge Forest Preserve. This path is surrounded by about 8 ponds. It has been very cold and snowy here in the teens and 20's for almost a month except for one warm day that melted the snow. All this melt caused the crushed gravel path to act like a white clay, making all the hikers/dogs/coyotes footprints visible in a 30 foot area. Along with these prints are bare footprints about 13 "" long. Looking at the 5 pictures I took, they're deeper set than all the other shoe prints, with 5 distinct toes.

"It was about 1977 me and a friend from high school, we had dirt bikes, and the only way you could get to the place with motorcycles,  was to go down some railroad tracks and there at the railroad trestle there is a small creek that ran underneath it. It was cleared off and they used to take care of it because there are high-powered tension lines in there too. We were on our bikes down by the creek and we heard something and we looked up, there was a small hill about sixteen feet high or so that used to go out and climb with our bikes.

"Late October, 2009 a friend and I was hunting for deer looking for tracks. We came across a bare footprint. Didn't really think much about it at the time. On Jan 5, 2010 we went hunting my friend dropped me off at a house that sits on the property, that no-one lives at. He dropped me off at 6.15 am, while I was getting suited up, I heard the lowest growl I have ever heard in my life. Almost so low that the ground shook. Anyway when I heard the growl I turn my flashlight in that direction. There are horses in that field, they were running and their eyes were full of fear. Well I continued to my stand and about thirty minutes later heard a single wood knock from 3 different directions. On top of that also heard what sounded like screech owls coming from same directions as the knocks. On Jan 11, 2010 my friend and I went to go shoot our guns with his son and nephew. My friends stand sit about 50 yards of the road with a fence about 40 yards away.

"After a late concert at the square in Canton, Illinois, my friend was bicycling home and turned right into the parking lot, that leads past a shed, fence, and dumpster. Hearing a shuffling bang noise near the dumpster, she slowed her bike and began looking. Behind the shed was more than a noise. A shadowy sasquatch shape. Its puffy balloon feet (as she described it), held up a stocky, not so tall frame (6 ft.). Startled, it turned and walked into the bushes, moving branches to get into the woods.This was a thinly wooded area, and on the other side, a corn field. So freaked out she said, ""what is that?"", and sped right home and told me. I could tell she was worried, and by her description, this did happen. We discused the situation further (5 minutes), then decided I should go check it out. She locked the doors and I got on my bike. I sped around the corner keeping my pedals quiet. The noise, there was the noise. I pulled over behind a pine tree, and quietly snuck up beside the fence staying low. At the minute I was ready, I turned on the flashlight under the fence. No feet were there.  But that noise, was it inside the dumpster? So I slowly snuck around the corner. Only one cover of the four covers was open on the dumpster, so when I was ready, I shown the light through it. A small coon was trapped. Unable to climb out of an almost empty dumpster. It was out of breath, and sad looking, so I put small cans and an old sign in to give it a ladder out. I went back later that evening and the coon was out and to check the shadows around there.  We think it heard the coon also, and may have ben trying to find a way inside. We dont know if it was hungry, or just trying to help the coon out.

"The evening of April 15, 2011 I was with fellow BFRO investigator Eric L. and BFRO enthusiast Sam. We were on a trail in the Shawnee National Forest southeast of Equality, IL.  We were using Sam's thermal imaging monocular (L-3 Comm. X200xp ). We had traveled on the trail up a slight incline and occasionally either doing a howl or some whoops. When we got to our point before we decided to turn back. During our return we started getting some return howls four to be exact over about a five minute period. This was confirmed by several others in our camp. Shortly after, on our way back to base camp, I saw a heat signature. This was rather a bright heat source, different from any of the deer heat source we had observed both before and after this. This ""Heat source"" was behind a tree first observed on the left side of the tree. It then disappeared only to reappear on the right side. This continued for about a minute or so and it was playing ""Peek a Boo"" more or less. During this observation Sam looked through them and all he said was "" Oh My God"". He said it was a squatch. Both Eric and Sam decided they wanted to move closer to the heat source. As they got closer to it, it got smaller and then moved from right to left through thickets or something. It then was gone. I was not able to make out any thing other than what appeared to be the head peeking out from behind different trees.",Shawnee National Forest,Hardin County,Illinois,Spring,37.60075,-88.38197,4/15/11,29165,Class A,66.57,55.34,44.11,0.41,Rain in the morning and evening.

"It was in the summer of 2012 around 7 pm. It was very hot outside and we had been in a long drought. The nearest town is Makanda IL. The nearest road is Progress Lane which is off of Water V vcalley road. I believe it is near Union county. I had been told from a friend about some weird creature he had seen in the woods around this area. He claimed to have seen it once directly and heard it stalking him another time. He never said he thought it was a Bigfoot but I was still curious so I went out there to look around and see what he was talking about. He had told me that he had been out there many times and most of the time there was nothing strange. However, his girlfriend’s grandfather had told him that there were weird creatures out in the woods. He described them to me as being 7 to 8 feet tall with glowing eyes and only moved at night for the most part. I have never seen any creatures out there but on one of my several trips out there in search of anything weird I could find I came upon a few trees with branches that had been snapped. I’m 6’4 and 230lbs and tried hanging on limbs in similar trees and couldn’t even come close to breaking them. I took pictures of one of the trees with my friend who is 5’3 standing next to the broken branches for reference. I thought that it was awfully strange that they were broken the way they were. It was as if something had broken them. We kept walking through the woods and about 10 yards past the trees with broken limbs; we found a poorly crafted hut. It was just big enough for me (being 6’4) to fit in. It was made out of very large logs and tree limbs. They were big enough that I couldn’t move them at all. They were leaned together perfectly to create a shelter. While I was sitting in this shelter wondering how it could have been put together so well so far out in the woods I noticed a path leading out of it and into the woods. I followed the path and it led me to a place where water runs to when it rains to form a watering hole. I walked back to the shelter and took a picture of it. Sadly it isn’t a great one but I know it is still standing and can walk to it. It began to get dark and so we headed back to the truck and left. It was months later I saw an episode of Finding Bigfoot where Matt and Bobo found something very similar to what I found only the one I found was much bigger. It occurred to me that my friend who told me about the weird creatures and personal experiences I have been told relates to the behavior of Bigfoots. While investigating more about this area and its history, I found a map of the area in which all this occurred and the area was very close to a lake that I fish often with a friend. On several of our fishing trips we would stay out late after dark and catfish. While we were fishing those nights we kept hearing very strange sounds coming out of the woods. They were strange enough that both of us were a bit nervous about them because out of all of our fishing trips we had never heard these sounds. Shortly after we talked about them and kind of brushed it off as “the woods” we heard a giant splash in the water, as if a big rock was thrown at us. It was close enough to us that I jumped grabbed our spotlight and tried to see what happened. It sounded like it was within 30 or 40 feet of us but I couldn’t see anything. I remember joking about it being Bigfoot trying to warn us away from his area then hearing more strange noises and another giant splash. It was a slightly windy night and very dark and with only one light I couldn’t see where the splash came from or anything in the woods. Shortly after that we decided it was time to call it a night and left. This happened on at least 3 occasions in about a month’s time. Every time the conditions were the same, it was a cool night slightly windy and very dark. The lake we were on was Little Grassy Lake. In the area of the lake we were on there are many lily pads and a large area of very shallow water. On those nights we thought we could hear something moving around in the water but it was far enough away that the spotlight couldn’t reach it. We stopped fishing there because the water level dropped so low that there was no water to fish in or even to put a boat during the rest of the year. The incident at the lake took place in early April of 2012. It was during the summer of 2012, only a few months later, that I found the shelter and broken tree limbs. The way it looks to me is that a Bigfoot was in the area at the time of the fishing trips. There was plenty of water, food and shelter in an unpopulated rural area. When the summer came we experienced the longest drought in over 50 years. It would make sense to me that the Bigfoot would move to a different location because all the water in the area dried up. When I was out there was in September of 2012 I was taking my friends out there to show them the shelter and see if it was still there. While standing in a nearby graveyard I heard a large amount of chattering. I couldn’t determine where it was coming from but it was like voices off in the distance. At first I thought I had to be people talking, but as I walked around trying to find them I realized I couldn’t understand anything being said no matter how close the voices sounded. While watching an episode of Finding Bigfoot I heard them talk about Bigfoots chattering and how it sounded like people that you couldn’t understand. I believe that there are Bigfoot that inhabit this area. I went out again March 1st, 2013 at about 11pm to try and do a night trip. I had never been out at night and wanted to try and see if I could find anything different than what I had already found.  We walked about a mile and a half out into the woods staying near a beaten path.  After we reached a certain point where the woods open up a bit we went off the path and started wandering.  We took a break and were standing quietly talking about where to go next or if we should stay.  It was lightly snowing and very cold so we weren’t sure how much longer we wanted to stay being as it was already 2:30am.  While standing there I was talking to my friend who is a marine and another guy said “is that a… moan?” we stopped instantly and all 4 of us hear loud groaning or moaning sound.  Its hard to describe but it put all of us on edge as it stopped.  We decided to continue searching around a little longer and we walked down along the edge of the woods and I shined my light into the woods maybe 50 yards (not 100% sure on distance) away from where we were when we heard the moan only 5 minutes before.  When I shined my light into the woods I say what seemed to be a thumbtack on a tree, there are many thumbtacks on trees in  this area and I’m not sure why.  As I watched to make sure it was a thumbtack a head turned and looked at me and I could clearly make out two eyes.  I stared at them and they stared back and I said “guys… guys… I see eyes are you seeing this?”  My friends ran back to me, I never took my eyes off of the eyes, my marine friend made it to me first and the eyes were still just staring at me.  As he started looking for them and more flashlights were turned on I watched as the head disappeared behind the tree it was standing next to. I have seen many eyes from deer having grown up in southern Illinois and these just didn’t seem like deer eyes.  The way they were positioned on the head wasn’t right.  They were closer together than deer eyes.  Usually deer will run when there are multiple people moving around them as closely as we were.  The eyes seemed to be about 40 feet away and it was like they sidestepped behind the tree, never looking away from me.  I’m not sure if they can but I have never seen a deer sidestep.  The eyes seemed to be 5 to 6 feet off the ground.  I was also looking downhill at them.  I went into the woods within 45 seconds of them going behind the tree and never heard anything run away but we were unable to move through the woods quietly at all. When we reached the tree I believed they went behind there was nothing there and we could find no tracks in the half snow half dead leaf covered ground.  At this point it was nearly 3 and we decided to start making our way back.  What I believe happened is that a Bigfoot saw us up the hill and made a call which was the moaning sound we all heard.  I don’t know that was I saw was a Bigfoot but I can’t explain it saying it was for anything else either.  I find it hard to believe a deer would have acted the way what I saw did.  The eyes didn’t seem like a deer but there are no other animals in this area that have eyes that big that could be that far off the ground.  The angle of the head wasn’t right for it to be an animal like a raccoon on the tree.  It was as if something peaked out as we were walking by and I just happened to see it. The eyes stayed in sight for maybe 45 seconds and disappeared behind back behind the tree and the height of the head never changed. The next night I went out with almost the same group of people.  We got there at 1:30am and left at roughly 4am. It was much colder and not snowing.  We walked the same path we did the night before.  All the way to the spot where we heard the moan the night before it sounded like something was moving through the woods.  At first I didn’t think anything of it but we walked for a solid mile and constantly heard something moving to our left. The two people in the back occasionally claimed to hear something on the right that sounded almost like a pig snorting or a horse sighing heavily.  I never heard these things but I was also at the front of the line and 15 feet in front of them.  I almost turned around and left several times because I had the strong feeling something was stalking us.  Constant twig snaps and I heard one woodknock all from the left side of the path. Like I said we walked at least a mile and I heard these things the entire way.  Once we reached the area where we had heard the moan the night before we heard nothing.  We stayed and walked around the area just as we did the night before and heard nothing and saw nothing and after the cold really started to get to us we decided to leave. It was not as interesting as the night before that but the sounds from the woods were very strange to say the least. I’ve been in the woods, those woods, many times and haven’t heard the twig snaps or a woodknock before and I’d never had such a feeling of being followed/watched.",Its hard to explain how to get there unless you know the area.

"I had previously written an Email to BFRO and explained my encounter with a sasquatch that we called the big muddy monster at a pond called A-41.

I was the bartender at the Midland Inn in Murphysboro, Illinois. This thing was in the wooded area behind where I was fishing. I kept hearing the brush breaking behind me but thought it was squirrels or deer or turkey. Then it started breaking whole trees, snapping them like they were twigs. I started getting very scared as the area I was fishing was miles from my truck or any roads. you had to trek in. Then a huge chunk of rock splashed into the water in front of me, then another. I turned around and it was standing there looking very pissed off that I was there. It immediately let out a scream. I can still imitate this scream. It starts out as a high pitched siren type scream that makes every hair on your body stand up. Then it gets higher pitched and is so loud you cant believe what is happening. With one step this thing could have reached out and twisted my head right off my shoulders. I knew I could not out run it so I just froze. I could not believe what was happening or what I was seeing. This thing was 5 feet wide at the shoulders. I was on the lower side of the hill so I could not get a real good estimate on height but I'm going to say it had to be at least 7 feet high. Nothing but pure muscular athletic bodybuilder outlined upper torso. A couple seconds after it screamed I was trying to think of an escape and turned away from it. It retreated back into the woods so fast that I lost sight of it against the wooded background almost immediately. I grabbed whatever gear I could and started running back down the trail as fast as I could. I don't know what I left there or what I took with me. I ran as far as I could until all I could do was a fast jog all the way back to the car. I was playing rugby for SIU at the time and was in pretty good physical shape. The whole time I was running I was thinking that it could have over took me at any time. There is more to this story. I had been fishing for bass with large shiner minnows for a couple hours. I was hearing something behind me in the brush. I kept fishing, something was stealing my bait off the hook time after time but I could never hook anything. A fat black water moccasin surfaced around the bank so I switched hooks to a #5 treble hook and snagged it. When I set it down on the bank and beat its head in with a stick, That's when all hell broke loose. To me it seemed that the creature was watching me the whole time I was fishing. After I killed the snake and wrapped it around a branch I pinned it to a tree. Right then is when the huge rocks hit the water, trees started snapping and I turned around to the scream. This is a true story. I fished this small lake several times before this happened but have never returned. My memory will never forget this spot on the lake, the snake, the scream, the creature. It has been over twenty years. Story has always been told the same. I told this story to a BFRO rep. about four years ago and I think it was the guy who covers Jackson County, Illinois. I told him about the A41 lake and that he could find what he was looking for right there. He asked me to make a report on the site but I did not. Now after seeing this episode of Monsters and mysteries in America and the guy from the Murphysboro salvage yard describing the scream exactly I knew I had to come forward. This is true and it really does exist.",This is a small lake on a map created by Illinois Department of Conservation. I was fishing this lake because it had a 21 inch length minimum limit.

While driving my work van just as I was coming over the top of the hill (over pass) a tall dark figure passed in the tree line. It was walking too tall for a human. It was maybe 7 to 8 foot range because it was at the mid point of the trees. There isn't a rise there it's flat I checked because I drive this way 5 days a week twice a day.

"Me, my wife, and another hiking buddy (a female) had just hiked seven miles from the entrance of Red Cedar Trail, at Giant City State Park, to the primitive campsite where we set up our sleeping arrangements. My wife set her tent against the northwest part of the site. I was sleeping in a hammock and cocoon with a hammock tarp as my shelter southwest of her. My friend was also in a hammock/tarp southeast of my wife's tent. After setting up our sleeping arrangements, we started a fire with some fell wood that we found laying around the site. Once the fire was going good, we say down and reconstituted some dehydrated food that we hiked in. We drank tea and ate until our bellies were full. Afterward, me and my wife went to bed, while my friend stayed up and played on her phone. After a few minutes, she went to bed as well. To be perfectly transparent, I want to share a detail which may be of use to critics, but I know better as it relates to my story. Where I had my hammock, walnuts occasionally fell from the tree and hit my tarp and rolled off onto the campsite grounds. This was a common event and one I'm used to hearing as an avid hiker. I'm no novice to forest sounds and behaviors. The night progressed and the fire burned out. I remember poking my head out of the cocoon and looking at the fire to see how dim it was becoming. Because the campsite was so remote, I knew it would soon be pitch black. I remember a walnut falling the tree and striking my tarp. It rolled off into the darkness and found its resting spot. The fire grew dimmer and dimmer until I grew bored of watching it. I zipped myself within the cocoon and fell asleep. Sometime later, a loud thud woke from my sleep. ""Maybe another walnut,"" I thought. Only it wasn't. It couldn't have been. Nothing ever hit the ground. Nothing rolled away off the of my pitched tarp. My heart raced. As I said before, I am an avid hiker/camper and I always look out of my hammock and under my tarp to see what's in the cap, but this time was different. I froze and couldn't move. It was like an involuntary fear that I've rarely experienced. I stayed that way until I calmed down, but never mustered the courage to look outside of my cocoon. The next morning, the first thing my wife tells me was that a bi-pedal creature was walking around her tent last night. My friend said, ""Mine, too!"" I tell them, ""Something slapped my shelter."" I go on to explain that it wasn't a walnut that fell on my tarp, because it never it hit the ground. My wife then tells us both that she heard two howls several minutes later and that they were about 15 minutes apart. According to her, the howl sound like a sign that paused at a very high pitch then broke into two small howls, then paused and two more small howls. That repeated itself another time. Me and my friend did not hear not, likely because we had fallen back to sleep. We left that campsite knowing we had an unexplainable experience. Although my friend is hesitant to believe it was the big guy, she does not deny that something with two legs was walking around her that night. As for me, I remain convinced that something slapped my tarp. My wife believes it was because I was a man, while her and my friend were female. Regardless, something with two legs entered our camp, in the dead of night, in pitch blackness, and left us unharmed, but fearful to look outside. We all shared that sense of fear and dread that we felt, but left the park not seeing the big guy, but at least two of us believing we were in close proximity to it.","The event occurred at Red Cedar's primitive campsite about a half mile west of Shiloh Road and roughly two miles east of state route 51.

"Hi, I am 47 years old and I am a truck driver. I had an eye witness of something yesterday January 16 2013 in Clark Co. Ill.  I was driving down I-70 east bound around 7:30 am  when I noticed something in the field about 200-300 yards away.  It was black in color, fairly big but seemed to be squatted down with its back to me. At first I thought it was a bear but as I got closer its form resembled more of an ape like form.  Then before I passed it, it began to move away toward the woods.  As it moved it was moving like if you were to squat down and then try to walk while squatted.  I can't say that it was a big foot but I have no other explanation for it.  I have been hunting since I was 15 years old and I have seen a lot of animals but I have never seen anything like this and the way it moved.",Approximately at the 144 milepost along I-70 near Marshall.,Clark County,Illinois,Winter,39.40458,-87.7313,1/16/13,39084,Class B,34.54,32.485,30.43,0.18,Mostly cloudy starting in the evening.

Two friends and I heard Unfamiliar vocalization coming from within approximately 1000 ft of our campfire.We were looking for a lost 4 week old kitten at the time. This vocalization set off a series of responses from other wildlife up and down the river for the next three or four minutes. We are all familiar with MOST of the wildlife in that area and could not place that deep voice from anything familiar. Apparently what ever it is, it answers to ""Kitty Kitty"".

"My Fiancé and I decided to hike the Spurgeon Hollow Loop Trail in Washington County Indiana. The Trail is a 9-mile loop starting at Spurgeon Hollow Lake looping north towards Delany Creek State Park then continuing east and south connecting to the Knobstone Trail. (The Knobstone Trail is rugged state-maintained trail that winds approximately 60 miles through the Southern Indiana hills). The trail then turns west diverging from the Knobstone Trail to return to the trailhead at Spurgeon Hollow Lake. The Spurgeon Hollow Trail is situated in the middle of the Washington-Jackson State Forest. The Spurgeon Hollow Trailhead is reached from a county road a few miles off state highway 135, then a half mile off the county road down a dirt/gravel lane crossing through a couple of dry stream beds. We arrived around 1:30 pm on Friday June 12, 2020. It was a sunny day with low humidity in the upper 70’s (which is why we chose to hike this day). From the trailhead the path continues for a quarter mile or so and parallels the lake on your right and steep thickly wooded hills on your left. At this point, the trail splits to begin the Loop. You can go left up the steep hillside (several hundred feet climb) or continue on your right along the Lake. On this initial Trailhead path, I heard two distinct knocks. We had gone most of the quarter mile. I heard the first sharp knock. Then a second or two later, the second knock. Both in the same general area – up the steep slope to the left. I stopped at the looked, but could not see anything because of the dense vegetation. There was no other sound. The knocks were sharp and moderately loud. They sounded like the report of a baseball coming off a bat. There were no other people on the trail. No one at the Lake. My Fiancé stopped and looked back at me. I asked her if she heard those knocks. She of course made fun of me and said “Oooo it’s a Squatch”. She hadn’t heard anything. We continued on. We took the left trail up the steep slopes and for the next 6 miles went up and down steep inclines and declines. Crossed several creeks. Then about 3 hours later, the trail turned left diverging from the Knobstone Trail heading back towards Spurgeon Hollow Lake. The trail at this point parallels a large creek bed at the bottom of hills. We had gone a mile or so (about 2+ miles to go to reach the Trailhead). There was a knock. A very loud, very sharp knock. We both stopped dead. My fiancé’s eyes were wide as saucers. She said “that was loud”. I laughed and said “so what do you think that was?” The knock sounded again like the crack of a baseball coming off a bat. A huge baseball and a huge bat! It came from the steep hill top above us. We scanned the ridgeline, but could not see much. It was just too thick. I heard the brief sound of something moving in the brush up high, but that was it. My Fiancé said “Let’s Go”. I asked her “don’t you want to stay and see if something else happens?” She said “No I want to Go”. So we starting walking. A couple of times I would stop and scan the hills. She would say “Just keep walking”. We returned to trailhead with no further incident.","The Spurgeon Hollow Trail is off of Delaney Park Road a few miles east of State Road 135 north from Salem, IN.

"My husband and I were on a motorcycle ride to Siloam Springs State Park. We were driving about 40 to 45 miles per hour on a blacktop coming down a hill when I thought I saw a burnt tree trunk ahead on my right.  As we got closer I noticed hair so I looked it up and down and what I was looking at really shocked me.  I could see his side view very clearly.  It had a human body larger than a man's and very muscular. It had dark reddish brown hair about 2 to 3 inches long all over except for the head and face which was grey and white and I could even see light flesh under it.  It was standing straight with arms down by its side I could even see its fingers. It was looking down at the ground and standing very still. The back of his head looked rounded, but from his side he had a pronounced brow area that slanted upward to the crown of his head. His head looked like it set directly on his shoulders, I didn't notice a neck.  His face didn't have much hair and his lips looked thin and wide. When we drove back by the spot where I saw it, about 20 minutes later, there was nothing there.","From county road 1200th to 2873rd E going south,  at the bottom of the first hill on an embankment on the west side of the road.",Adams County,Illinois,Summer,39.91682,-90.95499,6/22/13,41718,Class A,89.49,79.94,70.39,0.47,Humid throughout the day and partly cloudy in the morning.
"The first Tuesday of August 2011 I was pulling up to a hunting area, I had parked the car and was getting ready to get out and get my gear. It was a little bit after 4 o'clock in the morning because I had just dropped my wife off at work so it was still two hours before sunup. So, I was sitting there, getting ready to get my gear when all of a sudden a just got this chill all over me, the hair stood up on the back of my neck, my arms, and something inside just told me ""don't get out of the car"". So I sat there, I drank a 16 oz Full Throttle energy drink, so with my kidney problems in the past, kidney stones, when I have to go I have to go or my kidneys start hurting. So I finally broke down and stepped out of the car, I didn't even step completely out of the car, I was between the car and the door. I caught this brief scent that smelt skunky and musky. But it was really, really light so I didn't really think a whole lot about it. I didn't have a flashlight shining around at the time because I didn't think I would be in the woods long before the sun would come up. I figured I would go out there and catch an hour or two nap before the sun came up. So, I got back in the car and an hour later I had to relieve myself again. I got out, I didn't hear anything, I didn't see anything and this time I didn't smell anything. So I relieved myself and got back in the car. I waited for sunup, where it started getting light enough so you could see where you are going. I walked down the trail to this pond, which is on the north side of the fire access road. And I sat there for about fifteen, twenty minutes and I came back up to the road and I started walking east on the fire access road. I came across this turkey scratch in the middle of the gravel pad, it was hard packed with a light dust on it. And there was a beautiful track, the toes were visible. I took a picture of it with my hunting boot which is a 10 EEE beside it for comparison. It was so fresh in that dust the picture showed up really good. However, when I went back the next day due to the wind the track was no longer visible because the dust is so light, which tells me it was an extremely fresh track because you can see from the photo that the track is plainly visible with very good definition considering the dusting ground that it was on.",,Alexander County,Illinois,Summer,37.18404,-89.36896,8/2/11,40474,Class B,96.52,88.64,80.76,0.11,Foggy in the morning and humid throughout the day.
"October 10th, 2011, it was a Tuesday morning I believe, no it wouldn’t be a Tuesday morning because I was out here in the afternoon. I was walking down that trail on the next ridge over. I was just coming back from the other campsite over there that somebody had made. I had been doing tree knocks and whoops to no avail, no sound, no return calls or anything and when I came back off the ridge to the main fire access trail I noticed a large pile of feces. No, first I saw the footprint. It measured nineteen inches long, seven and a quarter inches wide at the ball of the foot where the toes connect and it was five and a half inches wide at the heel. I saw that and I said “XXXX!” And then I looked down and started measuring it and everything and I walked a little and that is exactly what I found was a pile of feces. The makeup of it was vegetable matter, mostly vegetable matter, crayfish, shells from the skull part not the tails. I guess they can’t digest the hard shell of it. And there was also mollusks, fresh water mollusks shell mixed up in the feces, and I took a picture of that and accidentally mishandled that photo and accidentally got deleted when I tried to transfer it to my memory card and to my computer. And I took maybe two or three steps after that and I looked up and saw… he was seven to seven and a half feet tall, I’m guessing, he was probably bigger, I was terrified at the time. He was maybe three hundred, three hundred-fifty lbs. And he was about eighty feet away, seventy to eighty feet and he closed half that distance in three steps before he veered off the hill at a forty-five degree angle, ran down the ridge which is about an eight per cent grade for about maybe about 150 feet and then hits the valley of the two ridges and went up the next ridge which is about as steep and tall. So fast you couldn’t match it on a horse, motorcycle, three-wheeler even if it was paved. It was digging up a ground hornet’s nest and later I discovered by looking on line that hornets make what is known as hornet honey which is a concentrated nectar mixed with insect protein that they store with the larva. Now it’s not in large doses from my understanding but if you was to dig up an entire hornet’s nest (as the picture of the hornet’s nest you have that he dug up) you could get quite a nice little bit of nutrition from that much. If he made any sound it was no louder than say a squirrel moving through the leaves which for something so large moving and so fast is amazing. The bulk of its chest was just unbelievably broad, thick and dense. You could see the muscles moving. As it was running through, it was partly cloudy and there were still some leaves on the trees, and as it was running it ran through a bit of light coming through the canopy I could see that’s fur was dark brownish with a really bright red tint to it when the sun hit it directly. And he was gone up this other ridge and I collected my stuff and started running back to my car.",,Alexander County,Illinois,Fall,37.18404,-89.36896,10/10/11,36246,Class A,80.02,69.965,59.91,0.46,Partly cloudy starting in the afternoon.
"I was in bed and heard my dogs barking outside. I went out in time to see the dog run under the porch and something duck into the woods. I first thought it to be a large man in a coat but upon shouting and throwing a small stone into the trees discovered otherwise. Responding to my shout it shrieked/howled and tossed the stone back at me. It landed at my feet and then silence took hold in the trees again. I ran inside in a panic and finding a flashlight headed out to search for the intruder. I found only torn twisted horseweed and snapped branches about five and a half feet up.

"Saturday night I was driving at 10:30 PM in Central Illinois heading from Cass County to Tazewell County. A car was probably 3/4 mile ahead of me and I could see their tail lights. I saw a large animal jump into the road about 40 yards ahead. When it hit the road I could see very large legs spread wide in a dead run with large swinging hairy arms. The arms switched back and forth close to the ground as its body was leaning forward. It leaped across the road in two jumps. When it hit the shoulder it looked back at me. I said to myself out loud ""f***ng Bigfoot!"" It was a about 2 seconds before it vanished in the darkness altogether but I could see it clearly. It was very large and even though it was hunched over nearly horizontal it still was close to being wider than my car and nearly to the top of my windshield. It blocked out the lights of the car ahead. It had shinny black hair.

"The following on-site interview was conducted by Stan Courtney on the 2nd of Nov 2010. The first name of the witness has been changed. Stan - How long have you been coming out here? Mark - I've been coming out here longer than I want to say, it's like early 1970's. Stan - And then how long have you been coming out here as a researcher? [ Bachelors Grove Cemetery in Cook County Forest Preserve ] Mark - I've been here, on and off, for ages. But the last three or four years I've been out here a lot. I'll spend an entire day just walking through the woods. That is when I started noticing things and I never realized what it may have been. [ A large teepee, pyramid structure, Cook County Forest Preserve ] Stan - The area we are standing next to right now, I don't know whether you would call it a structure but it is a group of about ten or fifteen trees that have all been pushed as a big teepee-like structure. Mark - They have been bent, they aren't all dead either. Stan - Has this structure always been here? Mark - I can't remember. Back in the 1980's I never really came back here that much, but it has been here the last ten years or so. And at one point there was much more of a structure. Somebody or something has taken some of it apart. Stan - Other than this particular structure have you found other things that you found interesting? [ One of several live trees that appear to be bent over and pinned to the ground, Cook County Forest Preserve ] Mark - Yes, there are unusual bent trees through-out the woods. I've never understood what goes around pulling full-grown trees over. If a tree breaks in a storm they usually snap or they de-root, these are just broken like at a four, five or six foot level like they have been yanked, fibers are still all connected, it just appears to be pulled over, there are dozens of them throughout the woods. In the area we are standing in now, there are all these broken logs all over the place. Stan - Have you been out here at night? Mark - Yeah, but not for ages, when I was a kid we did. But there are weird noises here. I have heard numerous stories of weird howls and growling. Stan - What have you heard yourself? Mark - I have heard deep growling before, just a couple times and I don't know what it is. It wasn't wind, there was definitely some real deep gruffy kind of moaning, growling sounds. Stan - What about footsteps? Have you ever heard footsteps? Mark - Oh yeah, you hear those out here a lot, but there are deer out here and everything, but sometimes when you walk down the path, that path is quite aways through the middle of the woods to get out here, and you're being followed sometimes. I come out here myself when there is no one else around and I'll swear I'm being followed sometimes. Stan - Earlier today there were sirens going off and we did hear what I thought was a howl. It was about 200 yards distant. So we heard something this morning that I don't think was a siren. Mark - I actually did at first but after I started listening it was a different noise than the siren. Stan - What about smells? Mark - Others report weird smells, real like freaky dead smells, that will come all of a sudden all over you. Stan - And you've smelled that? Mark - Yeah, I don't know how to describe it, we just call it death, kind of a weird freaky smell. Stan - This is an interesting area and of particular interest to me is that it is in Cook County. We're not talking about a so-called wilderness. Tell me about this woods and does this connect to other woods. Mark - This is actually the biggest section of woods in all of Cook County, it's massive, it runs from one side of the county to the other. If you look on a map it's huge, you might have to cross a street but once you cross you're in another massive forest preserve. Something could hide here anywhere it wanted. The woods go into Will County, it is a gigantic forest preserve. Stan - Does it connect up to any rivers or major streams? Mark - Yes, you can get to that side too, this actually goes all the way to IL 45. On the west side of IL 45 this runs all the way up to 55, the Interstate, this is just a massive area. All you have to do is just cross the street. Stan - In other words, nothing would have to be permanent in here. Mark - No, something in here could be cross town in the next day with no problem, and basically we are on the fringes where there are still rural areas. The woods are so interconnected that technically something could walk from here to the Joliet area if it wanted to, going at night it could just cross the fields. Stan - Do you ever get that watched feeling in the daytime? Mark - I actually got it today, I was going to ask you. There are days when I come out here I know I am being watched, just don't know from where. Sometime you come out here it's like being in the park, it's a nice beautiful forest reserve, and other times you come out it is just so creepy, you just feel like there are eyes everywhere. Stan - And did you say that you had stuff thrown at you before? Mark - Numerous things we've had things thrown at us, not acorns but those bigger nuts. They've actually smacked us before. I was out here with a friend where we had a log, six inch thick by six foot long physically fly out of the trees and land within about three feet of us. Then we actually left, looked up and said ""We can take a hint"" and then we walked out of here. Its just logs don't fall out of the sky very often. Stan - Have you ever experienced a bluff charge? Mark - No. There are deer out here too, but you will also hear something crunching because this is thick woods and then all of a sudden you hear nothing. Stan - Have you ever heard woodknocks? Mark - You know, to be honest, I probably haven't paid attention, I might have, I never looked at it from this point of view. We have a huge deer population, we have water right there. These are such thick woods, we're talking fall now, you should see this place in the summer, you can't see in here at all. Stan - It's a beautiful forest preserve. Mark - Yes, it is a neat forest and it is exciting to find out that what we have been seeing and hearing is indicative of possible sasquatch activity.",Bachelors Grove Cemetery which is near the intersection of 143rd Street and Ridgeland Avenue.,Cook County,Illinois,Fall,41.63243,-87.76622,11/2/10,28525,Class B,51.77,42.94,34.11,0.87,Clear throughout the day.
"I am going to be honest, before this happened, when it comes to bigfoot, I have been very skeptical, because there is not enough evidence that would make me even consider that there could be a bigfoot.

I was driving near Zoo Woods, which is some sort of forest area. I was driving and I was on the phone and I looked to my right and I saw something very, very tall, like between 8 and 9 foot and hairy. It was running through the woods. I remember the sun reflecting off the outside of the fur and it gave it like an orange tint. A Golden Retriever has that color hair, make that a little darker and with a little bit more copper-tone, more red-head feel to it. I think that would be the color I am trying to describe. I stopped in mid-traffic, I put my hazards on, I pulled over right away. I had just seen something moving through the trees, nine foot tall, orange fur, it just kind of ran through about five feet of brush. The trees were moving, I saw it.  I slammed on my brakes, got out of my car, put my hazards on, I ran over to where I saw it, because I had already passed it over, passed by it. I had to run back a little bit to go in the area where I saw it. There were broken tree branches. I couldn't see any prints, no fur, no evidence besides the broken trees. There was a terrible odor, like a musky, wet dog smell, maybe worse than that, more putrid. It was like if you are running through the woods and you are nine feet tall and you are about ten feet into the woods before the outside of the woods stopped, that's how far into the woods it was. It had arms, it was running and it was very big. I only told a couple of people, and then I let it go.","I was headed north on 1st Avenue (IL - 171). I remember seeing the sign that said Zoo Woods.

"We went to check out Bachelor's Grove yesterday. We saw the pyramid and the arched tree that was posted in . We also heard a siren, or something, exactly like what was posted in that same report. Not sure what it was, but it came from the direction of the road. I found a footprint with a broad heal and wide ball, deeply impressed into muddy soil. Other, less distinct heal prints were seen in an apparent trackway. I think it's about 15.5 inches long. The print was old, and there was some debris in it. Looks like there may have been some drag as well, but it was rather clear that there were toes. I should say prints, as I found 2 or 3 more heel impressions back from it, with about a 7 foot stride, but they were hard to make out, as other stuff had torn up the trail, so I didn't photograph them. I also could make out impressions in the dirt on the trail going in, that looked to have been made by a foot of about the same size. These were barely noticeable in the dirt, but there were three, with about a 7 foot stride. I would venture to say less than a month old, maybe only two weeks. That trail is very packed, and very traveled, so the must have been made just after a good rain. We did occasionally hear what we thought might have been voices. Really quiet, like someone was mumbling off in the brush.

"The following on-site interview was conducted by Stan Courtney. The first name of the witness has been changed. Stan - Jim, can you explain what happened? Jim - When I was about 16 years old, myself and two friends were parked by the woods, weren't drinking or anything, which is an important factor there. I actually saw a hand come around a tree, like you were gripping a tree, or something, but a big furry hand. And being a kid I thought it was a werewolf, the first thing I thought. And I told my buddies and they looked but didn't see it a first. Not even a moment later a big, I didn't know what it was, a big furry head stuck around the corner, peeked at us, and went right back. It didn't charge us and it didn't move. And then we took off from there like wildfire, just flew out of there. But, that is something we never really talked about because we never knew what it was. Stan - What year would this have been? Jim - That would have been in about 1974. Stan - And in summer? Jim - Yes, it would be middle of summer. It was just one of those little Forest Reserve cutoffs where you pull-in, and your car is kind of almost in the woods. Stan - How tall was it? Jim - I would have to say eight foot range. The hand was up there high, that is what caught me off-guard. Stan - And what color was it? Jim - It was a blackish-brown, I just remember seeing a big hand. You would almost mistake it for a gorilla-type thing. It is something that is not natural in Illinois. Stan - And were you able to see the face? Jim - Yeah, have you ever played peek-a-boo with the kids? You know how you do that? It was kind of like that, it stuck around the corner and went right back.

The past several months we have had some very strange activity going on around our house. We live out in the country and we've ignored alot of it. But here lately we can't ignore the activity going on. About a month or 2 ago my husband went outside to smoke he heard something and as he looked in our drive way he seen an animal that stood about 7 feet tall all hairy he couldn't explain it except that it looked like one of our dogs on 2 feet and extremely tall. It walked passed our trailer and that's how he could guess the hight could be. We've heard what sound like a baseball bat hitting a tree. We've heard whistles and calls of what a bigfoot sounds like. We've had chickens and cats go missing. Every night about the same time you can hear footsteps and sounds. It's to the point where we are scared to go outside. We've never believed in bigfoot till we seen it and have heard them I'm sure there are more than one around here cause we live near caves they sound like they are all around us at night.,We live around caves and we are wondering if they may be living in the caves behind us. We've heard it every night for the past several months last night I heard toys moving and some where in our creek this morning.

"I went fishing in Morgan Monroe State Forest with my two sons and our beagle. About mid day we heard something BIG in the woods near where we were fishing, way bigger than a deer running through the woods, in fact it was like a large crashing sound and about 30 seconds later there came the sound of a tree breaking. I suppose it's quite possible that an old rotten tree was in the process of falling down, and it didn't really scare us although it was odd. What happened for the next few hours was however beyond odd, it was downright spooky. For those who aren't familiar with Prather Lake, it's in a very remote part of Morgan Monroe and it's quite a hike to reach the lake when the access road is closed. When you get there you know that it is rarely visited, maybe due to the extremely rugged terrain or the long walk that it takes to get back there even when the road is open it's still quite a hike down a long downhill trail to reach the lake. Back to my experience, after hearing the noises coming from the woods nearby the lake my sons and I moved to another spot to fish. Not an easy feat when you're carting fishing gear and a stringer of fish because like I said, the terrain is rugged and steep. We moved to a place in about the middle of the lake and begin to fish again, this location was approximately the direct opposite side of the lake from where we heard the crash and tree breaking sounds. For the next few hours that we were fishing we heard sounds like someone banging on a tree with a tree branch. I guess in the world of Bigfoot research that's called knocking. The knocking seemed to be somewhat rhythmic in the sense that it was two or three big knocks followed by 10 or 15 minutes of silence. Our beagle was busy sniffing around all day long, like we'd never seen her sniff before, her level of excitement was through the roof! What was unusual about her behavior was that she was reluctant to leave our sight. She didn't venture out more than 20 or 30 yards from us until about the time we decided to leave. Anyone who owns a beagle knows that they love to sniff and love to stray away on the trail of what ever they are sniffing out and our dog is no exception. This day she didn't, and she seemed scared out of her wits. We were getting tired of fishing and were talking about leaving because we had about a hours walk ahead of us to get back to the car. We decided to finish out fishing because we only had about five night crawlers left and it seemed to be a waste to toss them. Our dog finally mustered the courage to venture out of our sight. She did so meandering up the mossy covered hill that we were at the bottom of and she was gone for about 15 minutes. We heard her rustling through the leaves and forest foliage and then she would get quite for a minute or two. I didn't think too much of it at the time until she let out a series of barks and whines that sounded more like she was in trouble than if she were on a trail. This got our attention and we looked in the direction of her calls, we heard her high-tailing it through the woods and she appeared racing down the hill in our direction. She raced toward me with her tail between her legs and nearly tripped me trying to hide behind me. We got a good laugh out of that figuring she probably got into it with some forest animal and it got the best of her. That's when we heard the knocking again- behind us in the same area that the dog had just returned from! We also noticed an extreme smell, like crap in the air. The dog began to bark and get super excited while looking up the hill behind us. She started to run up the hill again, but stopped short only about 10 feet from us and again raced back behind me and looking up the hill. Then we heard the knocking again. I decided it was time to go, my sons who are age 9 and 10 began to get spooked by all this excitement and honestly, so was I! All day long I had made up excuses for the weird noises we heard because I didn't want to say bigfoot or sasquatch around them and make them afraid to go into the forest. But things were beginning to get all too strange so we quickly packed up our gear, grabbed our fish (fought off the huge snapping turtle that was trying to steal the fish off of our stringer) and got the heck out of there. On the way back up the steep hill that lead back to the fire trail my oldest son said to me, ""Dad, do you think that Daisy (our dog) saw a big foot?""

"I was in the woods one morning when I heard a very distinct noise - or noises.

"One night while fishing with 2 friends on a creek outside town, it was nearing 11:00 pm. pitch black night. Fish were biting decent. But to pass the boredom my one friend found 2 sticks laying on the bridge.  In a humorous way he started beating them together. To join the fun I made a very odd whoop sound just for giggles. He put the sticks down and we went back to fishing. A couple minutes passed by and we heard what seemed an identical echo to the absurd noise I made. The sound was roughly half mile across a field and in a patch of timber on other side of field. I first thought it was another fishing friend playing a game with me so I made another whoop back. It was quiet for approximately 5 minutes. Then it whooped back again. To keep the fun and none the wiser I whooped back again. We waited. Then it made a whoop back. Only it was clearly out of the timber in into open field. Startled I told my friends that its on this side of the river which was just quarter mile down the creek we was fishing on. Still not sure what was talking back I whooped again. Then it proceeded to whoop back after I would wait a few minutes and be 50 yards closer every time. It oddly reminded me exactly of calling in a Spring time tom turkey. So I told my friends ill do it a couple more times but if it keeps getting closer I'm going to stop. And it kept getting closer every time it whooped. I finally told my friends it's probably 200 yards away. There is a little ditch draining into the creek between us and it so I felt safe but we were was startled enough that we packed everything we were fishing with on the bridge. We put our stuff into the buckets to leave in a hurry but we stayed on the bridge. I remember that this night we were not armed, oddly. So I told my friends if it comes closer imma reel my pole up and ""whip the shit out of it"" hahaha. Then right after that I got a bite on that pole. I hooked it reeled it up and got it on the bridge. It was a carp maybe 5 lbs. as all 3 of us are looking at this fish I just caught debating on keeping it or not the whoop returned. Only it was no more then 50 yards away just across the ditch from us. That was enuf for us. We put the fish back, grabbed our poles and buckets, grabbed our fish and loaded everything into my truck. We then stood by the vehicles with doors open lights on and ready for immediate escape. We stood with flash lights pointed on the only opening in the trees along the ditch. We could hear the thing walk 100+ yards up the ditch, cross over and walk back down towards us. With lights on we knew the footsteps were about to be right through our beam of light. Anxiously waiting what we saw puzzled us all together. it appeared to be the top of a head, maybe 4 inches of it. Hairy but it was whitish grey. This thing has been quiet for about 20 minutes at this point. It walked by with only showing the top of what I assume was its head. Headed to where the ditch met the creek and stopped. We could feel it staring us down, looking at us. Then out of nowhere it let out the biggest loudest cleanest whoop not 20 yards infront of us. It was down on the bank behind tall grass but we knew it was looking right at us when it did it. At the instance of the last whoop we flew into the vehicles, started them in gear and tore out of there before the starters stopped turning. We went up the road to the open field and blacktop to discuss what the hell just happened. We then went home and I told my ol lady what had happened. She was thinking we were crazy. We grabbed the gun and went back near where we were fishing, hoping to see it again. It was silent from then on. The next day me and one of my friends went back out in the daylight to see what had happened. I walked up to where we saw the head top and realized, it was a steep bank down to the ditch. Right where we saw the head top was a tree laying down. roughly 18"" starting to decay but still firm. I stood on it and asked my friend, who was standing in the spot we saw it from, if he could see me. He replied ""no"". I stretched my hand way up as far as I can. He yelled, ""I can see your fingers."" I cut hedge posts for a living so I am well aware where 7' stands next to me. This thing was over 7' tall. I told my cousins about it and they didn't believe the absurd sound I made but a few days later they were fishing in the same spot we had been and they heard the sound. It came from the opposite direction where it came to us from but they instantly new I wasn't lying, and mind you I was born in Missouri and moved to Kansas and I am an avid hunter and fisherman. I have never heard anything so preposterous of a sound as that night, but it only mimicked my exact sound, which puzzles me even more.",if you leave out of neosho falls past the park heading north to leroy it winds back and forth a couple times.

"I never gave much thought to bigfoot, especially living in Kansas.  I heard stories when I was a kid.  I was out for a walk by myself on a nice spring day enjoying nature and getting some peace and quiet away from my children.  I like to walk down to the Ninnescah River, so I went to the closest bridge by our house.  I walk quietly so I can hear everything around me, I practice listening to everything and using all my senses when I walk.  I got to the edge of the bridge at the river and I stopped as I saw a figure squatting down at the edge of the river.  First I thought it was a homeless person or local, but then I noticed they were covered in hair, so then I wondered why someone would be dressed in a bigfoot costume at this remote area by the river, then I looked around to see if there was anyone else filming trying to pull a hoax or something- you never know what the teenagers will do these days.  There was no one, and that's when I started noticing other details that pointed to the reality of the situation.  The bigfoot was breaking open mussels or clams or whatever and then eating them, which made me think 'Who would eat that raw from this dirty river where there is trash laying around?'.  That's when it fully dawned on me that this was not a human.  It was covered in a brown hair/fur.  It was squatting with its back towards me the whole time, it never looked back at me, and I didn't move until I turned and left to go home to try to get my phone to take a picture (which it was dark by the time I got home and there was nothing there when I got back).  It just kept opening mussels and eating them, and it would hit them on the rocks to break them open.  It had long arms, and it squatted flat footed, which I thought would be a difficult position to hold, as I squat with my heels up off the ground.  It's hands were shaped more like human hands, but the color was darker and the texture was kind of like gorilla/ape hands.  I couldn't say for sure how tall it was, but it seemed younger, probably 6+ foot or 7 foot tall, but I'd have to have someone help me determine how big it really was.  When I came back I didn't want to get down in the area because there are snakes around here.  I couldn't believe what I had seen, and didn't tell anyone, even my family, because this is Kansas.  I did make them squat to see if they did it flat footed- ha!  I also take them to the river whenever we go for walks.  I tried to get my husband to go for walks with me, so maybe he would see one, too, but he won't go for walks with me.  After the show aired I told my family about what I saw, now he might go for a walk with me!  I didn't think about reporting this to your site until Finding Bigfoot came to the very river I saw one at, and it clicked that Matt was the head of the BFRO and you might want to hear about this incident.  I saw it and I still can't believe it, why would anyone else believe it?  We live a couple blocks from the river, so if any investigators want to come check it out, you are welcome to stay here or base out of here.  I do have three children at home still, but we have a clean, nice, newer house with a couple guest rooms.

"My husband and I rented a cabin in Nashville. We just came down for a year to Indiana. About 11 PM we went to bed. Within minutes our dogs went nuts. My husband got up to check and opened the front door of the cabin. It is covered by a porch and it was raining hard. The porch light doesn't work so it was dark. He closed the door and told me to bring a flashlight and firearm. I ran out of bed and went to him by the door. He said something was breathing heavy on the porch to the left of the door. At this point it occurred to me that our dogs were strangely silent. Being Akita's that have seen bear, wolf, coyote, and lynx all up close in Alaska this was not normal. My husband slowly opened the door again I sure enough something was breathing very heavy just to the side of the door. It also smelled. It was really strong, musky mixed with soggy old carpet and wet dog We closed the door again while we chambered a round and I lit the flashlight and we did a tactical to the left where we had heard the sound. It was gone but wet foot prints that looked like they were made with soggy fuzzy bedroom slippers were across the floor. It had come across our front lawn and up the right side of the porch and across the door to the other side where we heard it. The prints were close together while passing the first window and the door and when it fled it did it in one step. The foot prints were alot larger then my foot in slippers which is a women's 9.5 wide. I wondered if it realized what chambering a round meant since we had opened the door twice and it stayed breathing heavy right on the other side right to the side where we couldn't see it. Dogs didn't scare it and us two talking didn't scare it. That would indicate it had had human interaction maybe with hunters before. Not uncommon with bears in Alaska. A lot of people will chamber a round not wanting to hurt it but ready to if it gets aggressive. They are smart and learn fast what that sound is. Another strange thing is that the dogs paced all night. They did not do this after confronting an 800 lb brown bear in Alaska..literally. They worked together and chased all of the above away from around the home. We lived in a cabin off the grid. Not sure if we have a stinky homeless person wearing bedroom slippers living in the woods but it was a very strange occurrence and my husband was career Ranger/SF. Not one to let his imagination run wild. We were stumped. The dogs (two of them) pooped in the cabin.

My wife and I were camping At Yellowood State Park this past Saturday night. About 1:00am we both were asleep and were woken by a loud hollering noise. It was a very deep howling noise but it wasn't a dog or coyote. The howling noise was very long and very close to our camper. Whatever it was made the howling noise twice and something off in the distance mimicked it both times. There was no barking afterwards and the noise was too loud and too deep to be a human. We both stayed awake for awhile and didn't hear anymore noises.,Yellowood State Park.

"I was going to Concordia, Kansas with my sister and her husband on August 31, 2017. We were on Hwy [24 & 9] going eastbound. I did not get the mile marker. I wasn't thinking about it. Around 9:35 pm I was telling my sister who was driving to be careful about deer running across the road cause we seen a few. Some did not even look at the truck we were in. Most were focused on the corn fields. Anyway when we got by a lake that is in the area, out of the corn field a big buff gorilla looking man hopped out on all fours, jumped from the corn field to my left in front of me and onto the left side of the road. He was on his knuckles. His head was like tucked in and he was big and quick and agile. He took an other jump and cleared the road moving left toward the edge of a cornfield. He stood when he got to the other side of the road. When he stood up my sister said ""What was that?""   I told her that was a bigfoot. I looked to the side. She wanted to stop. I said no sis we don't have a gun and we're women. Who knows what it would do. When he stood up he was at least 1 foot higher than the corn which had to be about 8 feet plus. When he stood up on the side of the road I could only see his outline cause the moon was not that full yet, almost though. I got a scared yet amazed feeling. I had rocks thrown at me before in Colorado but never seen them. To my eyes he was beautiful -- strong, had big legs, like a dark grey feet with black around his ankles and dark dark brown with hues of reddish at the tips of his hair. I could see muscle def in his body. His arms had to be at least 24 inches round or bigger cause he was big not skinny at the waist. Big legs to his ankles and his arms were bigger than most body builders. The only thing that I got out of that experience was when how tall he was. The body gesture was he seen us and I told my sister just leave him be. You know that was one of the most coolest thing I ever saw. He is real and as long it doesn't bug me I wont bug it.",there were two large long corn fields and a small lake was close. i forgot the sign after we got past the ball of twine.,Mitchell County,Kansas,Summer,39.30595,-98.2833,8/31/17,59633,Class A,86.05,73.285,60.52,0.32,Mostly cloudy in the afternoon.
"On 3/29/2014 at approximately 9:42 pm (I know this because of cell phone records) my daughter and her friend and I were coming back from a trip to Manhattan, KS on Burmac Road between McPherson and Burrton, KS after the S curve in the road.  I remember seeing the lights of a home in the distance and out of the corner of my eye I saw something white.  When I turned my head the large white animal was running at a high rate of speed towards my car.  It looked like he was going to hit the passenger side of the car.  This animal was gigantic, when it ran into the ditch it still looked taller than my car which is a 2009 Dodge Caliber.  It looked like this white animal was flying through the air at a high rate of speed.  When it hit the ditch we got a great look at the face and the features and its size.  It was really fuzzy, especially in the face and it had dark sunken eyes and a mouth that was not visible and the nose was not distinct.  The most memorable feature was the eyes....they were very black. It was on two legs but when it approached the ditch it used its front hands/paws for leverage.  It seemed extremely muscular and fit. When I first saw it, my daughter and I were talking, she had just said, omg my phone just died....I saw a flash of light and looked and said what the heck is that........?  My daughter said I don't know and she started screaming.  At this point she said she saw three images the first sighting for her he was on all 4 appendages the second time he was on two legs and the last time he was at the window.  We all agree that there was a ton of fur...!  When I thought it was going to hit the car I grabbed the steering wheel and jerked to the left.  The fur was about six plus inches long and had a weird pattern, I only say this because I am a cosmotoligist and hair growth pattern matters.  When I jerked the steering wheel to the left I almost went in the ditch on the left side.  I looked back but it was gone.........nothing was in my rear view mirror.  I instantly called my ex husband and left a voice mail and that was at 9:42pm he called back at 9:45pm and then told him that what we had witnessed 20 years ago I had just seen again only bigger and without the teeth!  He said I was freaking out and he was right! One of the most noticeable things about what we saw was that right after we saw this creature there was a tractor in a field and after Dutch Ave. there was a fire in a tree line.  When I saw the fire in the tree line my first thought was.........now I know why that thing was running.

"Ex special forces vet. Thus happened in the middle of July 2013. Lenexa, Kansas, Johnson County. Bike/walking path along small park. South of park. I was riding my bike from North to South. Area is very wooded and flows along a river. It was very below normal temperatures that week. Felt more like fall. High low 60s that week. Which was odd and weird. What happened as I'm heading up a large hill. To my immediate right or west. I heard a large wood knock. And I looked to my right and heard thus commotion in the very heavy brush. I had this feeling something very large was in there. And looking right at me. I've seen many types of animals in and around the area. From a mountain lion, a family of Bob cats. And hundreds of deer. I've rode those trails hundreds of times. As I was riding up the large and long climb I'd say 100 yards from first incident. Smack, another wood knock. Also loud. Now I'm thinking if bigfoot does exist, what a perfect time to come through this area. This river bed runs all the way to the Kansas river. By Bonner springs KS. So, when I heard the second smack, I said no way can someone be down in that bed. The effort required to get through the brush would be almost impossible... when I heard the first thump I said to myself. No way was that a bigfoot. But if it was it was warning another one. It was a tree falling or wind blowing. It was a large thud. And movement in the brush. My gut was telling me I was being watched. Then up the trail another one. Again, it was cool, foggy and little wind. Only reason I'm writing this is what the retired police officer from Wyandotte wrote. Thus bed would feed to the same area. But, about 20 miles south. If I was going to travel and not wanting to be seen. This would be the perfect area to accomplish this journey. And there are several areas to portage across the river.

"It was about 2 months ago, I was coming home from taking my sister home after we got out of work, roughly 1:30 am. I was on the phone with my sister as we live just 5 miles apart, (in my mind) so I didn't have to drive alone. About 3/4 of the way home something came off the side of the road so fast I had no time to brake. I told my sister that I thought I had hit a person, she asked if it was a deer? I said no it was upright and well over 6 ft tall. she said go back and look... so I turned around and went back and there was nothing there..a few days later we went to the local cafe for breakfast and I was talking with a native lady and I had asked her what kind of creature was on the reservation, she turned pale white and asked ""who told you?"" At that point I was covered in goose bumps and asked who told you? she said did you see it? I said yes and not only that I had hit it.. she was about in tears as she told me stories of elders being chased and another being chased after shooting at it in a tree, then she told me of her brother-in-law seeing it and was so scared he will not return to the reservation. I have asked around since then to other members and its always the same thing, the native people are afraid of it, they say it comes to you when it wants to tell you something and only the chosen ones will see it. I am not sure what I seen that night but it was very large, my husband is over 6 ft and 350lbs, and it was definitely larger than him, but the classic stories of being super hairy does not match what I seen. The creature I seen was tall and hairy but not long hair as I had always assumed it was, color was more brown than black, I never seen its face so I am not sure of facial looks, but large head, very long arms,and very fast.. I hit it with my car and it broke my bumper but didn't seem to slow it at all. I am not wanting fame or any TV time. I really don't want my name mentioned, we do live in a small community. But I would love for you guys to investigate the reservation.","I live on the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation Reservation, it is 20 minutes north of Topeka KS on 75 Hwy.",Jackson County,Kansas,Fall,39.2305,-95.44415,10/15/12,38440,Class A,77.97,68.05,58.13,0.01,Clear throughout the day.
"While bow hunting in a field in Kansas, I observed something that I could only describe as a Sasquatch. I was sitting on a stool next to a round bail of hay near the tree line. I was near a deer scrape. As I sat watching the tree line to no avail, it began to get too dark to see my fiber optic pins on my bow. So, I began gathering my gear to make my move to my vehicle. My friend was hunting farther up the tree line in the timber. After gathering my belongings there was still enough light to see an opening near a corn patch. As I stood up I saw a figure which I thought was my hunting buddy. I said in a normal voice, ""Did you see anything?"" The figure did not reply. Upon further observation I saw that it was walking in my general direction. It stopped next to a round bail and I realized that the figure was at least 3-4 foot taller than the bail of hay. I began moving toward the tree line as to not silhouette myself. As the figure was closing the distance to 100-125 yards I began to make out body features. The head was kind of high with no visual neck, broad shoulders which tapered down to a slim looking torso. The outline of the body allowed me to see that his arms, shoulders, legs were extremely muscular, like that of a professional athlete. The arms were longer than normal and he walked in silence. As I stood there trying to figure out who or what I was seeing, I never had a sense of fear. I had my iPhone on me but it never dawned on me to make video because I was in what felt like a dream like trance or shock. As I realized what I may be seeing I hastily skirted the tree line to my truck. As I approached my truck the first thing I did was open my palm and slapped the shit out of my tailgate. As, I hit my trucks tailgate I then observed the figure drop down on all fours and in four seconds flat it was gone. It either used the bails as cover or it was the fastest living thing I have ever seen move. After meeting with my buddy he informed me that he shot an arrow at a buck, but it ricochet off of the breast plate. He then informed me that the deer was going to run in my general direction toward the field but the buck stopped in his tracks and looked into the field, then turned around and came running back from the same direction that my buddy just shot at him from.","Location on Map: 39.680008, -95.696218",Jackson County,Kansas,Fall,39.4045,-94.91451,10/4/14,65984,Class A,59.78,52.375,44.97,0.37,Partly cloudy throughout the day.

"November 20, 2011 Was deer hunting on the farm behind my house like ever year before. That season I used my hunting blind that I had setup a few days before. It had been raining that morning so I used the 4 wheeler to get back to the blind. I parked it beside the blind and took my stuff in. I poured a cup of coffee and opened a bag of donuts and loaded the gun. I could hear something step over the fence (normal sized person could not do that) this fence is double wide with extra electric wire. Then the foot steps continued to come closer to the blind. The foot steps sounded really heavy. The foot steps came to the side of the blind and stopped. I could hear heavy breathing and then it leaned over the blind . I could see a impression of a nose pushing down on the top of the center of the blind. The blind I have is 6 feet tall, this means he had to be at least 8 feet plus tall. The nose imprint began sniffing and leaning more on the top of the blind. This point I was getting really nervous, so I took the safety off on the gun and said (""if you are a person you better leave, if your a bigfoot then you better not growl or howl our push any harder on the blind cause I'm gonna start blowing holes in something"". Then the sniffing stopped while I said my little speech, but then started again more aggressively. I told myself to stay calm ,and then the subject stood upward and walked around the blind and then over to the woods. I tried looking out the window but could not see anything..

This is the second incident I've had at my family's property in Stanton Kentucky. The first one was scary and all (had a rock thrown at my dads truck and made a huge crash in the dark) but this one has basically scared me away from my parents house at night! This was right before Christmas and we had record high temps close to 70 so I was hanging out on their front porch. Last time I was there I smacked some wood planks together and got a response so I figured I would try again. So I stood up and grabbed a piece of wood (we just built their deck so there are pieces laying around) and hit the hand rail of the deck 3 times very slow. I waited not even 15 seconds and got 3 hits back. I was shocked because it sounded like it was no more then 50 feet away. My mom and dad keep a big spotlight style flashlight right by their front door because I refuse to get out of the car without them shining the light for me lol. I'm a chicken I know. But I ran and grabbed the light and started shining it along the woodline and saw tree branches moving... There was no wind so I know something had to be there. Well I went back in freaking out and sat on the couch... I waited about a hour and went back out and was just standing there and heard footsteps off to the side of their house. Again no more then 50 feet away. This time I didn't get the light because I didn't want it to run away... I sat out there for probably 15 minutes and something walked basically back and forth the whole time. I tried to take a video with my phone but it just sounds like someone breathing...,I would have to talk with someone to explain because it's way out in the country.

"I was home alone at the time watching t.v in the living room when i got a phone call from a family member that lives on the hill behind me saying my cousin's girlfriend had heard the screams. which I had heard before a few times actually. I muted the t.v and went out on the porch to see if i could hear it. i noticed that the dogs that normally barking were unusually quiet. My cousin said why don't you do a call to see if you can get a response. So I did a howl and got no response i stood on my porch for about 10 minutes and figured if there was a bigfoot in the area it probably moved on by then. I was just about to go back in the house when I noticed something moving behind a large pine tree that stands in our yard. I stood there for a moment because I thought the chickens might be roosting in the tree when I seen the sasquatch peek around the tree. I saw it and it saw me, our eyes met and he stepped out from behind the tree I ran inside but watched through the open door it kept watching me, then in 3 large steps was across the road and faded into the darkness. It had long brown hair. I measured where it stood after. and where its head was, using the pine tree for scale, I measured ten feet 2 inch tall there was one foot print in the yard I didn't have any casting supplies so I took a picture of it and measured the foot print at 17 inches.

I walked out on too the porch with the spotlight and searched the tree line but could not see anything. Less than 5 minutes later I heard the howl again then immediately another howl less than 40 yards from me. I still could not see anything. Then the next howl was behind the garage and howled twice. I then eased back into the house and quietly closed the screen door. Suddenly there were small rocks hitting the porch roof, this lasted about 7-8 minutes.

"This sighting occurred while doing a Paranormal Investigation at Octagon Hall in Franklin, Kentucky. Upon arrival, we talked to the curator of the property and he advised us that an investigator from the previous night had a possible Bigfoot sighting. He also produced a cell phone picture taken the next day of the fields about 3/4 of a mile away where the sighting took place. Around 2 a.m. a teammate and myself headed out to investigate the area in question. There is a large clump of hardwood trees and other foliage (about 3/4 mile long & 1/2 mile wide) in the middle of the otherwise barren field I vocalized a loud ""whoop"" a few times with no results. As time passed I decided to try the loudest, most guttural howl I could muster. I performed the call and heard two responses from a mile or so in the distance, but thought it could be the echo from the howl. A few minutes later my fellow investigator and I saw movement beside one of the trees about 30 - 40 yards away. We both stood still and saw a large silhouette of a humanoid figure peek out from behind a tree. It swayed left 3 times, paused; then sway 2-3 times to the right and stop.Since we weren't using our flashlights, our eyes were very attuned to the darkness.The figure was around 7 feet plus in height, the 1/2 of a large head, shoulder and arms that were past the knees.This activity continued foe a few minutes, to the point that I asked my fellow investigator if he was seeing what I was seeing. We actually took turns mimicking the movement as it happened. First me, then him. The timing and movement was exactly the same in real time as what we were viewing. We initially thought it could be a ""shadow figure"" of a large Civil War soldier, but the height, arm length and recent activity on the property prompted me to conclude that it was a flesh and blood Bigfoot sighting and not of a spiritual nature. When we tried to get closer to the figure it retreated for a final time     and was no longer there. We both went to the tree and there was nothing there that could explain the dark figure we both saw.","Octagon Hall 6040 Bowling Green Rd Franklin, Ky",Simpson County,Kentucky,Spring,36.8066,-86.5549,3/20/12,41776,Class B,83.36,73.54,63.72,0.94,Clear throughout the day.
"My encounter took place while leaving the Lake Barkley Resort.  My family and I were driving back toward the main road that leads to Cadiz, KY.  I was going about 50 miles per hour when I saw a deer run across the road. I thought I saw a tree next to the road but it was running.  It was taller then the top of my mini van and looked right at me,  we passed it in about 3 seconds.  I was not really sure what I saw so I turned around to see if it might have been a tree or something but there was nothing there.  I remember afterwards that it was a large creature, with tanish/brown fur around 7 feet tall with an almost Neanderthal brow and flatish nose.  It was hard to tell what color the fur was exactly since my headlights are tinted yellow. My son who was in the back seat also saw it and commented on it. The animal was running upright along the edge of the road. it seemed to be chasing a deer that had run in front of our van literally seconds before. It kept pace with me for about 3 steps then dropped back. When I looked in the rear view mirror, it had run off.","From Cadiz, KY - follow 68 West heading towards Land Between the Lakes.

"This is my Facebook post. Copied and pasted. Occurrence was inside Land Between the Lakes National Forest, Hillman Ferry Campground at Campsite B 43. Well. I made sure we secured the most backcountry spot where you can dump camp. I wanted away from loud people. So it is empty and quiet; covered with plenty of trees. So at about 4am, I wake up, instantly. I ask my wife what's the matter. She simply whispered she was scared. I ask about what. She said she heard noises out in the woods. Now normally, I would ask her to go back to sleep, that there's nothing wrong. But this time. Suddenly, about maybe five or six owls start hooting. And they're going non stop, back to back. Then the coyotes begin howling with them. And then every bird wakes up and begins their story. They go on continuously for about thirty seconds. Suddenly, they all stop. And so I know this is completely unusual. Then we hear it. Clump, Clump, Clump, Clump. Branches were breaking, wood was cracking with each step. And I'm like okay, that's a biped. But a human, unless it was intentionally trying to be frightening, wouldn't be tromping around. And an adult would know and expect people to have firearms. Also, the terrain would be too difficult to simply decide to go for a stroll in the woods in the middle of the night, with no guarantee to meet somebody to scare. During the day, the forest is too dense for hunting. I know there are no bears, I know it's not a deer, or any other woodland creature that is common here. So. It keeps getting closer and closer. So I cough really loud. No change in its cadence. It sounded like how I would sound walking through the woods. Heavy and sweating, full of complaints. These steps were loud. So I get out. The flashlight is in the truck. I go to the truck and rummage around for it. And I'm naked, carrying a knife in my mouth, searching through the vehicle. So I find it, and then start searching the treeline. I see nothing. But the steps stop. So, I start up the vehicle and point it towards the woods. I turn on the high beams. Nothing. I get out, turn off the lights. Start to head back to the tent, and then suddenly: Boom, boom, boom. It runs off. Tree limbs were breaking, trees were swaying. And I could hear it exhale as it ran. Sound like a combination of a boar and a man. And so, if you're familiar with Land Between the Lakes, there's a huge dogman or big foot phenomenon here. Tons of stories on YouTube about here. So I don't know. We both experienced it.

"Would like to talk to someone about noises I've been hearing since about 6 months ago. These noises haven't stopped and I have heard them every week since I've lived here for almost a year now and about 4 days ago I had a visual sighting of one about 40-50 feet away from me, they seem so very active around my house and I strongly appreciate if someone could help me in this matter.",Omitted for privacy reasons.,Larue County,Kentucky,Fall,37.51867,-86.05289,1/29/17,55870,Class A,36.02,29.81,23.6,0.05,Overcast throughout the day.
"I live in the very wooded hills of eastern kentucky. I noticed that some of my garbage behind my house had been ripped up, not reallly chewed up. Then one night about 2a.m. I let my dog out for the night and I saw him looking up the hollow(which is a very deep valley with a creek at bottom and about 4-5 caves surround the area). About 5 minutes later i heard him barking loudly like at something and i could tell, I went to the door and yelled for him to get back here thats when i heard him skuffle with something. I could not see him but, then suddenly he came running back fast and ran in the door. I then called my dad which lives right beside me and told him to bring his light and his gun something was outback trying fight the dogs. We started to walk up the hollow and heard really loud crashing and breaking of good size limbs, and also heard a grunting sound a couple time. They move for about 30 seconds very loudy breaking everything it sounded like, I heard alot of animal run in the woods but not any that just run right through the trees most animals will dodge the brush. We held the light up on the hill about 100 feet away for awhile all we heard was one constant sounds in the leaves right in front of us as something else walked around to the right of us. We left right after that because we didnt really hear anything anymore. The next day me and my dad decided that we was going to go look to see how the brush was broke or any kind of sign of what we were dealing with because we have had a big history of dogs just disappearing without a trace, and i have 3 dogs now so i want to protect them from whatever i thought it was. We walked all over the hill only finding spots where it seemed like something was bedding. As we were walking off we decided to walk down an old logging path off the hill, about half down my dad says whats that there and I look and see what looks like a really big human foot print, but like really big with a prominate heel and toes with a arch in the middle of the print. We both looked at it and looked at each other we both knew it looked like no animal track we had ever seen before and we are avid outdoorsmen. We came back down off the hill amazed by what we had found. So I got on the internet that night looking at some bigfoot stuff, i had watch some already and i believed in bigfoot but never really thought i would experience it in my own back yard. So I looked up some stuff and saw that some people had heard a banging stick sound. The next day which was April 15 2010, I went back to the footprint to take pictures, which i have and would love to share. I took the pictures and decided to start banging some sticks together to see if i could call something out. I did it for probably about 10 minutes and was about to stopped i was gonna do it 2 more times. I hit it again and right after i did I heard a loud really high pitch scream/roar that sounds just like the recording that was caught in Ohio in 1994. It scared me so bad I turned and ran a fast as i could down a really steep hill running through briars and everything, i thought i was running for my life. I made it all the way back to the house i had never been that scared in my life. Ive heard almost every animal before even a bobcat and I have no clue what made that sound. I didnt even take time to look back even though i wanted to try to attract it to snap a picture. I am definately a firm believer now and I think if someone could come investigate pretty quick it may still be hanging around. I am going to continue to try to lure it out and try to get a good clear picture( if i dont run again lol) I also have the pictures of the print that i would love to share.","West from louisa, in a area called fallsburg.",Lawrence County,Kentucky,Spring,38.11509,-82.70393,4/13/10,27589,Class B,78.36,63.78,49.2,0.97,Clear throughout the day.
"On my way from Louisa to Blaine, just before the Rich Creek boat ramp. I looked to my left to look at some horses that stay on this hill and I noticed two pine trees that I never seen before (which I thought to be pine trees). I told the person with me that I'd never seen pine trees in that spot before, she stated she had not either. No horses were around. But the next day we came by this same spot....NO PINE TREES...Whatever they were, one was standing, one was down on its knees, backs toward us, next to a big tree, color was a dark color from dark brown to a lighter brown to tips of blonde. The one standing was very large, tall and thick head came to a point. No neck that I could see. The one kneeling or on its knees, was the same almost in color, same shape in head, but didn't seem as wide at the shoulders.","If you go west on Hwy. 32 from Louisa KY.

"This is a follow-up report. It is about the 50 lb. dog food a week, and the x tree marker I found by my deer stand in early fall of 2015. First the dog food. I moved my game cam to see if I can figure out why so much dog food is has been missing. No surprise there. Just pics of me and the dogs. What is surprising is I haven't had to buy any dog food for around three weeks! Again this is down from a 50 lb. dog food bag a week to a 50 lb. bag bought over three weeks ago and the only thing changed is the camera. The other thing is what some call a tree marker. I found this in early Oct. When I went to check on my deer stands. It is made out of two large branches that cross to make a x shape. It also has a twig in the middle that is y shaped upside down. One end of the big branches is stuck in the roots of one tree and the other end is supported by the branch of another tree. The other branch that makes the x has one end stuck in the ground and the other in a branch on another tree (the one with first branch stuck in roots) with a smaller branch put in to hold it. When I first found the x marker the leaves had started falling and I found three of different colors and put them on center twig half way down the y. The next week they was gone. Ok no big deal. Before leaving I put an apple in the crook of the tree the x was on out of reach of deer and placed three more leaves on the y twig, made sure they would stay by breaking the y's end. The next week I went back and no leaves and apple is gone. Maybe some other critter got the apple, I don't know, My game cam is still on dog food. Anyway I left another apple a jar of pb and tied on a piece of blaze orange string on the x. This time a couple of weeks go by and some friends and I go riding and I asked if they would want to see the x. It was night, we rode to the x, apple was there but the peanut butter was missing. We looked around and couldn't find it. I said look for tracks, none found, so we checked out the x and my friend found a hair on the x marker. We went back home and she pulled the hair out of her pocket so we could check it out. It is an inch long and curly but the weird thing is its clear looking. I still have it and pics of the x marker, however what gets me is when I went hunting on the 21st of Nov. I went to the stand by the x marker (10 ft away) and the jar of peanut butter was on my stand with the lid on it and 2/3 missing!! I am the type that has to see or have real good proof of bf before I believe.

"Me and another person was walking up a hollow below a hollowfill. The area was very marshy as beavers have been damming up the streams. We came upon an area where the stream split in two. There was a large rock on the ""island"" and next to it we found an odd looking impression in the mud. It was approximately 14 inches in length and roughly twice as wide as my steel toe boot. I have three photographs of it. One photo shows my boot next to it. I'm not sure if what I saw is anything. But the photos clearly show what looks to me like toes but I could just be wanting to see more than what is actually there.

"On June, 18, 2014 I set out to find where two creeks merge back in the woods. On the left of a old wagon road i noticed a 17 inch footprint at the edge of the road/path. A few feet farther another 7.5 inch footprint next too a tree about 3 feet high on the bank overlooking where the creeks merge. Left my casting material in the truck; therefore, decided to walk back after taking pics.  Sunday afternoon the 22nd and after a few days of rains went back a different way. While walking next to the woods in a corn field i heard something trailing me in the woods. Determined it was somewhat large with all the noise it was making breaking  branches and logs on the ground. Went past the location where the creeks merge and doubled back. Walked towards the creeks and noticed a footprint in the field. The toes section was gone but the other 2/3rd of the foot was still there. A small print was on the back right side of the adults heal print about 2.5 to 3 inches long. Placed my backpack next to the print because no others around. The farmer had cultivated the field. Walked to the creeks and chased something into the creek. It was large by the sound of the splash, like a belly busted splash sound. It ran off and started making growls. It would do a growl  then a second later do another growl. Then a few seconds 5 to 10 seconds of silence then another set of two growls. Did this for eight sets of growls and then i did a whoop, after that whoop... silence - not another sound. Spent days looking for growls like what i heard and on Legends Beware a video taken on 12/July/2013 at the counter mark of .18 and especially 1.40 is the growl. I have been back and left peanut butter but no other tracks except a lot of deer tracks.

"This was around the end of September 2014, I recently made friends with the guy I purchased my four wheeler from.  He called me to see if I would be interested in riding on his friends property on four wheelers, I told him yes and showed up. We arrived at his friends farm with 3 four wheelers plus his friends quad which made 4 quads total, time was 21:00 eastern time. There were 5 of us that went riding 4 males one female which was my friends girlfriend. After riding for an hour on this guys farm we went to this place they call *******, its south of Berea off of US25.  Its easily a few thousand acres of undeveloped land.  We ride with no incident for an hour or so, around 2230 at night we decide to head back to the farm we left earlier in the night.  As we were heading out we stopped so everyone could catch up because some had utility quads and some had racing quads, as we waited was when the first incident took place, as we sat we heard a branch snap like it was being deliberately snapped to let us know we were not alone, it was about 50 yards to our left in thick brush, we sat there quiet and just waited to see what would happen next, I have hunted deer before and it did not sound like large game traveling thru brush, it was a single snap, no brush or leaves moving like when a animal walks, also you heard no noise at all, dead silent, insects stopped making noises, you could hear a needle drop. We decided at this point to move on, it was a strange incident but not alarming yet...  We rode up the trail about a quarter mile to half mile and stopped at a clearing in the woods to just talk, we were all present, we spoke abit about that branch and just other general things when out of no where a large, extremely large log was hurled from up the hill next to my friends four wheeler at the base of the hill, the log was a good sized log, I stood up and looked up the hill but as soon as I did this massive lime stone slab was hurled toward the same friends four wheeler and barely missed him, at this point you heard loud thumps and branches breaking like something was running down the hill with alot of weight, at this point everyone started their four wheelers and we sped out of there.  We haven't gone back since.  I am not a believer, I thought sightings were hoaxes before that night but now I cant explain what that was and I'm not ruling out the possibility that it could have been bigfoot.",,Madison County,Kentucky,Fall,37.30984,-84.20422,9/22/14,47067,Class B,68.38,56.125,43.87,0.95,Clear throughout the day.
"My husband and I are visiting family in Sandy Hook. On the evening of the 18th, at about 7:30, we got in the car to make a quick run to Sandy Hook. It was very cold, (it was already dark as well), so he started up the car to let it warm before we took off. As we were waiting, he called his grandmother -- because of the call time on his phone, we know what time this all occurred. While he was talking to her, his low fuel light came on, and they wrapped up the call at 7:45. We pulled out of the driveway and headed down the road. He was going a little faster than normal because we were a little nervous we'd run out of gas if we dilly-dallied too much. As we got into the curve about a quarter of a mile from my mom's house, I spotted something in the hollow ahead of us. It was almost out of the range of his headlights, and by my calculations, about 75-100 feet away from us. Now this all happened very very quickly, but because I am observant, especially when it comes to spotting deer crossing the road, I was able to make this observation within a couple of seconds. What I saw first was presumably an animal standing on the edge of the opposite lane. I leaned forward and scrutinized closer. Just before I could scream out, ""DEER IN THE ROAD!"" the creature began to walk very quickly, and at that moment I realized it had two legs, not four. At some point I started screaming, ""Turn on your brights! There's something in the road!"" All the while, I'm looking at this thing which is very big in stature, thick legs, thick abdomen, and (again by my calculations) at least 7 ft tall. It was the color of a tree, specifically the trees in that area, so like a grayish-brown, very earthy-tone. The area where I assume a face would be was lighter in color, but I couldn't tell what color. I know this because it turned its head and looked straight at our car. My husband saw movement and he saw what he described as a strange shadow, but he did not see the creature. Only I saw the creature, and in fairly good detail. Again, it happened so quickly though, I didn't get to see feet, hands or facial details like eyes and mouth. One thing I thought was interesting was the direction it was coming from. It was coming from a very tall and steep mountain, and when it hurried across the road, it must have gone off a very steep cliff, as that is the only place it could have gone. This cliff drops off onto Pruetts Fork Road, which is also very wooded and secluded. After we came back from our errand, we drove slowly and tried to inspect the area, but came up empty handed. That night, the neighborhood dogs were behaving very strangely, barking and howling all night long. One of them even acted as if he could see something in the distance, and began to growl and stalk before he took off to chase it. It was a very weird night.",,Elliott County,Kentucky,Fall,38.0311,-83.1815,10/18/18,61097,Class B,57.42,45.99,34.56,0.31,Clear throughout the day.
"On Jan 14th, 2010,  I was taking my son to school on Hwy. 36, outside of Sanders. We were following a Ford Ranger and were probably 30-40 foot behind it. I noticed something run quickly in front of that truck. I did not see the thing run from the opposite side of the road, though obviously that’s where it came from. I noticed it when it was right in the middle of the road. I’m guessing that the truck is between 5’ and 6’ tall. From my view, behind the truck, I could still see about 1’ of the thing over the top of the cab before it came back into full view and went up into the woods that run right by the road. During the second or two that it came back into full view after crossing in front of the truck, I was able to see it’s silhouette fully in the headlights from the truck. It was on two legs, dark in color, wide (depth of the body, from back to chest-I don’t mean the broadness of the shoulders as I saw it from the side), large legs and very tall. Because of it’s position and it being dark out, I was not able to see the face or front of it.  I’m not able to give any description of  the fur or hair that was covering it either. I wish I could tell you that I saw a Bigfoot. Since I can’t say that for sure, I will tell you what I did NOT see, for sure. I did not see a deer, elk, bear or man. The truck in front of me hit his breaks during my sighting so there is no doubt to me that he saw it as well. I should tell you that this thing crossed closely in front of him. It wasn’t like it was a great distance in front of him. I wanted to run up and talk to the man in the truck when we got to the end of the road but didn’t because I didn’t want to scare my son (who is already afraid to play outside out house by himself). As soon as this vanished from my sight, my little boy gasped and yelled, “Did you see that?”.  I responded calmly telling him that I had and asked him what he thought it was. He was unsure but said that it was big and quick. I didn’t ask any more questions at that time as I didn’t want to scare him or lead him in any way. I wanted to see what he would say about it after the ‘shock’ (?) had wore off. I asked him again this morning (Jan. 21st) what he thought it was. He said that he didn’t know. I asked him what size he thought it was and he said medium sized. I told him that I was a little over 5’ and told him to guess a size in feet and he said around 5’.",,Carroll County,Kentucky,Winter,38.63813,-85.00044,1/14/10,27184,Class B,48.07,43.25,38.43,0.98,Clear throughout the day.

"About a month ago around 9:30pm cst, I was going out to feed my dogs after working outside with the kids all day, when I heard 3 SOLID wood knocks. The series was immediately followed by a horrific cry like I've never heard before (or since until I watched the show you did in Indiana) - the series of Knocks done in Morgan forest sounded more hollow than the knocks I heard at my house - the call or scream was dead on - except the one I heard lasted longer). After dropping the bag and running in, I gained my composure and attempted to feed my dogs again about 1/2 hr later and the same thing happened again!

"OK, let me start by saying I have always been fascinated by ""Big Foot.""  I don't think it makes me biased because until recently I was always still skeptical but very curious. I recently had a sighting and was looking in the reports provided here to see if there had been many in KY.  I was shocked to see so many in KY and was completely floored when I saw a report not only in my same county but on the abandoned property behind my farm.  The report was from 1993 I think but our first sighting was in 2006. In 2006 my then 4yr old daughter told me that she saw Monkeys at the edge of my field as she was riding in my wifes car down our driveway.  She said There was a big one and a smaller one.  They both had red eyes and the bigger one looked like it was waving.  I asked her how big and she said the biggest one was a lot bigger than me (I'm 6'4"" 200lbs) and it was real hairy.  I dismissed it as a childs imagination but always kept it in mind because the description matched stories I had heard as a teenager about a big foot type creature in Lawrenceburg known as ""Howdy"" because he waves. Ive had her retell the story to friends and family over the years and it stays consistant but never much detail. I was actually jealous.  I thought, if she really did see something, why couldn't I have seen it too so I could know for sure, plus as I stated before, I was always curious.  I kept an extra eye out for a while but never saw anything and pretty much dismissed it. Modern Rifle season, November 2011.  I was deer hunting by myself on the same property (mine) that borders the abandoned ***** ******** mentioned in a previous report.  It was getting close to dusk and I was considering getting out of the deer stand soon when I saw something out of the corner of my eye.  I turned to look and  couldnt believe my eyes.  From left to right I watched 2 creatures, both larger than me and covered in long hair, running upright on 2 feet.  There was no mistake these were big foot(s).  One was very dark brown/almost black and the slightly smaller one was almost blonde.  More like coyote colored blonde.  They were both jogging with arms relaxed and looking behind them.  They ran within 25 yards right in front of me!  I honestly cant give much detail about the faces, they were looking behind them alot plus I was simply shocked and not looking for detail.  They covered ground quickly and were gone in less than 10 seconds.  They dissapeared into a clump of trees behind my pond.  I pulled my scope up but could only make out ""something' going through the woods once they passed.  I waited until almost dark and got down to look for fur or prints.  I couldnt find anything but it was cold, dark and I was shaking from the shock of seeing them and the cold combined.
